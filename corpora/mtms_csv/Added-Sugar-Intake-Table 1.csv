5,Added Sugar Intake,"Unfortunately, food labels do not usually differentiate between naturally occurring and added sugars. By comparing unsweetened and sweetened versions of similar foods, we can determine the amount of added sugar. For example, 1 serving of unsweetened plain Greek yogurt contains 6 grams of naturally occurring sugar, whereas 1 serving of sweetened vanilla Greek yogurt contains 20 grams of sugar. So, there are 14 grams of added sugar in the vanilla yogurt. ",5,Added Sugar Intake

23,Added Sugar Intake,N CTM’s Principles to Actions Professional Learning Toolkit provides grade-band-specific  professional learning modules focused on the Effective Teaching Practices and Guiding Principles from Principles to Actions: Ensuring Mathematical Success for All—NCTM’s  landmark publication that connects research with practice. Specific research-based teaching practices that are essential for a high-quality mathematics education for each and every student are combined with core principles to build a successful mathematics program at all levels.,23,Added Sugar Intake
24,Added Sugar Intake,"The Principles to Actions toolkit helps support professional learning with teachers by analyzing mathematical tasks, narrative and video cases, student work samples, vignettes, and more. Each module includes a presentation, presenter notes, and required materials. Teachers learn by abstracting general ideas from the specific examples about how to effectively support student learning.",24,Added Sugar Intake
