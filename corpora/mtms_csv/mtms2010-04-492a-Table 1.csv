"This NCTM Yearbook is a collection of articles and activities that focus on learning and teaching while supporting Standards-based geometry. Teachers at  all grade levels can quickly implement the activities using the blackline masters that are included in the companion CD. The activities are suitable for problembased learning. Classic problems, such as the Möbius strip, are used to connect geometry to the real world.",10,mtms2010-04-492a,,
Many activities are hands-on and use technology. Problems requiring geometry software allow students to explore the world of geometry with technology. The CD includes video clips to demonstrate use of the software. ,11,mtms2010-04-492a,,
"As a university professor, I used several paper-folding activities with preservice teachers. I designed a problem-based lesson with the activities that engaged students in geometry concepts and challenged the teachers to use visual-spatial skills and problem-solving skills. The lesson emphasized the importance of developing visual-spatial skills with students at all grade levels.",12,mtms2010-04-492a,,

"Implementing Standards-Based Mathematics Instruction provides a clear framework, rich case studies, and professional development tools to help teachers move from traditional teaching to methods that promote a deep understanding of mathematics. The authors introduce two core concepts: (1) identifying the cognitive demands of tasks and (2) maintaining higher-level tasks in the classroom. Their research shows that even when teachers choose higher-level tasks, they are implemented as low-level tasks about 60 percent of the time and that teachers still rely on demonstration or procedures. ",19,mtms2010-04-492a,,
"The book’s clear definitions and  examples of high-level and low-level tasks explain the difference. Sample math tasks are provided for practice in rating tasks, with more available online. The six rich case studies, taken from real classrooms, illustrate the strengths and struggles of teachers as  they work to implement high-level tasks. The case studies include guidelines for discussion and reflection on individual practice. New to this edition are chapters specifically written for professional developers and school principals to improve their math leadership, with more specific guidance on using the materials with teachers.",20,mtms2010-04-492a,,
"This book provides a realistic  picture of the difficulties that teachers face in changing their teaching methods while helping them do so. I have used the materials from the first edition in numerous teacher workshops. They always stimulate rich, paradigm-shifting discussions among teachers on academic rigor, their fears of using higher-level tasks, and strategies for success. ",21,mtms2010-04-492a,,

"Paul Lockhart, 2009. 192 pp.,  $12.95 paper. ISBN 978‑1‑ 934137‑17‑8. Bellevue Literary Press; www.blpress.org.",23,mtms2010-04-492a,,
"As the title suggests, this book critiques the current state of math education. For example, “Students learn that mathematics is not something you do, but something that is done to you” (p. 83). The book concludes with Lockhart describing a math curriculum that reflects his vision of doing mathematics. This could be an interesting read for anyone involved in mathematics or its instruction.",24,mtms2010-04-492a,,
"Evident throughout the book is Lockhart’s passion for the subject. He makes a strong case for the value of math on its own merits and not as  some procedure that is memorized and used in another context. For him, true engagement requires learners to explore math problems of their own choosing. “Math is not about following directions, it’s about making new directions” (p. 31). When speaking of math, Lockhart can come across as a visionary.",25,mtms2010-04-492a,,
"Unfortunately, when focusing on  teaching, Lockhart’s critique becomes cynical and sometimes uneven. He believes that knowing how to teach cannot be taught. He writes, “Schools of education are a complete crock” (p. 46). Painting with such broad strokes is unfair and unnecessary. It also distracts from his stronger, more salient points regarding teaching the mathematical process and not just the mathematical product.",26,mtms2010-04-492a,,
"I suggested that our math department use this book for a reading group that focuses on teaching. Everyone agreed that although the content was at times controversial, it was worth reading. Many participants left the discussion considering how to apply Lockhart’s vision of math as art in their classes.",27,mtms2010-04-492a,,

"In writing this book, Hansen draws on her own experiences as a classroom teacher, administrator, and professional development facilitator to provide an insightful reference for the math coach. Hansen provides readers with well-thought-out details examining the role of, and how to get started as, a math coach; collaborating with  the universe” (p. 12). The community he developed in Italy, a group called the Pythagoreans, was both a spiritual sect as well as followers of a school of numbers. The idea that Pythagoras “raised mathematics to the rank of a science” (p. xiii) is surmised from manuscripts written “centuries after his time” since “Pythagoras left no records” (p. xiv). But herein lies the mystery of Pythagoras’ Revenge: A discovery is made that points to the existence of a manuscript written by Pythagoras.",30,mtms2010-04-492a,,
"The book offers numerous learning opportunities as an enrichment tool for high school students or as one piece of the curriculum for mathematics and mathematics education majors. Topics of exploration include Pythagoras, mathematics history, and  his philosophy of life. Also discussed are probability, permutations, irrational numbers, randomness, computer science, Pythagorean triples, the Pythagorean theorem, proofs, and Platonic solids. ",31,mtms2010-04-492a,,
"Several topics in the book— including smuggling, reincarnation, divorce, sex outside of marriage, hypnosis, religion, burglary, alcohol use, sexual abuse in jails, breaking and entry, destruction of historical sites, kidnapping, and lying—may require discussion with certain audiences.",32,mtms2010-04-492a,,
"Pythagoras’ Revenge is a fun and  inspiring read for adults who are passionate about mathematics. Although some facts about Pythagoras are repetitive, and patience is needed to wade through some extensive explanations of mathematics topics, the  administrators; carrying out one-onone teacher collaborations; understanding how to work with a group of teachers; and working with an entire staff of math teachers or with a small group. Discussions are also included on structures for examining teacher practice, challenges the math coach will face, and how to evaluate success. ",33,mtms2010-04-492a,,
"This book is well organized. It contains many reflective questions that math coaches could ask themselves. Sufficient details are also provided to ensure that a new coach could easily get started or that an established coach could reflect on his or her own practice. For example, the chapter describing one-on-one collaboration details how to plan a preconference, guidelines for classroom observations, and how to plan a postconference. The appendix includes a preconference guide, classroom observation forms, and a postconference guide.",34,mtms2010-04-492a,,
"Hansen has grounded this book in the Standards, Curriculum Focal Points, and Professional Teaching Standards. It is a good resource for math coaches, classroom teachers, and teacher educators who provide extensive professional development for teachers.  —Juliana Utley, Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, OK 74078",35,mtms2010-04-492a,,

"This resource is a set of transparencies with an accompanying Teacher’s Guide that is appropriate for teachers of beginning algebra. Each transparency in the set is interactive, because it contains an overlaying transparency wheel to make new problems by changing variables or lines. The transparencies could be used for lesson openers, reviews, instruction, or quick assessments. ",42,mtms2010-04-492a,,
"The set’s three interactive transparencies involve six topics, including exponents, solving equations, and factoring polynomials. The accompanying Teacher’s Guide includes suggested uses and examples, along with a reproducible student worksheet and answer key for each of the eighteen lessons. ",43,mtms2010-04-492a,,
"For example, one graphing lesson focuses on slope. The interactive transparency is a coordinate grid, with one coordinate marked in each quadrant. A line on a clear wheel is fixed at the origin, and the line can be rotated about the graph. The Teacher’s Guide suggests counting the slope, completing a table of points, and writing an equation for the line. Four additional exercises are found on the accompanying student activity sheet.",44,mtms2010-04-492a,,
"This resource is a handy tool  that contains a thoughtful variety of examples. It is especially useful for teachers using overhead projectors. A weakness of this product is that it may be less useful in a classroom with more advanced technology. When using this product in my classroom, students appreciated the visual appeal and clarity of the concepts presented on the transparencies. ",45,mtms2010-04-492a,,
