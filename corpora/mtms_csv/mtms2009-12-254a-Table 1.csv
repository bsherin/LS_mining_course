"Keeping these two variations in  mind, we created a scenario in which students had to address a social problem-solving situation. Their answers involved forming multiple representations of rational numbers as fractions, decimals, and percents. We believe that designing an activity of this type results in more active engagement as students practice converting one representation to another. ",4,mtms2009-12-254a,,
"To test this idea, we presented the Popcorn problem to preservice middle school teachers.

"Students gather data, record and analyze their data, and ultimately try to interpret how the data play a role in helping them make a decision. The materials needed include— 1.  three different brands of popcorn; 2.  paper towels (unpopped, and later popped, corn will be spread out on paper towels for counting);  3.  plastic bowls (for catching the  popped corn); and  4.  hot air poppers.

"It is ideal to have one popper per group, but you can also designate one popper per brand and ask groups to take turns using the three. Students should work in teams of three or four and divide the counting and recording tasks among them. ",11,mtms2009-12-254a,,

"5.  Other than amount of popped kernels,  what other factors might affect your choice of what constitutes the best popcorn? dents typically discussed results using percent terminology. We learned that students prefer expressing numbers verbally in percent form, because they believe percents are easier to read. As one student said, “You just have to read the number you see and then say the word percent after it.” When asked more about this, one student explained, “You hear things said this way [in percents] more.” ",19,mtms2009-12-254a,,
"Another student noted that she  tends to “see percent signs in stores or on television,” so she is familiar with them. Nevertheless, students were comfortable seeing percent as an accurate representation of their original fraction-form data. Thus, the activity provided an opportunity to demonstrate the seamlessness of the multiple representations of these rational numbers and the power of percent to express part of a whole.  2. The students described their connection to the Popcorn problem in a manner consistent with naturalistic and interpersonal intelligences. Typical student comments regarding what they liked most about the activity included collecting the data, figuring out what the data suggested, and discussing the best popcorn value with their group  members. These preferences relate to the collecting, sorting, and examining actions connected to naturalistic intelligence and the relating and organizing tendencies of interpersonal intellgence.

I couldn’t wait to see which one popped the best.” Although she was eager to compare the outcomes, she noted that her group struggled when deciding what counted as being popped. She explained, “Some of the kernels weren’t popped all the way like a regular piece of popcorn.” The class discussed this issue, and students decided to count a kernel as being popped if any part of it had changed from its original kernel form.

"ing the whole problem because I knew I’d get to eat at the end.” The activity clearly tapped into the areas it was designed to motivate and connected to students’ “sensitivity to and skill with certain kinds of stimuli” (Kagan and Kagan 1998, p. 320). Thus, a key benefit of drawing on naturalistic and interpersonal intelligences was that we were able to stimulate those students who best learn by examining data and interacting with others (Armstrong 1994).  3. The students found that their numerical result was only one factor that influenced their decision of best value. Other factors they noted were taste, appearance (i.e., whether the kernels were fully popped and shaped as you would expect), and the perceived quantity. (In some cases, fewer popped kernels appeared to result in more popcorn because some popcorn was larger than another brand.) One student expressed disappointment in the brand that popped the most kernels in her group, saying, “Brand A popped more, but it doesn’t look like there’s much there.” She added, “Brand C looks like you have more because the popcorn is real puffy.” Most groups were surprised that  the popular brands of popcorn usually did not pop the highest percent of kernels. In addition, when prices of the different brands were compared, the best value (the most popped kernels) most often turned out to be the middle-level brand of popcorn, that is, neither the most nor least expensive but the brand somewhere in between. However, many students did not think the price was a big consideration. One student explained, “Since the prices aren’t that different, a dollar or two dollars off, I’d get the one that looks like you get more popcorn for the party.” iMPlications FoR teaching and leaRning",39,mtms2009-12-254a,,
Implementing the Popcorn problem revealed a solid relationship between specifically targeted multiple intelligences and students’ ability to recognize and use the skills inherent to each of them. We encourage teachers to explore mathematics instruction with the goal of stimulating and developing skills related to each type of intelligence (Armstrong 1994). ,40,mtms2009-12-254a,,
"Further, teacher educators should expose preservice teachers to the theory of multiple intelligences and its potential to suggest mathematics activities that tap into students’ various ways of thinking, particularly those that develop logicalmathematical and spatial intelligences (Gardner 1999), which relate more concretely to mathematical reasoning.
