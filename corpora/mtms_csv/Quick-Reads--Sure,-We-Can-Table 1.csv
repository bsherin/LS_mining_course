3,"Quick Reads: Sure, We Can Make Smaller Pieces","The topic of limit, in addition to being an important mathematical concept, is also a significant stumbling block for many students. To introduce the idea of limit, some activities from the regular middle school math curriculum can be extended to give students a picture of the concept and provide a preliminary frame for the symbolic treatment that will be found in later classes. This article demonstrates how students’ prior understanding of the formula for the area of circles can be used to bridge other mathematical concepts.",3,"Quick Reads: Sure, We Can Make Smaller Pieces"

A descriptive approach is accessible to middle school and high school students and will allow them to develop a working definition that can be easily extended to more formal treatments of advanced algebra and calculus. ",5,"Quick Reads: Sure, We Can Make Smaller Pieces"
6,"Quick Reads: Sure, We Can Make Smaller Pieces","For example, a traditional dictionary definition of limit is “the point, edge, or line beyond which something cannot or may not proceed” (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt 2011). This concept will be familiar to most students who recognize speed limits, curfew limits, and cell phone or texting plan limits. In mathematics, however, limit describes the value that a function or sequence approaches as the input  approaches some infinitely large or  infinitely small value (Stewart 2008). An important distinction between these two definitions is that the common meaning implies a hard boundary (such as a speed limit),  which allows for a range of acceptable outcomes; the mathematical context refers to limits as being “approached” but never reached. This distinction can confuse students when the mathematical limit is reported as a single number. ",6,"Quick Reads: Sure, We Can Make Smaller Pieces"
7,"Quick Reads: Sure, We Can Make Smaller Pieces","In contrast, an intuitive approach to limit could extend students’ mathematical understanding by building on what they already know. For example, teachers could introduce an approach based on a student’s intuition of what might happen when asked to find the sum of many very small areas. We begin with an activity that explores a connection between the area formula for triangles and the area formula for circles. The following steps describe an activity that can be modeled by a teacher on multiple types of displays (static or interactive, using a document camera or dynamic geometry software) as students follow along and create their own shapes. This activity aligns with the sixth-grade and seventh-grade recommendations in ",7,"Quick Reads: Sure, We Can Make Smaller Pieces"

11,"Quick Reads: Sure, We Can Make Smaller Pieces","Step 1 Provide handouts of a circle. Ask students to draw diameters dividing a circle into sectors of equal size (see fig. 1), much like a cross section of an orange. Next, students cut the circle into successively smaller sectors. Pause and ask students what they see. Without much prompting, they will probably mention that the pieces resemble triangles. Some might identify them as isosceles triangles (except that the base is an arc, not a segment). Although this response is accurate and should be recognized, it is not really necessary and is only a peripheral learning objective. Do not ask students to connect across the base angles to make triangles just yet. ",11,"Quick Reads: Sure, We Can Make Smaller Pieces"
12,"Quick Reads: Sure, We Can Make Smaller Pieces","Step 2 Ask students to draw additional diameters to divide the circle into more equal sectors by halving every sector. Help them discover that as the number of sectors increases (doubles, in this case), the area of each sector decreases by one-half. Mention that ",12,"Quick Reads: Sure, We Can Make Smaller Pieces"
13,"Quick Reads: Sure, We Can Make Smaller Pieces",Fig. 2 Students can easily generate  congruent isosceles triangles from  congruent sectors of a circle.,13,"Quick Reads: Sure, We Can Make Smaller Pieces"
14,"Quick Reads: Sure, We Can Make Smaller Pieces","if students used a very sharp pencil to draw sectors, they could continue this process for a long time. After students have divided their circles into at least 8 sectors, ask them to connect the endpoints on two adjacent diagonals to make a triangle (see fig. 2). Be sure they notice that a small area is bounded by the arc of the circle and the base segment of the triangle. Draw attention to this area, and note that as the number of triangles increases, the area between the base segment and the circle decreases.",14,"Quick Reads: Sure, We Can Make Smaller Pieces"

Note that the arc begins to shrink, and the area between it and the base segment also shrinks. Ask students what else they notice. Lead students to conclude that as the triangles become thinner, the height of the triangles begins to approach the length of the two congruent length sides. The area between the base segments and the arc of the circles almost disappears (see fig. 3).",19,"Quick Reads: Sure, We Can Make Smaller Pieces"

21,"Quick Reads: Sure, We Can Make Smaller Pieces",Another Approach with Wedges,21,"Quick Reads: Sure, We Can Make Smaller Pieces"
22,"Quick Reads: Sure, We Can Make Smaller Pieces",A somewhat similar approach to this activity is to ask students to cut the circle into segments and then rearrange the segments into a shape that resembles a parallelogram (an activity sheet with a circle divided into sectors	can	be	found	on	NCTM’s	Illuminations	website	 at http://illuminations.nctm.org/Lessons/ApplePi/Apple Pi-AS-FractionCircles.pdf). ,22,"Quick Reads: Sure, We Can Make Smaller Pieces"
23,"Quick Reads: Sure, We Can Make Smaller Pieces","When the sectors are arranged as shown below, the height of the “parallelogram” approaches the height of the triangles, and the base of the shape approaches  1/2 the circumference of the circle, or (2pr)/2, or pr.  Using the formula for the area of a parallelogram  (base × height), in which the base is pr and the height is r, we get pr × r = pr2. As the number of sectors increases, the more the shape resembles a parallelogram. ",23,"Quick Reads: Sure, We Can Make Smaller Pieces"
24,"Quick Reads: Sure, We Can Make Smaller Pieces","Once again, when the sectors get very thin, invite the  students to engage in the same thought experiment as before: What would this shape look like if the triangles arranged in this way were all infinitely thin? height approaches the length of the circle radius, and the sum of all the bases approaches the circumference of the circle.  ",24,"Quick Reads: Sure, We Can Make Smaller Pieces"
25,"Quick Reads: Sure, We Can Make Smaller Pieces","Before formalizing the mathematical concept, ask students to share in a thought experiment: thinking about and making conjectures about things they cannot actually do. Albert Einstein won a Nobel Prize for the theories he developed while imagining he  was riding on a train that travelled 99.9 percent of the speed of light. With this circle activity, have students consider what would happen if we were able to draw an infinite number of diagonals. The result would be an unlimited number of infinitely thin sectors, all of which, when added, would equal the complete circle. The number of triangles we could make is infinite.

27,"Quick Reads: Sure, We Can Make Smaller Pieces","(a) 16 sectors (b) 32 sectors and outside the base of the triangles would continue to shrink as the  number of triangles increased.  As we continued to draw, the circle would be filled by little triangles,  and there would be less and less  space between the triangles and  the circle. ",27,"Quick Reads: Sure, We Can Make Smaller Pieces"
28,"Quick Reads: Sure, We Can Make Smaller Pieces","So here’s the point: We cannot draw lines thin enough to actually measure the side lengths and calculate the sum of all the areas. But by imagining all the little triangles, we do not need to calculate the total area. Instead, we can use what we already know about triangles, circles, and area to discover a way to find the area of any circle. ",28,"Quick Reads: Sure, We Can Make Smaller Pieces"
29,"Quick Reads: Sure, We Can Make Smaller Pieces","To formalize, let’s think about the triangles packed into the circle through the following steps: 1.  Let the number of triangles  be n, and call the length of  the base of each triangle b.  2.  The triangles resulting from  our drawing are so thin that  the height (h) of each triangle  is infinitesimally close to the  radius of the circle. We can say  that the height (h) must equal  the radius (r).",29,"Quick Reads: Sure, We Can Make Smaller Pieces"

35,"Quick Reads: Sure, We Can Make Smaller Pieces","7.  Substituting 2pr for (n × b) in  step 5, we have (2pr × h)/2, but  h is now equivalent to r because  the triangles are so thin that the height is the same as the radius. We can now write: × =",35,"Quick Reads: Sure, We Can Make Smaller Pieces"
36,"Quick Reads: Sure, We Can Make Smaller Pieces","So the area of a circle is pr2 when we have taken an infinite number of triangles. In calculus, when one completes a calculation that requires making something either infinitely large (here, the number of triangles) or small (the size of each triangle), it is called the limit.  students understand",36,"Quick Reads: Sure, We Can Make Smaller Pieces"
37,"Quick Reads: Sure, We Can Make Smaller Pieces","When I have completed this activity with middle school and high school students, they readily grasp the concept of limit and generally think that “it’s pretty cool.” More important, this activity allows students to gain more experience working with the formulas for the area and circumference of circles (and the difference between the two). In addition, through deriving a  known formula, students are able to successfully investigate an intuitive concept of limit. ",37,"Quick Reads: Sure, We Can Make Smaller Pieces"
