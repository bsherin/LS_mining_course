6,Window on Resources  September 2013,"When I first glanced at the material in this book, I felt that the intended audience might be teachers new to the profession. After reviewing the content, I realize that my initial perception was incorrect. The purpose of this resource is to provide visuals that will draw out mathematical thinking in students. After my review, I believe that this book is best suited for more experienced teachers because ",6,Window on Resources  September 2013

10,Window on Resources  September 2013,"Because I am a middle school  teacher, I focused on the material in the elementary and middle school sections. I found the majority of these examples to be excellent introductions to new concepts to students. Most of the visuals represented the mathematical concepts in ways that make natural connections, such as the real-world applications of integers. Occasionally the visuals did not make these connections, such as when an illustration of cherries, meant to show a negative number, was used to represent multiplication and division of integers. Students struggle to understand this concept, and a strong connection needs to be made. ",10,Window on Resources  September 2013
11,Window on Resources  September 2013,I think this book will be an excellent resource to use for preassessment and postassessment discussions on a variety of essential mathematical concepts. The material included could  also easily be turned into writing prompts. I recommend this resource to teachers who have a solid mathematical background and are capable of seeing mathematics in a variety of ways.  —Patricia Kridler,11,Window on Resources  September 2013

These questions can be used to differentiate the lesson for students who are ready to delve deeper into the concepts.",16,Window on Resources  September 2013
17,Window on Resources  September 2013,"All activities in the book support  the Common Core’s Standards for Mathematical Practice. Both novice and veteran teachers will benefi t from the rich dialogue that the discussion questions generate among their students. The questions encourage students to conjecture, make arguments and justifi cations, create mathematical models, and reason both abstractly and quantitatively. The real-world contexts in which the activities are situated allow students to create stronger connections between the concepts they are learning and the world around them. Many of the activities also help support students’ conceptual development because they use both algebra and geometry. This is extremely important in helping students appreciate that mathematics is a highly integrated discipline.",17,Window on Resources  September 2013

Overall, this book offers a nice assortment of inquirybased activities to help create a richer, more meaningful learning environment for students.",18,Window on Resources  September 2013

24,Window on Resources  September 2013,"Each chapter  begins with a scenario accompanied by a graph, table, and symbolic representation. This initial example makes the relationship among the three mathematical representations visible, which is a defi nite strength of the book. One overall weakness is that after the initial example, the work is done almost solely with symbols, without relating back to any other representation. Graphing quadratic functions, for example, is in a different section that solves quadratic functions symbolically, rather than graphing zeros in the factoring section and graphing the symmetry in the completing-the-square section.",24,Window on Resources  September 2013
