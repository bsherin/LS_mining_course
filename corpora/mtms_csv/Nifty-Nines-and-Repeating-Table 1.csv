0,Nifty Nines and Repeating Decimals - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The traditional technique for converting repeating decimals to common fractions can be found in nearly every algebra textbook that has been published, as well as in many precalculus texts. However, students generally encounter repeating decimal numerals earlier than high school when they study rational numbers in prealgebra classes. Therefore, how do prealgebra students in the middle grades convert repeating decimals to fractions without using the age-old algebraic process (multiplying and finding the difference of two stacked equations) or without applying the precalculus approach of treating repeating decimal digits as an infinite geometric series?",,
1,Nifty Nines and Repeating Decimals - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Perhaps this is not a critical skill now that we have access to technology and can derive many of these conversions with a few keystrokes on the graphing calculator or computer. Nevertheless, I have created a repeating decimal-to-fraction conversion activity to integrate inductive and deductive methods in a nonalgebraic context that actually leads to a formal, but less conventional, algebraic justification of the conversion process. I call the activity Nifty Nines. The Nifty Nines activity engages students in processes that are central to the development of concept and operation understandings involving rational numbers. This activity aligns nicely with NCTMs Number and Operations Standard as found in Principles and Standards for School Mathematics (NCTM 2000, p. 215).",,
2,Nifty Nines and Repeating Decimals - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In grades 35, students should have learned to generate and recognize equivalent forms of fractions, decimals, and percentages, at least in some simple cases. In the middle grades, students should build on and extend these experiences, so that using fractions, decimals, and percentages becomes a meaningful activity",,
3,Nifty Nines and Repeating Decimals - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The inductive structure included in the activity supports the Reasoning and Proof Standard for Grades 68 (NCTM 2000, p. 262), which states the following:",,

9,Nifty Nines and Repeating Decimals - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In addition, Nifty Nines ties to the seventh-grade Number and Operations Connection found in NCTMs Curriculum Focal Points for Prekindergarten through Grade 8 Mathematics (NCTM 2006, p. 19). The activity also supports the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSM), which states that students in grade 7 should know that the decimal form of a rational number terminates in 0s or eventually repeats (CCSSI 2010, p. 49). The activity also ties into CCSSMs goals for grade 8, in that students should convert a decimal expansion which repeats eventually into a rational number (CCSSI 2010, p. 54).",,
10,Nifty Nines and Repeating Decimals - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,THE ACTIVITIES,,
11,Nifty Nines and Repeating Decimals - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Exploring repeating decimals is fascinating. Predictable patterns abound as students divide numerators by denominators to convert fractions to decimals. How do we look at the process of converting repeating decimals back to fractions? Essentially, two cases need to be considered: (1) Decimals with simple periodic representations and (2) decimals with delayed periodic representations (Usiskin et. al. 2003). Usiskin and his colleagues provide an excellent formal discussion, formulae, and related proofs for arithmetic (nonalgebraic) conversions of both types of decimal numerals. Although not as current, Sherzer (1989) provides a simple and effective technique, as well. In fact, Sherzers technique served as part of my motivation to create Nifty Nines.",,
12,Nifty Nines and Repeating Decimals - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,DISCOVERING NIFTY NINES,,
13,Nifty Nines and Repeating Decimals - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Activity sheet 1 provides an opportunity for prealgebra students to work in small groups to formulate conjectures regarding the relationship between common fractions and decimals with simple periodic representations (Usiskin et. al. 2003). Students are simply asked to explore, share, discuss, and write observations about relationships between numerators, denominators, and the associated decimal repetends (see fig. 1). These observations are based on several conversion trials using a hand-held calculator.",,
14,Nifty Nines and Repeating Decimals - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
15,Nifty Nines and Repeating Decimals - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,USING NIFTY NINES,,
16,Nifty Nines and Repeating Decimals - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Students are then asked to reverse the process (see activity sheet 2), using what they have previously observed to convert numbers in decimal form back to their corresponding fractions. Finally, students are asked to discuss their findings and summarize by recording a simple rule for converting a repeating decimal numeral to a fraction when the decimals repetend begins in the tenths place (see fig. 2).",,
17,Nifty Nines and Repeating Decimals - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
18,Nifty Nines and Repeating Decimals - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"RAISING, OR SHIFTING, THE BAR",,
19,Nifty Nines and Repeating Decimals - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Activity sheet 3 considers decimals with delayed periodic representations (Usiskin et. al. 2003). Students are shown how to integrate the Nifty Nines strategy with axioms of arithmetic, forming a logically sequenced argument that leads to the desired fractional conclusion. This activity is a useful process for decimal-to-fraction conversion that also reinforces the role of inverse, identity, and associativity in an arithmetic context. The recorded steps demonstrate the structure of logical-mathematical reasoning, which gives students an early glimpse at the underpinnings of algebraic proof in a prealgebra context. Although undergraduate students majoring in elementary education may find the references to arithmetic axioms familiar and require little or no guidance completing this part of the activity, I have found that teacher guidance (direct instruction) is quite helpful (actually, quite necessary) before middle school student groups begin their work on the five exercises. Figure 3 shows a seventh-grade students work.",,

21,Nifty Nines and Repeating Decimals - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,NIFTY NINES REVISITED: WHY ALL THOSE 9S?,,
22,Nifty Nines and Repeating Decimals - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Activity sheet 4 is intended as a teacher resource or as an algebraic extension or follow-up for more advanced students who have completed the Nifty Nines activities. Although the first two activities were written primarily for middle school prealgebra students (or preservice teachers), this activity is most appropriate for students who are fluent with algebraic representations. Although the mathematics is closely related to the traditional algebra textbook approach for converting repeating decimals to fractions, this method involves a bit of a notational departure. Here, students are asked to journey through a more formal deductive process by carefully following technical instructions and experiencing (perhaps for the first time) subscripted variables representing the digits of a number. If the level of student independence required in the small-group context is not appropriate for a particular class, then the instructor can simply lead the students in an interactive discussion, using the activity sheet as a guide.",,

24,Nifty Nines and Repeating Decimals - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,IMPROVING FLUENCY WITH REPEATING DECIMALS,,
25,Nifty Nines and Repeating Decimals - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In sum, I have found the Nifty Nines activities to be a terrific set of exercises for middle school students as well as preservice elementary and middle school teachers. These two activities enable students to extend their understanding of rational numbers without calling on algebraic equation-solving skills. In their investigation of fractions and terminating decimals, students are naturally drawn to the question, What about the decimals that repeat? Are these numbers also rational? Typically, after completing the activities (a day or two later), I like to survey student ability to connect simple periodic decimal representation on the calculator to numerals in fractional form and, ideally, to rational numbers in general (see fig. 4).",,
26,Nifty Nines and Repeating Decimals - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
27,Nifty Nines and Repeating Decimals - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Conversion between fractions and repeating decimals is also included in a summative assessment at the conclusion of the unit on decimal concepts and operations. Whether they are middle school students or undergraduate students, the students consistently demonstrate improved fluency with repeating decimals.",,
28,Nifty Nines and Repeating Decimals - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Finally, algebra students are not often given the opportunity to construct formal, logically constructed, arguments (proofs), and they often skim through this type of exposition in the textbook. Nifty Nines Revisited moves students in algebra (or preservice teachers) to a more formal consideration of the Nifty Nines discoverywhy those 9s show up in the denominator of these fractions.",,
29,Nifty Nines and Repeating Decimals - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"With Nifty Nines, I have found that students can successfully expand their understanding of the set of rational numbers to include those pesky repeating decimals.",,
