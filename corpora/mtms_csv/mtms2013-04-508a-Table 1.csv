Interpreting Box Plots with Multiple Linked Representations,1,mtms2013-04-508a,,
"S. Asli Özgün-Koca and Thomas G. Edwards bBox plots are representations that  are used for organizing and displaying data. They are easy to create but not so easy to understand. Students also find them difficult to translate or match with other representations of the same data. Thus, box plots can provide a vehicle for fostering higher-order thinking as students interpret and make sense of them. Pfannkuch (2006) suggests that math instruction begin with dot plots and move toward using box plots by dividing the data into groups in the dot plot representation.",2,mtms2013-04-508a,,
"Handheld technology, such as calculators, have capabilities that can be exploited to support students’ higherorder thinking. Using their ability to link multiple representations, students can interpret box plots and make connections among different representations. The Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSM) states that sixth graders are expected to “display numerical data in plots on a number line, including dot plots, histograms, and box plots” (CCSSI 2010, p. 45). In this exploration, we want to advance this expectation for students so that they can reason about ",3,mtms2013-04-508a,,

"TI-Nspire™, specifically, the splitscreen feature, we created an activity designed to help students interpret box plots more effectively by making connections between box plots  and dot plots or between box plots and histograms. When using a split screen, points that are highlighted on the graph in one screen are also highlighted on the graph in the other screen (see activity sheet 1). The questions on activity sheets 1 and 2 are presented in a real-world context, thus aiming to promote higher-order thinking as students experience math both in context and out of context and move back and forth between them.",6,mtms2013-04-508a,,
"We completed this activity in five  sixth-grade classes. It was the first time that many of the students had used TI-Nspire calculators. Students worked in pairs, and each pair had one calculator. We observed students helping each other follow the activity, both conceptually and technologically.  At the time, we provided only oral directions for the calculator steps.

"We also recommend balancing discussion and individual reflection time during the activity. As we moved through the activity as a whole class, we also allowed for individual and pair reflections, which were followed by group or whole-class discussions. In this way, the activity became more manageable, and students could build on their own and their classmates’ thinking as the activity progressed. ",33,mtms2013-04-508a,,
"When asking students to write  their observations or conjectures, we gave them time to reflect on their own before opening the discussion to the class.

Potential difficulties,35,mtms2013-04-508a,,
"Interpreting the box plot was not easy for some. We observed that a few students were not able to reason why one whisker was longer than the other in the first box plot in question 5 on  activity sheet 1 (see, also, fig. 1). One  fig. 2 The TI-Nspire allows students to simultaneously view the box plot and dot plot representation of the first set of data.",36,mtms2013-04-508a,,

"whisker with the location of the larger numbers on the number  line, rather than because the right whisker represented a larger range  of numbers.",39,mtms2013-04-508a,,
"Another student wrote that the  right whisker is longer “because there are more values in that range of numbers.” Students often make this error. When explaining why one box is longer than another, students might be thinking about a bar graph in which the length of the bar refers to more data points, rather than thinking about the spread of the data. Therefore, we followed these questions with a task in which students split the screen so that they could see the dot plot and box plot at the same time. When they clicked on a box or whisker, they saw the corresponding data points in the dot plot (see  fig. 2). Seeing that each box or whisker included the same number of data points was an aha! moment for many students. Finally, we concluded the first task with contextual questions aimed at helping students interpret box plots by thinking back to the original context.",40,mtms2013-04-508a,,
"Activity sheet 2 asked students to change the dot plot representing the number of raisins in boxes of cereal to a histogram (see fig. 3). Although a few students connected a wider box plot with more data, other students  believed that “the narrower it is on the box plot, the taller it is on the histogram” or “the higher the bar, the shorter the whiskers will be.” Similar to the first task, we went back to the context of the data by asking which brand students would choose to guess the number of raisins in the box of cereal (see fig. 4 and activity sheet 2). ",41,mtms2013-04-508a,,
"Some students stated that they would choose brand A (see fig. 4) because “there are more guesses for it and they are spread out.” Although there were more numbers to guess from, this student was able to see the distribution of the data points in brand A. Others chose brand B “because there is a smaller amount of guesses they could choose and it would be easy to guess” or “because I think there are more numbers stacked up.” Both students cleverly chose brand B because of the small range of numbers to guess from. However, it is noteworthy that the latter student was able to visualize the histogram or dot plot and see the stacked points when looking at the narrower boxes or whiskers.",42,mtms2013-04-508a,,
"The attention to representational  fluency in such reform documents as NCTM’s Reasoning and Sense Making series and CCSSM point us toward possible ways to extend the activity. Because representational fluency requires a student to move back  and forth between representations, possible extensions include these: •	 Begin	with	a	dot	plot	and	ask	 questions about what the corresponding histogram or box plot would look like.",43,mtms2013-04-508a,,

"TI-Nspire can be used to quickly construct the plot in question to confirm or clarify students’ ideas. In this way, students can develop representational fluency among all three representations. One final extension could be to manipulate (grab and move) the data points in the dot plot representation and watch the effects of those manipulations on the box plot in a split screen (Burrill 2011). In this dynamic, visually powerful environment, students can obtain  immediate feedback for their  manipulations.  adVantages and disadVantages",46,mtms2013-04-508a,,
"Although Pfannkuch (2006) suggested starting with dot plots before studying box plots, dot plots are not commonly used in many textbooks and classrooms. The dot plot presents the data in a way that is closest  to its raw form. The data are not aggregated as in a histogram or box plot. Perhaps that is why, when we start with the dot plot, we can build a bridge to other representations of the same data more effectively. ",47,mtms2013-04-508a,,
"There are advantages and disadvantages to any representation of data because a representation highlights some characteristics of the data set while hiding others. Studying multiple representations will help students not only see connections among representations but also understand why one representation might be more appropriate than another. At some point, students will need to be able to read and interpret different representations of data in the workplace or at home. Being aware of different representations of data and having a critical eye when interpreting a representation are crucial skills. ",48,mtms2013-04-508a,,
