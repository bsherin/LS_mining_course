1,Hair_ Weft and Weave - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,The two most common methods of attaching purchased hair are the sew-in technique and the bonded-glue technique. There are advantages and disadvantages to both methods.,,
2,Hair_ Weft and Weave - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,The sew-in technique has a more natural appearance and involves braiding the purchased hair into a woman’s natural hair.,,
3,Hair_ Weft and Weave - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The bonded-glue technique is preferred by women whose natural hair is thinning. (One downside is that the glue can leave a sticky residue.) The resulting look is called a weave and requires regular maintenance appointments. At a typical weave maintenance appointment, a stylist will wash the hair, check for any unsightly issues, and/or reapply the bonded glue.",,
4,Hair_ Weft and Weave - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"1. Sarah likes the look of a weave but is on a limited budget.

6,Hair_ Weft and Weave - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,2. Find the cost if Sarah decides to do a bonded-glue weave rather than use the sew-in method. Use the chart above.,,
7,Hair_ Weft and Weave - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"3. If Sarah becomes unhappy with her natural hair color, she may get and maintain highlights in the weave. Highlights require maintenance appointments every 3 months. Full highlights cost $90. Each appointment to maintain or retouch highlights costs $40. Determine how much extra the full highlights would cost to get and maintain for 6 months.",,
