5,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation,"What does it look like to understand operations with fractions? The Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSM) uses the term “understand” when describing expectations for students’ knowledge related to each of the fraction operations within grades 4 through 6 (CCSSI 2010). Furthermore, CCSSM elaborates that students should be able to perform fraction computations using visual models and when such problems are presented in context.  does it mean to “understand fraction operations”? What types of issues occur that might not be encountered otherwise when solving problems in context and using visual models? What follows are our experiences working with prospective teachers to describe their errors and how those errors might be addressed. Because the prospective teachers were our students, we will refer to them throughout as “students.” ",5,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation
6,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation,"I fi rst started to make 1 3/4 not a mixed fraction, so I made it 7/4, which I’m not sure if it’s right. And then to multiply it, I fl ipped the 2 and the 1. And then I was going to try to cross multiply but I got confused, because it’s not set up as an equation. So  then I was trying to figure out how to solve it if they need a common denominator. And I did that and that didn’t really look right to me, because I got 7/4 × 8/4, and that didn’t seem right. So then I was thinking, well maybe you just multiply the top and the bottom, so I got 14/4. I don’t know.",6,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation
7,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation,"The student attempted to incorporate three different procedures to solve this problem including (1) “flipping” the second fraction and multiplying, (2) finding common denominators, and (3) using cross multiplication. When students know procedures without understanding them, they can easily become confused regarding their use. Also, when an appropriate procedure is applied correctly, students may not know if the solution is correct. ",7,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation
8,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation,"The student quoted above found the correct answer of 14/4, although she was still unsure of her result. Would this student have had more success if the problem had been situated within a context? Our position is that she would. The purpose of this  article is to uncover other issues that emerge when understanding fraction operations is sought through presenting problems in context. ",8,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation
9,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation,"Contextualized problems that require fraction operations can help students make sense of the numbers and procedures (Reed 1999; Sharp and Adams 2002). Using word problems enables students “to understand why a procedure works because each step can be related to properties of objects that support the procedures” (Reed 1999, p. 40). With NCTM (2000) and CCSSM (CCSSI 2010) advocating for students to understand fraction operations and for teachers to create word problems for them, it is increasingly important to develop students’ understanding of both the operations and the numbers. ",9,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation
10,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation,"According to CCSSM, students in grades 4 through 6 are to base understanding of operations with fractions on operations with whole numbers.

Some ",10,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation
11,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation,"Fig. 1 Students typically use a visual model that supports the context of the problem when first exploring fraction operations based on contexts. For this problem, the context describes eating 3/4 of a pizza, then 5/8 of another pizza.",11,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation

14,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation,"Problems that start with one amount and increase by another amount are called join problems (Carpenter et al. 1999). For example, consider the following expression and an associated word problem:  Gabriella went to a pizza parlor and ate 3/4 of a medium cheese pizza. Then she ate 5/8 of a medium pepperoni pizza. How much pizza did Gabriella eat altogether? ×  ",14,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation
15,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation,"The answer to the total amount of pizza eaten resulted from adding 3/4 and 5/8, or increasing 3/4 by 5/8. ",15,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation
16,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation,"We observed many students’ models      and found that many typically use a drawing that supports the context of the problem when first exploring fraction operations based on contexts (see fig. 1). For example, a circle is likely to be used rather than a number line or a set model to solve a problem involving pizza. When looking at a drawing that illustrates adding 3/4 + 5/8, each fraction is first represented from its own whole. For this problem, the whole  for each fraction is 1, or in this case,  1 same-size pizza. In the cheese pizza, each 1/4 piece in the 3/4 is cut in half, so that the eighths are consistent with the pieces in the 5/8, and then they are combined.",16,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation
17,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation,"Students who solve this problem  correctly typically combine the “pizza slices” to make 1 whole pizza with  3/8 of another pizza remaining, or  1 3/8 total pizza. It is important to note that students represent their solution as a mixed number directly rather than writing a fraction greater than 1 as an intermediate step. This is likely the result of the context ",17,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation
18,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation,"We have found We have found that errors occur that errors occur less frequently with less frequently with word problems that word problems that use a clearly deﬁ ned use a clearly deﬁ ned unit, such as a gallon unit, such as a gallon of tea or a yard of fabric, of tea or a yard of fabric, than with a less clearly deﬁ ned than with a less clearly deﬁ ned unit, such as a pizza or a pitcher of tea.",18,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation

If students do not use context to solve the problem but use straight computation, they typically add the numerators to get a fraction greater than 1. They then try to make sense of their answer of 11/8. At this point, language becomes an integral part of making sense of the solution.",19,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation
20,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation,"Understanding wholes for fractions  and defi ning them are diffi cult for students. For example, students may know that the answer is 11/8 but not understand the differences in describing this amount as 11/8 pizzas versus 11/8 of the two pizzas (Lamon 1996; Tobias 2013). In this case, the answer would be either “11/8 of a pizza” or “1 pizza and 3/8 of another pizza.” If the student incorrectly gives “11/8 of the 2 pizzas” as an answer, the student is providing an incorrect answer that describes more than 2 pizzas. This incorrect answer is a result of solving the addition problem in context (Tobias 2009). This error would not be common if the same computation occurred outside of a context.",20,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation
21,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation,Fraction suBtraction,21,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation
22,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation,Similar trends are found when subtracting fractions. Two common  subtraction forms are (1) separate problems and (2) compare problems (Carpenter et al. 1999). Separate problems are often described as “take away” subtraction and include decreasing one amount by another amount. Compare problems involve relating two amounts to each other to determine the amount that is greater. Consider this subtraction problem:,22,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation
23,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation,Research supports the effi cacy  ×   of having students author their own word problems as a way to deepen their understanding of the operations being studied (Alexander and Ambrose 2010; Alibali et al. 2009). We have used this strategy with our students and an interesting common error emerges. ,23,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation
24,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation,"Consider the following separate word problems that students might write to represent the situation.      1.  Darrell has 3/4 of a cheese pizza  leftover from his birthday. He eats 1/2 of the leftover pizza. How much pizza does Darrell have left? 2.  Aubrey had 3/4 of a pizza in a  box. Before she began to eat, her dog ate 1/2 of a pizza right out of the box. How much pizza did Aubrey have left after her dog ate some?",24,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation
25,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation,"Both problems describe a  situation in which an amount is taken out or used, and both use the fractions 3/4 and 1/2. Employ a visual model to solve each problem before proceeding. Do you get the same answer for both situations?",25,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation
26,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation,"Consider the visual model in  fi gure 2a, which is representative of students’ work on problem 1. This particular student started by drawing 3/4 of a circle (probably to represent 3/4 of a cheese pizza leftover from Darrell’s birthday). Next, the student found 1/2 of the 3/4, which is also shown in the fi gure. The student then crossed out the part of the pizza representing 1/2 of the 3/4; 3/8 of a pizza was the correct fi nal answer for the fi rst question.",26,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation
27,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation,"The work to represent problem 2 also started with a circle that was 3/4 shaded (see fi g. 2b). In this problem, the dog ate 1/2 of an entire pizza from what was left so 1/2 of the circle is marked as eaten. After 1/2 of the circle is crossed out, the remaining 1/4 of the circle, or 1/4 of the pizza, is given as the answer and is correct. ",27,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation
28,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation,"Fig. 2 These two fraction problems, in which the result is smaller than the initial amount, require different representations and calculations.

29,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation,"Each student’s solution starts with 3/4 and then an amount is subtracted from that. The first student took away 1/2 of the 3/4 of the pizza, whereas the second student took away 1/2 of an entire pizza. The difference between the methods is what the second fraction in each question refers to. ",29,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation
30,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation,"Which solution makes sense? They  both make sense and are correct for their context, but only the second solution matches the expression  3/4 - 1/2. Problem 1 is represented  by the calculation  not 3/4 - 1/2, as was intended. The reason for this difference is that the second fraction in each question refers to different wholes. This misconception does not emerge when subtracting whole numbers in context or  when subtracting fractions devoid  of context, even when visual images are used.",30,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation
31,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation,   ,31,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation
32,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation,"The common error of believing that problem 1 can be represented  by 3/4 - 1/2 occurs when students are developing an understanding of subtraction as “take away” in context; we have found it helpful to anticipate and address this particular error. Interestingly, from our experiences, the error occurs less frequently with word problems that use a clearly defined unit, such as a gallon of tea or a yard of fabric, than with a less clearly defined unit, such as a pizza or a pitcher of tea. The errors are also limited to occurring with separate problems rather than compare problems.",32,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation
33,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation,"We have observed that using separate problems with a pizza context, for example, highlights the misconception and gives us an opportunity to address and resolve the issue. However, we do so only after considerable discussion, which allows us to work with students to contemplate the idea of the whole in context. We have found that expecting the error and being cognizant of problem types are useful in discussions with students.",33,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation
34,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation,"Presenting word problems to  students and allowing them to create their own strategies using pictures afford an opportunity for conceptual understanding to occur. With addition and subtraction situations, one underlying premise within these two operations is that the amounts represented are from a whole that is the same size. By giving students contextualized situations, they can develop an understanding of this idea because they can discuss actual situations. ",34,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation
35,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation,"For example, students will begin  to make sense of their error using a problem with gallons of iced tea and then go back to the problem with pizza to see if they can sort out their difficulty in keeping the whole consistent. Without context, students may not necessarily understand that the fractions being added or subtracted and the resulting sum or difference are defined by the same size whole. ",35,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation
36,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation,Fraction Multiplication,36,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation
37,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation,"For our discussion with multiplication contexts, we will focus on grouping situations (Carpenter et al. 1999). Grouping involves finding the total when the numbers of groups and the size of each group are known. Describing wholes for fraction multiplication problems is different from adding or subtracting. Addends in an addition problem refer to the same size whole, whereas factors in a multiplication problem do not. Con1 × sider this word problem representing a  grouping situation for    Sue has 3/4 of a pizza leftover. Jim ate 2/3 of the leftover pizza. How much of a whole pizza did Jim eat?    ",37,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation
38,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation,"When defining wholes with multiplication, common convention tells us that the multiplication sign can be interpreted as meaning “of.” With grouping situations, using whole numbers such as 6 × 5 refers to 6 groups of 5. Likewise, if we look at our problem and ask what we are finding a part of, we start with 3/4 and take 2/3 of that amount. To represent the word problem with a model, a student draws 3/4 of a whole and then finds 2/3 of the 3/4, as opposed to drawing 2/3 of a whole and finding 3/4 of the 2/3 (see fig. 3).",38,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation
39,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation,"Although the result is the same, the  visual model is much different. Our students are able to make sense of this difference when they discuss the contexts of the problems rather than when they rely solely on the visual image. We found that our students can imagine Jim eating 2/3 of Sue’s leftover pizza in the problem above more readily than trying to visualize a representation of the problem devoid of context. (Our students have said that they find themselves creating contexts for ",39,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation

42,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation,"We also found that our students  seem to develop a deeper understanding of the operation as they discuss situations that are modeled by  2/3 × 3/4 versus 3/4 × 2/3. This may stem from the fact that when evaluating 3/4 × 2/3, one needs to cut the  2/3 to take 3/4 of that amount. Whereas with 2/3 × 3/4, the pieces are already situated so that it is easy to take 2/3 of 3/4 directly without dividing up the 3/4 further into more and smaller pieces.",42,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation
43,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation,"Finally, the problem specifies that  we are looking for the amount of a whole pizza that Jim ate. (See fig. 3a.) He ate 2/3 of 3/4; if we compare Jim’s amount with the whole pizza, then he ate 1/2 of a pizza because 2 of the  3 fourth-size pieces represent 2/4, or 1/2, of the whole.",43,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation
44,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation,"We started with 3/4, so this representation was in terms of the original whole, which was 1 pizza. Taking 2/3 of that amount meant that we had to find 2/3 of 3/4, making 3/4 the new whole that was now to be used. Finally, to answer the question, the whole changed back to the original whole of pizza, so the answer was 1/2 of a pizza. ",44,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation
45,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation,Similar characteristics can be seen with fraction division situations. ,45,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation
46,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation,Fraction division,46,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation
47,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation,"Two common problem types for division situations are partitive and measurement meanings (Carpenter et al. 1999). With partitive division, we know the total and the number of groups. We seek to determine the amount in each group. With measurement division, we know the total and the amount in each group and seek to determine the number of groups that can be made. It is most common to use contexts supporting measurement division when dividing fractions by fractions because sharing among a part of a group is difficult to visualize (Dixon et al. 2011). Therefore, we will focus on measurement division exclusively.  ×  ",47,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation
48,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation,Consider this measurement division word problem for the following fraction:  There are 1 7/8 pounds of fudge at the candy store. How many  1/4 pound packages can be made from this fudge? What part of another package will be leftover?    ,48,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation
49,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation,"Fig. 4 This visual model, determining how many 1/4 pound servings are possible  from 1 7/8 pounds of chocolate, must consider that the 1/8 pound of leftover fudge is 1/2 of a 1/4 pound serving. ",49,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation
50,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation,"When solving this problem, we  start with the original amount of 1 7/8 pounds and see how many  1/4 pound packages can be made from the 1 7/8 pounds of fudge (see fig. 4). In other words, we are looking to see how many groups of 1/4 pound each can fit into the total of 1 7/8. The solution is the number of groups. ",50,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation
51,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation,"Start with 1 7/8 pounds and section off groups that are 1/4 pound. This illustrates that both fractions are out of the same whole pound. From this, there are seven servings of  1/4 pound each that can be made, with some leftover. This leftover amount is often difficult to describe. Many students will say this fraction represents 1/8 because that amount is 1/8 pound. Students need to understand that this question is asking what part of a 1/4 pound package remains, and the remainder needs to be described based on the package size. The package size becomes the new whole; therefore, the 1/8 pound leftover needs to be recognized as 1/2 of the 1/4 pound package. Thus, the correct answer to this problem is 7 1/2, not 7 1/8. The context of the problem leads to the correct interpretation of the whole.",51,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation
52,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation,"In early work with division using whole numbers, students are asked to find a remainder in terms of a whole number. For example, if solving 9 ÷ 4, the solution of 2 remainder 1 is written as 2 R1. When students move to fraction situations, they must coordinate what part of another group remains, rather than just describing what remains in terms of the original whole. Instead of writing the solution as 2 R1, this answer becomes 2 1/4 because students are looking for groups of 4; in other words, 4 becomes the new whole.",52,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation

54,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation,"When students move to fraction division, the remainder is found in a similar way by referring to how much of another group they are seeking.

55,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation,Our students rely on the context of the problem even more than the visual image to convince themselves that the answer is 7 1/2 rather than 7 1/8 as they describe how much of another package they can make.,55,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation
56,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation,Mitigating errors,56,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation
57,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation,"Working with word problems provides an opportunity for students to develop an understanding of what each number represents. By being exposed to various contexts for operations, our students used their previous knowledge of whole numbers to make sense of working with these same types of situations with fractions. Using procedures alone in computing with decontextualized problems results in a well-documented set of errors as illustrated through the example of the thinking of the student shared at the start of this article. On the other hand, using visual models to solve problems provided in context can result in another set of errors related to incorrectly defining the whole. We have found that the key is to anticipate these errors and use them as springboards to learning. This allowed our students to make connections in mathematics and develop an understanding of what it means to operate with fractions. ",57,The Whole Story: Understanding Fraction Computation
