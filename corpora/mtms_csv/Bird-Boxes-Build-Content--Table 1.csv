11,Bird Boxes Build Content Area Knowledge,"Content Standards (2000), the nesting box task requires that students use abstract reasoning, construct viable arguments, critique the reasoning of others, and develop models by applying known and inferred mathematics. The activity also requires a shift in perspectives; the accurate use of rulers, compasses, and graph paper; and the ability to communicate with clear defi nitions. In short, the task addresses the Mathematical Practices found in CCSSM (Ball and Forzani 2011). Before describing the details of the nesting box task, I will explain what led to the creation of this housing project.",11,Bird Boxes Build Content Area Knowledge
12,Bird Boxes Build Content Area Knowledge,"I found that the preservice teachers in my methods course lacked pedagogical content knowledge (the knowledge itself and effective  ways to teach it) (e.g., Ball, Thames, and Phelps 2008). I was concerned that the absence of deep and fl exible understanding of mathematics would translate into little competence for teaching content with meaning. Teachers with weak pedagogical content knowledge fail to plan meaningful lessons or anticipate areas where students might struggle; they are unprepared to answer students’ questions or detect students’ misconceptions; and, inevitably, their students acquire distorted meanings (Ball 2011).  a research stUdy",12,Bird Boxes Build Content Area Knowledge
13,Bird Boxes Build Content Area Knowledge,"In response to preservice teachers’ weak understanding of subject matter knowledge (SMK), I conducted a study to explore the impact that a nesting box activity would have on participants’ geometric SMK. Dur- ing the study, teacher candidates drew two sets of diagrams: one before and one after an intervention. During the intervention, candidates evaluated student work. A university professor of geometry and I discussed how to measure the geometric SMK inherent in the task. We felt that the work of Chapin and Johnson (2006), van Garderen and Montague (2003), and Edens and Potter (2008) validates the premise that geometric reasoning, spatial sense, visualization, and the application of measurement principles might be assessed by analyzing one’s ability to translate numerical information into schematic or isometric drawings. Simply put, translating numbers into drawings signifi es the level of understanding.

(a) Failed to match the floor   piece with side pieces (d) incorrectly cut square-shaped  hole from the floor to the  center of the circular hole (e) incorrect measurement of  slanted roof with sides, front,  and back all the same height (b) Misinterpreted diameter   as describing a diamond  shape rather than a circle (c) incorrectly placed entryway   at the bottom of the box (f) Failure to account for   the triangular pieces  under the peaked roof (g) Failure to match diagram  pieces to make a workable model “wood” needed, and the size of the triangular pieces in the front and back panels under the roof.

82,Bird Boxes Build Content Area Knowledge,"The nesting box task integrates  across mathematical domains (number and operations, algebraic thinking, measurement, and geometry) and across subject areas (ornithology, the scientific study of birds; flight, geography, migration; state birds; art; music; and carpentry). The task might be extended by making cardboard-model prototypes for the construction of wood nesting boxes to attract birds to homes and school grounds. Preservice teachers can take these idea with them into student teaching placements and future classrooms. Other ideas will likely emerge as middle school mathematics teachers incorporate the nesting box activity in their classrooms and communities. ",82,Bird Boxes Build Content Area Knowledge
