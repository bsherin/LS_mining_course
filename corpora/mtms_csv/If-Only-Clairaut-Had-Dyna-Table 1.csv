2,If Only Clairaut Had Dynamic Geometry Tools,"Hyewon Chang and Barbara J. Reys ggGeometry is a major area of study in  middle school mathematics, although it typically receives far less attention than topics such as algebra and rational numbers. In fact, middle school and secondary students have diffi culty learning important geometric concepts although these concepts are a much more visible part of their daily lives than algebra. Some conjecture that students experience diffi culty learning school geometry and connecting it to everyday geometry because of the premature focus on rigorous and formal proof before meaningful conceptualization of key ideas (Battista 2009).

These statements refl ect the need to develop a conceptual foundation based on exploration, discovery, and explanation prior to an emphasis on formal proof. The activity described below supports these goals. ",4,If Only Clairaut Had Dynamic Geometry Tools
5,If Only Clairaut Had Dynamic Geometry Tools,"We consider two opportunities for  increasing the conceptual focus on geometry in the middle grades. One is to rethink how to introduce and develop concepts of school geometry. In particular, we consider Clairaut’s approach that emphasizes engaging student curiosity about key ideas and theorems instead of directly teaching theorems before their application in real life. The second related opportunity is use of computer technology that enables and promotes student exploration and engagement. ",5,If Only Clairaut Had Dynamic Geometry Tools

8,If Only Clairaut Had Dynamic Geometry Tools,"Clairaut, a famous eighteenth-century French mathematician and astronomer, prepared a geometry text that drew on what he called the natural human thought process. His approach is characterized by combining logical and intuitive elements, instead of building elements of geometry on a purely logical basis. In fact, Clairaut criticized Euclid’s logico-deductive approach, which he felt made learning diffi cult because of its dull and boring development.",8,If Only Clairaut Had Dynamic Geometry Tools
9,If Only Clairaut Had Dynamic Geometry Tools,"Clairaut was also critical of an  alternative that addressed the limitation of Euclid’s approach by including applications following formal work on theorems. Instead, Clairaut drew on the historic-genetic principle, which dated from the seventeenth century and recognized that discoverers themselves were beginners in the history of mathematics. He theorized that the discoverers’ trajectory of development—initiated by a particular need and formalized gradually—might also be benefi cial to later generations of beginning learners. The result was his masterpiece Elémens de Géométrie, published in 1741.",9,If Only Clairaut Had Dynamic Geometry Tools
10,If Only Clairaut Had Dynamic Geometry Tools,"Clairaut’s approach to geometry instruction can be characterized by two principles: practical necessity and intuition-driven. It is in contrast to Euclid’s rigorous approach, which moves toward formalization before learners are necessarily motivated by a need to know. Euclid’s method starts with defi nitions, axioms, and postulates that often do not excite  or engage the average learner. On the other hand, Clairaut begins with practical necessity, mimicking the motivation of the inventors of geometry, as the fi rst step in exploring an idea. Clairaut’s approach does not insist on rigorous exactness of mathematical proof. Rather, justifi cation is intuitive and used only when necessary.",10,If Only Clairaut Had Dynamic Geometry Tools
11,If Only Clairaut Had Dynamic Geometry Tools,"Although Clairaut acknowledged  criticism that his approach relied too much on the testimony of the eyes and neglected the strictness of demonstration, he defended the approach. He argued that the focus for beginners should be on big ideas, not propositions whose truth may be discovered by the smallest degree of attention. For example, consider these statements: •  “In any triangle, the greater  side subtends the great angle.” •  “A circle does not cut another  circle at more than two points.”  •  “If two circles touch one another, then they will not have the same center.”",11,If Only Clairaut Had Dynamic Geometry Tools
12,If Only Clairaut Had Dynamic Geometry Tools,"Although Euclid labored to demonstrate these ideas, Clairaut thought trivial propositions such as these did not warrant students’ attention by a strict demonstration.

13,If Only Clairaut Had Dynamic Geometry Tools,"Clairaut’s ideas are particularly  appropriate for middle school mathematics where formalization is not the goal. As an example of Clairaut’s  theory, we consider the idea that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is constant. Unfortunately, most students are not curious about this idea and are not given the opportunity to discover it. According to Clairaut’s method, teachers can support student engagement by asking them to consider ideas and to investigate their truth. For example, the teacher might pose the following challenge to students:",13,If Only Clairaut Had Dynamic Geometry Tools

Today, we can use his theory via a dynamic environment aided by technology. In other words, thanks to the instruments of technology, his method can be reborn.

Teachers establish the classroom environment that allows student exploration to flourish. In addition, it is important to identify and create the scenarios under which students can and will explore important ideas. Also crucial is considering when technological tools are more efficient than paper-and-pencil exploration and for which ideas. Teachers orchestrate and monitor the flow of student ideas, prompting students to, for example, recognize invariants.
