"The Editorial Panel is presenting the following problem to stimulate submissions to “The Thinking of Students” department. We encourage teachers to try this problem with students and analyze the different ways that students solve it. Feel free to photocopy this problem for use in your classroom. Please send the following if students generate unique strategies:  •  A brief analysis of the   specific strategy •  Examples of students’ work •   Your name, the school name  and address, and    your e-mail address",2,mtms2008-08-31a,,

"Farmer Brown had three pens, each with the same number of animals. Pen A held cows, pen B held sheep, and pen C held pigs. One day, his careless nephew released all the animals from their pens. The farmer rushed to get the animals in any pen. Each pen now held a mixed group of cows, sheep, and pigs. He noticed the following when counting the animals: •  Each pen held the same number of animals as it did  before the animals were released.",5,mtms2008-08-31a,,
•  The number of pigs in pen A was the same as the  number of pigs in pen B.,6,mtms2008-08-31a,,
•  The number of sheep in pen A was the same as the  number of sheep in pen C.,7,mtms2008-08-31a,,
•  The number of sheep in pen A was 2/3 the number of  pigs in pen A.,8,mtms2008-08-31a,,
How does the number of cows in pen B compare with the number of cows in pen C? solution to august’s  “solve it” (Continued from page 31),9,mtms2008-08-31a,,
"The number of cows in pen C is four times the number of cows in pen B. There are multiple ways to solve this problem, including by example and algebraically, as shown below. ",10,mtms2008-08-31a,,
The first condition indicates that the number of animals in each pen was the same before and after the animals escaped. Let variables represent the number of animals in each pen. The variable will be the same value before and after the animals escaped. Let A represent the number of animals in each pen. ,11,mtms2008-08-31a,,
"The second condition indicates that the number of pigs in pen A is the same as the number of pigs in pen B. Since these numbers are equal, let one variable represent both values. Let x represent both the number of pigs in pen A and in pen B.",12,mtms2008-08-31a,,
"Similarly, since the number of sheep in pen A is the same as the number of sheep in pen C, use the same expression to represent each value. From the fourth condition, the number of sheep in pen A is 2/3 the number of pigs in pen A; the number of sheep in pen A and pen C can each be expressed by (2/3)x. Table 1 lists  table 1 The animals after they escaped",13,mtms2008-08-31a,,

"There are (2/3)x sheep in pen A  and (2/3)x sheep in pen C. Originally, there were A sheep in pen B. This means that there are A –  (2/3)x – (2/3)x, or A – (4/3)x, sheep still in pen B. There are x pigs in pen A and x pigs in pen B. Originally, there were A pigs in pen C. This means that there are A – x – x, or A – 2x, pigs in pen C. See table 2 for these updates. We know how many sheep and pigs are in each pen, and we know the total animals in each pen. We can find the number of cows in each pen by subtracting the number of both sheep and pigs from the original number of animals in the pen.",22,mtms2008-08-31a,,
"By examining pen B, we know that the number of animals is A. The number of sheep in the pen is A – (4/3)x, and the number of pigs is x. So the number of cows in pen B is  A – (A – (4/3)x) – x, or (1/3)x. ",23,mtms2008-08-31a,,
"In pen C, the number of animals  is A; the number of pigs is A – 2x, and the number of sheep is (2/3)x. So the number of cows in pen C is A –  (A – 2x) – (2/3)x, or (4/3)x.",24,mtms2008-08-31a,,
"This means that the number of  cows in pen C, (4/3)x, is four times the number of cows in pen B, (1/3)x. ●",25,mtms2008-08-31a,,
