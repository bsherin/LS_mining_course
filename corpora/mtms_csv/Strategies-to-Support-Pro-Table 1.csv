1,Strategies to Support Productive Struggle - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"As students struggle over a mathematical task, teachers can often hear some students utter, “I don’t get it” or “I don’t know what to do.” Some may even proclaim, “I know the answer, I just don’t know how to explain it.” As teachers, we want to help our students address their struggles and recognize that there are choices in how we respond. The kind of struggle referred to here is described by Hiebert and Grouws (2007) in this way: “Students expend effort in order to make sense of mathematics, to figure something out that is not immediately apparent” (p. 387).",,
2,Strategies to Support Productive Struggle - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,The Rain Barrel problem in figure 1 was a task designed and implemented in a research study that investigated students’ struggle in middle school mathematics classrooms (Warshauer 2014).,,
3,Strategies to Support Productive Struggle - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In one classroom episode, Sandy, a student in Ms. Hill’s class, had difficulty getting started with the problem. The following interaction occurred:",,
4,Strategies to Support Productive Struggle - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"This series of teacher questioning alters a challenging problem, requiring students to think and reason deeply into a procedural problem structured by the teacher. Although this interaction moves this student toward the answer, the student’s work is reduced to numerical manipulations.",,
5,Strategies to Support Productive Struggle - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"An episode, however, in which students encounter difficulty while working on a challenging task can be viewed as an opportunity for them to grapple with important mathematical ideas. Teachers can use these instances to acknowledge struggle as a natural part of learning while providing appropriate guidance and support to maintain the mathematical goals and cognitive demand of the task (Smith 2000). Research suggests that a range of teacher support and responses are possible in episodes of student struggles to advance students productively toward a resolution of understanding (Warshauer 2014). Hiebert and Stigler add that such support and guidance “provide students with opportunities to think more deeply about mathematical concepts”  (2004, p. 13).",,
6,Strategies to Support Productive Struggle - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,A STRUGGLE INTERACTION:  ONE EXAMPLE,,
7,Strategies to Support Productive Struggle - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Ms. George, a seventh-grade teacher, was one participant in the research study who implemented the Rain Barrel problem. She asked her students to work on the problem individually for about five minutes. When she noticed that most of the students had worked on it to completion, she asked them to share their work with their small group of three to four students.",,
8,Strategies to Support Productive Struggle - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"She walked around the room, listening or asking questions. She came to Drew, one of the students in a small group. The following episode illustrates four strategies used by the teacher that we identified as productively supporting a student’s struggle as a natural course of sense making and mathematical effort.",,
9,Strategies to Support Productive Struggle - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Strategy 1: Teachers ask questions that help students focus on their thinking and identify the source of their struggle. They encourage students to build on their thinking or look at other ways to approach the problem without solving the problem for them.,,
10,Strategies to Support Productive Struggle - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,The teacher began by asking Drew questions and giving him an opportunity to explain his solution.,,
11,Strategies to Support Productive Struggle - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Drew wavered with uncertainty in his explanation. He seemed to be basing his thinking on a misconception that removing an equal quantity would not affect the comparative fullness even if the sizes of the containers were different. While the teacher listened to Drew’s attempt to explain, she asked him questions, first to have him clarify and make public his thinking, then to mathematically justify his claim on his paper.",,
12,Strategies to Support Productive Struggle - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Strategy 2: Teachers encourage their students to reflect on their work and support student struggle in their effort to explain their thinking and not just in getting correct answers.,,
13,Strategies to Support Productive Struggle - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,The teacher provided encouragement while Drew struggled with his uncertainty. She also restated Drew’s justification without passing judgment and gave him an opportunity to share his thinking.,,
14,Strategies to Support Productive Struggle - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Strategy 3: Teachers give time and help students manage their struggles through adversity and failure by not stepping in too soon or helping too much and thus taking the intellectual work away from the students.,,
15,Strategies to Support Productive Struggle - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"George suggested that doing mathematics takes time, patience, and perseverance as she asked Drew to keep working and to write down his explanation as she left to respond to other students. Drew remained engaged as he persisted with his task, even asking his nearby classmates for quiet as he worked for approximately thirty seconds. This episode illustrated the teacher providing time for the student to keep working.",,
16,Strategies to Support Productive Struggle - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Strategy 4: Teachers acknowledge that struggle is an important and natural part of learning and doing mathematics.,,
17,Strategies to Support Productive Struggle - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The teacher acknowledged that the effort Drew expended was something she valued. Drew now had a mathematical way to document his work, and he appeared more confident in the conclusion he had reached.",,
18,Strategies to Support Productive Struggle - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,SUPPORTING STUDENTS’ STRUGGLE,,
19,Strategies to Support Productive Struggle - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Studies suggest that struggling to make sense of mathematics is a necessary component of learning mathematics with understanding (Hiebert and Grouws 2007). Hiebert and Wearne stated that “all students need to struggle with challenging problems if they are to learn mathematics deeply” (1993, p.6). In the recent NCTM publication Principles to Actions: Ensuring Mathematical Success for All (2014), the writing team identified the support of productive struggle in learning mathematics as one of the eight important teaching practices.",,
20,Strategies to Support Productive Struggle - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In the moment-by-moment needs of the students in their struggle, the responses that teachers give may in one instance enhance and in other instances diminish the level of student learning. This often depends on the circumstances, including the goals of the task, the student’s prior knowledge, and the student’s willingness to attempt to do the problem. Teachers can incorporate into their practice explicit reminders to students that struggling to make sense of mathematics is an important and natural part of learning. Rather than avoiding this phenomenon, teachers can integrate struggle as part of doing mathematics by acknowledging students’ consternation, encouraging perseverance, asking questions, and offering time to work through problems. Figure 2 outlines teaching strategies that remind students of the positive aspects of struggle and student actions that indicate productive engagement toward a resolution.",,
21,Strategies to Support Productive Struggle - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In summary, when students appear confused, unable to make sense of an answer, or reach an impasse in working on their task, teachers can view these episodes not as impediments to learning but as an opportunity for deepening students’ understanding of mathematics. Teaching must be adaptive and situated in the interaction that unfolds from the task activity. By incorporating instructional approaches that acknowledge student struggles and effectively support and guide the students’ thinking toward a productive resolution, students are given opportunities to strengthen their disposition toward engaging in challenging tasks. Over time, they will persist through their effort to make sense of and understand important mathematics.",,
