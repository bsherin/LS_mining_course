Emotion and Thought,1,mtms2007-05-522a,,
That emotions can both facilitate learning and block learning is an accepted psychological fact. The author considers those factors that he feels develop an optimal learning situation in the classroom.,2,mtms2007-05-522a,,
"I f I MAy SpEAk Of THE HuMAN MIND, SOMEwhat roughly, as a computing machine, then it is certainly a machine which is formidably intricate and incredibly delicate. Moreover, and this is the point which I wish to discuss, it is devastatingly subject to the influence of the emotions. The teacher who is trying to improve the problem-solving ability of a student is consequently involved in the manipulation of an awesome piece of machinery. The result of this manipulation may range all the way from permanent  improvement  to  permanent  damage.  The matter  is  worth  discussing  largely  because  it  lies within our ability to secure a maximum of improvement and a minimum of damage, provided we know how to go about it. But it is not always done the way one might expect. Goals like accuracy and precision must be approached with some caution; under certain  circumstances  they  can  become,  surprisingly, not the desirable things we usually think them, but rather  obstacles  and  sources  of  difficulty.

"A  word  on  the  editorial  approach  to  reprinted  articles: Obvious  typographical  errors  have  been  silently  corrected. Additions to the text for purposes of clarification appear in brackets. No effort has been made to reproduce the layouts or designs of the original articles, although the subheads are those that first appeared with the text. The use of words and phrases now considered outmoded, even slightly jarring to modern sensibilities, has likewise been maintained in an effort to give the reader a better feel for the era in which the articles were written.—Ed.",5,mtms2007-05-522a,,
"curs chiefly when these goals are overstressed, or when  they  are  used  as  the  vehicle  for  expressing such emotions as resentment or hostility.",6,mtms2007-05-522a,,
"1.  The  subtlety  of  emotional  influences.  Recently I  was  working  to  generalize  a  theorem  I  had  just proved. I found myself not really trying. I was not really trying because I suspected that no improvement was possible. probably, also, I was not really trying because I wanted to be done with the matter, give the existing version to the typist, and get on with something else. finding an improvement would force me to alter everything that had been written.",7,mtms2007-05-522a,,
"I did, finally, establish the extended version of the theorem. But this became possible only after I had settled three preliminary matters: first, I had to recognize that I was not really trying.",8,mtms2007-05-522a,,
"Second, I had to make myself believe in the possibility of success.",9,mtms2007-05-522a,,
"finally,  I  had  to  persuade  myself  that  the  improved version was worth striving for, that it really was something I wanted.",10,mtms2007-05-522a,,
"This influence of the emotions on one’s rational thought processes—especially as it appears in students—is  a  central  problem  of  good  teaching.  As a sheer guess, we might estimate that the teacher is well advised to devote one-tenth of his effort to the objective presentation of material (which should be an easy task for him, anyway, if he is well qualified), and to spend the remaining nine-tenths in establishing a suitable emotional background for the student’s  efforts.  Obviously,  not  everyone  would agree with this estimate, but I think there is much evidence to support it.",11,mtms2007-05-522a,,
"The teacher who is to be cognizant of emotional influences  must  possess,  among  other  qualifications,  these  two:  He  must  be  able  to  perceive  the student’s needs, and he must be able to adjust his own behavior in response to these needs. In doing this, the teacher’s chief obstacle is the large heritage of attitudes which are inappropriate to the situation. On the other hand, his chief asset is his understanding of his own mental processes and feelings and his knowledge of what works well in his own case.",12,mtms2007-05-522a,,
"The important influences in the teacher-student relation  are  very  small  things:  an  inflection  in  the voice  at  the  end  of  a  question,  or  perhaps  even  a glance, with no words spoken. We must be careful not  to  become  so  concerned  with  the  gross,  macroscopic phenomena that we overlook the nuances. Which  teachers  terrified  us,  when  we  ourselves were students? Did it depend upon what they actually said, or upon the way that they said it? Or even upon the way that they acted and looked, when they weren’t speaking at all?",13,mtms2007-05-522a,,
"As a further example of the sort of thing we are dealing with, it is worth noticing how many different matters are involved in “wanting to learn”: wanting to win the teacher’s approval, wanting to avoid punishment, wanting to stand on one’s own feet without the teacher’s help, wanting to be able to defend one’s own ideas against any criticisms of the teacher’s, wanting to  develop  self-confidence,  wanting  to  contribute  a new idea, and many other things. I might add: wanting to satisfy one’s own sense of what is right. The diversity and depth of these phenomena is never exhausted, however long and carefully the teacher may observe the student’s motives. He who is not alive to the subtleties of student desires and student motivation—indeed, he who is not thrilled and intrigued by them—has little likelihood of being a good teacher. But the phenomena are of the greatest subtlety, and many teachers find them easy to overlook. He who thinks  of  motivation  as  rooted  in  good  grades  and later earning power is a poor observer indeed.",14,mtms2007-05-522a,,
"2. Student needs and teacher attitudes. perhaps we should consider a few typical needs of students, and a few of the attitudes that frequently appear as obstacles to the teacher. This is no easy matter. It is this very subtlety of the phenomena which confounds us. The inter-relations between two people consist of a perfectly evident verbal part, and of a nonverbal part that is not at all evident. unfortunately, the “invisible” nonverbal part is usually the more decisive. However much we dislike someone, it is not at all easy to say exactly why we dislike him. If we are strongly attracted to some other person, it is not to be explained, ordinarily, on the basis of something he has said, but  rather because of something he has communicated without using the literal meaning of words.",15,mtms2007-05-522a,,
"Let us give an example. In the final scene of the recent movie version of Herman Wouk’s Caine Mutiny, the captain and a young officer named keith are standing  on  the  bridge  of  a  minesweeper,  about  to take her out to sea. keith has been distinctly arrogant, and remarkably incompetent, in his past performances. As if this were not enough, he has made matters considerably worse by voicing a dislike for the captain, and by becoming involved in a mutiny. keith, in short, is a problem. Now for the scene on the bridge: it is simple in the extreme. The captain looks at keith. “keith,” he says, and pauses for a memorable piece of nonverbal communication, “take her out!”",16,mtms2007-05-522a,,
"By facial expressions, by tone of voice, by whatever other subtle mannerisms—as well as by the act itself of entrusting the ship’s safety to keith—the captain has said, in effect: “Go ahead. you will find yourself. If you try to take the ship out, nothing terrible will happen. I trust you; you can afford to trust yourself a bit.” undoubtedly, any exceptional nervousness on the part of the captain would have been communicated to keith and would surely have impaired his performance. Any insincerity, ambivalence, resentment, or similar feeling would also have been communicated. Each  of  us  has  everyday  experiences  which  demonstrate how easy it is to “get rattled”—often in response to someone else’s anxiety. The teacher’s feelings are likewise transmitted to the student, and have the strongest influence on how well he likes a subject, how hard he works in it, the quality of the work, and his use of the subject in years to come. This last point alone would suffice to direct a great deal of attention to  the  communication  of  attitudes  between  teacher and student. After all, in later life, the student can go out of his way to make use of a certain subject, or he can go out of his way to avoid it; if he does use it, he can do so creatively, or he can do so in a thoroughly routine way. Much of this is determined by minute nuances experienced in the classroom.",17,mtms2007-05-522a,,
"In one of my own classes I recently had a student who presented a picture rather like keith. I am sure this student disliked teachers. He had accumulated a long record of failures in mathematics. I believe he found the subject incomprehensible. His own ideas of what was important within a problem had, I suspect, never seemed to coincide with the ideas of his teachers. (Incidentally, I might add that the teacher who is not able to explain his ideas so that the student willingly accepts them, and understands them, but who is nonetheless prepared to insist upon these ideas,  is  one  of  the  major  sources  of  resentments and feelings of inadequacy among mathematics students.) He appeared to be left with the feeling that it ",18,mtms2007-05-522a,,
"VOL. 12, NO. 9  .  MAy 2007   523 was impossible ever to please the teacher, that mathematics was a magical subject where any reasonable decision would later turn out to be wrong, for some reason of the most unpredictable sort. It doubtless seemed to him to defy understanding. Mathematics looked to him like a combination of witchcraft and the capricious misuse of authority.",19,mtms2007-05-522a,,
"Toward the end of the term he began to work diligently, if somewhat uncomprehendingly. I take some credit for this spurt of activity. I imagine I had made him feel that success was a more real possibility than he had formerly thought it to be. On one occasion he volunteered to go to the board and solve a problem. This already indicated a great increase in his belief that “nothing terrible would happen.” By this I refer especially to the nonverbal relations between him, the class, and me. The achievement which I claim for myself is that I had made him feel, after a term’s contact, that my attitude toward him would continue to  be  friendly  and  encouraging,  whatever  came  of his efforts at the blackboard. This, of course, was a nonverbal matter. It makes little difference what the teacher says; the crucial thing is his manner.",20,mtms2007-05-522a,,
told  him ,21,mtms2007-05-522a,,
"When  this  student  went  to  the  board,  he  was noticeably  anxious.  He  worked  most  of  a  difficult problem with fair accuracy (getting almost the right answer), though he omitted some parentheses and made a few similar errors. When he had finished, I that  I thought he had used a  lot  of  good  ideas (which  was  entirely the  truth,  and  may consequently have sounded sincere). Then  I  asked  him, without specification, if  he  had  written  exactly what he had intended in each of the lines  of  work.  With no  further  comment from  me,  he  turned and  corrected  most of his minor errors.",22,mtms2007-05-522a,,
"He who is not alive to the subtleties of student desires and student motivation— indeed, he who is not thrilled and intrigued by them—has little likelihood of being a good teacher",23,mtms2007-05-522a,,
"This  is  in  many ways the crux of the matter. By building self-confidence, by pointing out the positive paths to achievement, by encouraging faith  in  the  possibility  of  success,  we  do  the  optimal job of teaching. What we really have to do is to show each student that something he wants can be achieved by his own efforts in a certain direction. The use of negative inducements, threats, intimidation, or  ridicule  is  a  more  dangerous  and  far  less  satisfactory approach. Veiled threats are no better. The  trouble  with  inhibitions,  as  everyone  today  seems to know, is that they have an alarming tendency to spread. If we say “don’t” to someone often enough, he  soon  becomes  unable  even  to  do  those  things which  are  permissible.  (One  encounters  students of piano who have been told so frequently, and with such convincing feeling, not to make noise and disturb the rest of the family, that this has finally become a factor in their striking wrong notes during a performance. After all, music is a communication between performer and hearer, and if the hearer has habitually interpreted it as a hostile communication the player may gradually come to accept this evaluation,  and  to  develop  the  guilt  feelings  which  one would  then  expect.)  In  mathematics,  I  have  seen students reject a simple and satisfactory solution to a problem, because they have acquired the feeling that things just are not that easy. Anything that nice must be immoral!",24,mtms2007-05-522a,,
"I can summarize the question of student needs by saying that the student does need someone to point out the paths to satisfaction; he does not need someone  to  stand  by  and  threaten  or  intimidate.  Every human being is trying, in a profound sense, to do his best. We can be most helpful by keeping open at least some paths to satisfaction, by showing that these paths are a real answer to his needs and desires, and by not confronting the student with desperate and unsolvable dilemmas.",25,mtms2007-05-522a,,
"3.  Attitudes  which  are  obstacles.  Many  teachers overemphasize  the  demands  of  accuracy  and  precision. They can make a misplaced minus sign appear as the epitome of total failure. They can create a state of anxiety in the student, until he is unable to approach any problem in mathematics without a terrifying sensation of tottering insecurely at the brink of a bottomless pit of absolute incompetence (not to mention ridicule) into which he may at any instant be pushed by the fatal error of misplacing a decimal point. I do not mean to counsel indifference to the need of obtaining a correct answer. The point is that one is more likely to get the right answer when one is relaxed and self-confident than when one is anxious and insecure.",26,mtms2007-05-522a,,
"In the hope of making these ideas more concrete, I should like to refer to a recent article by Catherine Meehan.1 This article gives something of a converse to the point of view which I am describing. Her point of  view  is  that,  by  presenting  mathematical  techniques,  the  teacher  influences  the  attitudes  of  the student.  Our  present  interest  is  in  the  converse: the attitudes of the teacher are communicated in a subtle, nonverbal way to the student, and give rise to certain definite attitudes in the student which have a decisive influence on his problem-solving ability. I  should like to join Miss Meehan in emphasizing that the flexibility or dogmatic rigidity of the graduate, his  creative  zeal  or  his  apathy,  his  responsiveness to new ideas or his rejection of them, all date back in large part to his student days, to the subtle examples set by the attitudes of various teachers.",27,mtms2007-05-522a,,
"Miss Meehan writes: . . . we meet local employers, day after day, who beg us to teach attitudes, good old-fashioned attitudes. If this could be done by means of another course, someone would have tried it before now. It used to be done in the regular classroom. It is still being done in mathematics classes led by alert, enthusiastic, well-prepared teachers. . . .2 ",28,mtms2007-05-522a,,
I hope that I may be forgiven my use of a couple of excerpts as a springboard to plunge into my own remarks. In regard to this first quotation we might emphasize these points.,29,mtms2007-05-522a,,
"1. Attitudes certainly are taught by countless little experiences, all day long, in class and out. This is the very aspect of education which we wish to emphasize. A teacher who counsels self-confidence in all of the big things, but who induces diffidence in all of the little things, will have a harmful effect in the long run. perhaps, for example, he is inclined to interrupt impolitely at times when the student is talking, implying a real lack of respect for the student’s presentation—perhaps also for the student.",30,mtms2007-05-522a,,
"2. The potentialities for inducing good attitudes or bad are tremendous. Many adults possess excellent thought processes which they owe, in part, to certain of their teachers. Alternatively, many adult cases of anti-intellectualism, lack of self-confidence, over-expression  (or  over-inhibition)  of  hostility, distaste  for  certain  subjects,  or  failure  to  appreciate abstract thought can be traced back to teachers who  have  been  instrumental  in  establishing  such patterns. As an example, we might cite the case of the teacher who always insists upon being right, and who may thereby create in students a “what-does-itget-you” attitude toward logic and rationality. Logic may appear as an inadequate defense against the capricious authority of the teacher. The good teacher always tries to make it clear whether he is stating his opinion, or is dealing with objective fact. As much as possible, he guarantees the student a secure refuge in  logic.  Contrariwise,  I  have  heard  poor  teachers brush  aside  the  student’s  logic  even  when  it  was largely correct. One might say: in a good school, a freshman with a rational line of reasoning will prevail over a dean who cannot thus support his conclusions. In a poor school, the dean is always right. What place has logic in such a school? 3.  As  we  have  mentioned  earlier,  it  is  not  what  you do, but the way that you do it. The attitudes of the teacher are decisive, for it is these which influence  the  attitudes  of  the  student.  The  question  is not, for example, whether the teacher tries to state the need for logic, but rather whether the teacher himself trusts his own logic, and genuinely believes in  the  student’s  ability  to  be logical.  If  the  teacher  is  overcontrolling,  and  interferes  too  much  in  the  student’s  thought processes,  the  student  has  no opportunity to develop his own logical  facility.  That  the  over- controlling  teacher  makes speeches  extolling logical thought means little if he continually interferes, as some teachers do, in all of the student’s attempts to think for him.",31,mtms2007-05-522a,,
"Attitudes  certainly are taught by countless little experiences, all day long, in class and out permit  me  to  interrupt  my- self. It occurs to me that I may not be understood, because the reader may be saying to himself: “But, after all, isn’t the internal logic the important thing?” yes, of course. That is to say, it is the important thing to the mathematical structure itself; it is the important thing once it is all set down on paper. But there is a stage, or even many stages, prior to that. One must select strategies, or lines of attack. One must recall this, and see the possibility of using that. In later life, one much choose between various problems, and decide which are feasible and which are not. If a line of attack is not leading to success, one must choose between abandoning it or persevering, and  extreme  error  in  this  direction  is  not  uncommon; often people have long continued attempts in a hopeless direction, or have left an approach just short of victory. One must decide when to resort to a search of the literature, and when to figure the matter out for oneself. Often there are many different types of solution, and one must decide which type to look for, as in choosing between finding a primitive function  in  integration,  or  resorting  to  numerical methods. for the student, who has not yet achieved such  a  high  level  of  integration  of  his  knowledge, there  is  often  the  choice  of  whether  to  use  the method learned in trigonometry, and when to use the method learned in analytic geometry. One must sometimes decide either to try a certain change of variable, or else to reject it as unlikely. One can give literally  millions  of  examples;  indeed,  one  cannot solve even the simplest trigonometric identity without making many choices of this sort. I believe this is one of the functions of inspiration in teaching—to provide  insight  into  how  to  make  these  decisions. This is done chiefly by the example of the teacher, ",32,mtms2007-05-522a,,
"VOL. 12, NO. 9  .  MAy 2007   525 and is one reason why I believe that it is virtually impossible  to  teach  mathematics  unless  one  is  really extremely proficient in the subject. I know many teachers who are a few pages ahead of the students in the textbook, and who are known for the clarity of their lectures and are considered adequate teachers. I feel they are not. They are usually incapable of showing the student the important example of a man who knows how to make all of these choices, and without this, teaching is meaningless.",33,mtms2007-05-522a,,
"The reader may further ask: “Still, isn’t student performance a question of aptitude or ability? If the student hasn’t got what it takes, what is the teacher to  do  then?”  Well,  there  is  no  doubt  that  there  is such a thing as ability, or aptitude, or intelligence, just  as  there  is  such  a  thing  as  body  weight.  But just like body weight, this is relatively constant just so long as we do not make any intelligent effort to change it. The student’s aptitude in a subject is the historical summation of his experiences relating to that subject. It is not even necessary to argue over the question of heredity. There is so much plasticity and potentiality for change in virtually every student that hereditary differences, even if they do exist, are not ordinarily the decisive factor. Heredity, or aptitude, or intelligence is usually neither more nor less than the excuse which the teacher offers when he has failed to understand the needs of a certain student or has been unable to meet these needs. Most “student” failures can be traced back to some adult, often a teacher though not always the current teacher.  Sometimes  one  must  look  to  the  teacher  of  an earlier course who has left a residue of distaste, lack of self-confidence, indecision, and anxiety.",34,mtms2007-05-522a,,
"But after all, how can I say to the teacher: This is  your  job;  look  to  it!  Many  good  teachers  have recognized this as their job, as far back as we know the history of teaching. To teach is to inspire. Many teachers (whom I unhesitatingly label inadequate) say: No, it is not my job. My job is to present material; if the student can get it, well and good. But if he fails, do not blame the failure on me.",35,mtms2007-05-522a,,
"And I would be the first to agree that it is not an individual matter. The cumulative effect of previous teachers may be more than one can counteract. It is precisely for this reason that the criteria of teaching are  so  complex.  A  teacher  may  say  he  has  taught successfully this way for years; ah, but what sort of problem has he been leaving for the teachers who had to deal with these students in following years? Did he teach the students to think for themselves? Did he teach them to like the subject, and to want to work hard in it? Did he teach them to approach problems with self-confidence? Or perhaps just the opposite?",36,mtms2007-05-522a,,
"What  of  the  person  who,  in  later  life,  carefully  avoids the use of mathematics as much as possible? Can we say that his mathematics teachers were successful, simply on the basis that he was once able to  solve  quadratic  equations?  The  simplicities  of examinations  and  grades  are  no  substitute  for  the complex criteria of later life, and teachers, if not students, must be judged by these long-range criteria.",37,mtms2007-05-522a,,
Suppose that we consider a second excerpt from ,38,mtms2007-05-522a,,
Miss Meehan’s article:,39,mtms2007-05-522a,,
"I believe that we give our attention to developing the individual as a person who will be able to really live—happily,  successfully,  and  peacefully  in  our  democratic  society—and who will  know and will fight fiercely when his standards are imperiled. . . . ",40,mtms2007-05-522a,,
"What are some of these standards? 1. Accuracy—By this standard we hope to develop attitudes of promptness, precision, honesty, etc.",41,mtms2007-05-522a,,
"When Sammy, in the early grades, is given this problem, “There were five birds on a branch of a tree; two flew away; how many are still on the branch?” his answer must be “three” and only “three.” “Two” is not acceptable on the theory that if there are three left there are certainly two! What kind of a city treasurer or a club treasurer or a banker would Sammy make if we took “two” for his answer? Equivocation is not honest and we just won’t have it.3",42,mtms2007-05-522a,,
"One could discuss this excerpt at great length; let  me settle for two remarks: first, suppose that Sammy does in fact argue that there are two birds left. I think we would make a mistake if we brushed aside his logic here. We would run a grave risk of forcing him to profess a belief in our  logic, while he acquires more than a shade of doubt as to his own ability to look at the phenomena  and  follow  out  their  intrinsic  logic  himself.  Is he wrong in saying that there are two birds left? As a matter of fact, he evidently is not; he has seen a real truth concerning number which we should not brush aside. perhaps he has been more astute and more profound than we have been. He has pointed up  a  weakness,  not  in  his  logic,  but  rather  in  our question.  “Two  birds  are  left”  is  a  true  statement! What we are really asking for is the strongest statement of this kind that can be made, and “Three birds are left” is also a true statement, is stronger, and is in fact the strongest true statement, hence the answer. We would do Sammy an injustice—hardly the example which we mean to set—if we made him feel that our question was properly posed and his logic was fallacious. In truth, our question was vague, and he responded with a correct statement whose logical validity is unassailable. There are two birds left. That there are three implies a fortiori that there are two.",43,mtms2007-05-522a,,
"Sammy  has  looked  at  the  situation  clearly  and realistically. Do we wish to brush this aside? Do we  want him to take our word for it? If he does, he runs grave risks for the future. What criteria will be left him later on? Is he to try to remember what people have told him is true, or is he to try to figure it out for himself?",44,mtms2007-05-522a,,
"There is a digression here which I cannot resist. Miss Meehan argues that we want Sammy to be a good club treasurer. Well, if we are to take ultimate social values into account, as Miss Meehan essentially implies, is a numerical error in arithmetic so much worse than pathological gullibility, which we seem  to  instill  in  many  a  student  today?  Neither is  desirable  but  in  social  terms,  the  mathematics teacher might well give a thought to the question of whether he is preparing his students to believe the worst lies of propagandists, because he has taught them to disbelieve the evidence of their own senses and their own logic, and to accept a logic which is foisted upon them from without.",45,mtms2007-05-522a,,
"But that is really irrelevant to my central theme. I claim that we must have a care lest Sammy soon find himself unable to do mathematics, irrespective of whether or not he becomes grist for the mills of the propagandist. There is no foundation for science other  than  logic  mastered  within  one’s  own  mind. There is no rote approach to science. There is no acceptance of external logic. The acceptance of external logic is itself illogical.",46,mtms2007-05-522a,,
"My  second  comment  is  this:  “promptness,  precision,  honesty,  etc.”  are  worthwhile  virtues,  but we must use the words with caution, lest we be utterly misunderstood. There is a kind of compulsive promptness  which  is  virtually  nothing  more  than a  weapon  with  which  some  individuals  belabor  an easy-going  world.  Is  our  ideal  the  rigid  individual who  reproaches  acquaintances  when  they  are  two minutes late for a luncheon engagement? Or the individual who demands absolute punctuality from his employees? I should say these are hardly the ideal; the  ideal  person  is  flexible,  adaptable,  easy  to  get along with, and reasonably forgiving and generous. Training in “promptness, precision, honesty, etc.” is a strong medicine which we must take care not to administer in over-large doses. To do so is detrimental to the way the student relates to other people, is harmful to his own creative thought processes, and exerts  a  pernicious  influence  on  the  way  he  feels about himself.",47,mtms2007-05-522a,,
"I have mentioned various things which I feel the good teacher does or does not do. It is worth adding one more: I believe every really good teacher is frequently struck with a sense of awe at the consistent logic of nearly all of his students. (True, this may be most remarkably obscured by the fact that the student did not trouble himself to glance at pages nine and ten of the text, and so on.) Students, young- sters, even infants show an almost incredible natural gift for logic. I recently watched a nine-month-old baby trying to escape past a gate that had been put in place with him in mind. In back of him was an unfastened gate of identical construction, not needed at  the  moment.  After  unsuccessful  efforts  at  moving the fastened gate, the baby returned to the unfastened gate, which he could move with ease. He repeatedly went from one gate to the other, clearly attempting to use the one as an example of how to solve the problem of the second. I am awe-struck by the cleverness of such an approach.",48,mtms2007-05-522a,,
"Many remarks along the present lines could be appended  to  various  other  excerpts  from  “Mathematics  and  the  Development  of  Good  Citizens.” I may as well confess that, taking that article as a whole, I feel a lack of sympathy with the tone of it, though perhaps I misunderstand the true meaning. To  arrive  at  a  proper  balance  in  educational  matters requires constant discussion, a constant meeting of different minds. Teachers must be especially alert  to  recognize  any  harmful tendency  in  themselves  toward being  over-controlling  or  overly rigid. The teacher is so frequently right, and stands so unmistakably in  a  controlling  position,  that  he must  make  great  efforts  to  yield to  the  correct  logic  of  students, and  to  permit  them  the  generous  amount  of  freedom  which  is necessary  for  learning.  Students must  be  allowed  to  make  mistakes, to try out their own ideas, to think for themselves. Good teaching cannot be built on the attitude that the students are  stupid.  In  point  of  fact,  the  logic  of  students, as  has  been  remarked  on  above,  is  nearly  always at least partly correct. The good teacher builds on the correct part, whereas the poor teacher attacks the weaker part. Hence the good teacher leads the student along the path to self-reliance and self-confidence, while the poor teacher induces feelings of inadequacy and distaste for the subject.",49,mtms2007-05-522a,,
"unfortunately,  a  correct  evaluation  of  oneself is  extremely  difficult.  Many  of  the  best  teachers struggle  prodigiously  for  self-improvement;  many poor  teachers,  over-controlling  and  rigid,  continue complacently  in  the  same  course  year  after  year. It  has  been  wisely  said  that  one  must  distinguish twenty  years  of  experience,  which  some  teachers have, from one year of experience repeated twenty times, which other teachers have. few poor teaches  show  any  real  awareness  of  their  inadequacy; rather, they have countless rationalizations to justify themselves.",50,mtms2007-05-522a,,

"VOL. 12, NO. 9  .  MAy 2007   527 4. Two remarks. The reader who is familiar with certain  sociological  critiques  of  the  culture  of  the united States (and perhaps especially of New England)  may  have  recognized  that  many  of  my  comments  have  been  expressed  in  other  language  by saying that we have inherited a culture which, if it has a major defect, suffers chiefly from this: it prevents too many things, in the general sense. It is itself over-controlling, overly rigid. It seeks to mold youth too much, and to let it grow too little. Somehow this all  adds  up  to  an  effect  of  stifling  creative  expression.  Mathematics  teaching  might  be  said  to  tend to reflect this cultural characteristic. It would not be appropriate to consider the issue on broad sociological grounds in this article, and I do not mean to do so. Right within the needs of the creative teaching situation itself we can find ample motivation for encouraging individuality and not emphasizing routine acceptance of externally imposed logic.",52,mtms2007-05-522a,,
"It occurs to me that I have not used the word rote in this article—not yet, in any event. By rote teaching I mean the presentation of facts and techniques which are simply to be memorized by the student, with perhaps a certain amount of practice on some of the techniques. This, I claim, is not teaching at all.  At  least,  it  is  not  the  teaching  of  mathematics. Mathematics  is  not  a  tool.  It  is  a  way  of  thinking which is creative, flexible, perceptive of reality, and based  upon  certain  good  judgment  as to  what  may  be  eliminated,  and  what must be retained, in the process of abstraction.  It  recognizes  objectives,  and selects strategies. None of this is taught by rote presentation. That some teachers will tell me they can achieve high quiz grades  by  rote  teaching  is  irrelevant.  They  have taught all of the inessentials, they have tested all of the inessentials, and they have found their students well versed in all of the inessentials. What has that to do with what I have to say?",53,mtms2007-05-522a,,
"To teach is to inspire 5.  Summary.  But  to  return  to  my  basic  theme. Talk about teaching has a tendency to be unsatisfactorily vague, and I would wish to be as concrete and precise as the nonverbal nature of the subject will permit. My chief remark is that rational thought processes are under the influence of emotional factors. This is not a slight influence. On the contrary, emotional factors have a decisiveness which the teacher cannot afford to ignore. If one looks at a school, the over-all  pattern  of  students  doing  well  in  courses they like, badly in courses they dislike, and so on, is the first thing that hits the eye. The cumulative effect  of  this  sort  of  preference,  over  many  years, gives rise to what we call aptitude for one subject,  or lack of aptitude for another. (I do not, of course, mean  to  restrict  attention  to  experiences  within the classroom only, nor even to the experiences of school  years  alone.  The  bases  of  aptitudes,  as  the toy-makers have lost no time in pointing out, extend far back and into experiences of all sorts. The teacher is only one influence, but he is one.)",54,mtms2007-05-522a,,
"I  wish  the  classroom  experience  were  not  so intangible.  It  is  a  most  refractory  matter  for  discussion.  I  should  like  to  give  an  example  of  some instance where a teacher has, in a subtle and nonverbal  way,  exerted  an  influence  toward  creative thought in students, or, perhaps, an instance of the opposite sort of thing. As a matter of fact, fate has just handed me one example, and, inadequate as it is, let it do. I just interrupted this article to meet a class for the first session of the term. One problem was checking students’ names against class cards. Now, the pronunciation of students’ names is one of the less certain and predictable phenomena of the universe, and the teacher is not unlikely to be occasionally in error. Just how he handles this situation, the extent to which he encourages students to feel free and secure in correcting him—after all, here is one case where the student is the absolute authority—the way he responds when students do criticize him (and they may not do it gently) sets a good deal of the tone of the class, for that day at least. Or perhaps I should say, this is a very little thing. It is one case  where  the  contest  between  power  and  truth is being fought, in the subtlest of ways. The basic principle of psychology, however, seems to be that everything is the outcome of the summation of all of these little things. They are small tokens, but they add up to a potent currency.",55,mtms2007-05-522a,,
"In case my meaning is not clear, I might add that the mature teacher, who wishes the student to learn to stand on his own feet, will show a generous ability to accept criticism, and will not respond by threatening the student in any way. Do we want the student to think for himself, or don’t we? If he is right and we, the teacher, are wrong, we cannot ever be too ready to admit it. The more willingly we do it, the better.",56,mtms2007-05-522a,,
"What can be done in the classroom, to improve student  performance,  is  in  its  way  as  definite  and as  important  as  any  of  the  phenomena  of  science and art. unfortunately, it is sadly neglected. I cannot  say  there  is  anything  like  the  optimal  amount of  freedom,  democracy,  consistent  objectivity,  and inspiration in the average classroom. Too often one sees a teacher who insists upon being right, who is unreceptive to new ideas, who is unperceptive of the subtler needs of students, or who lacks the vital interest in his subject matter which is necessary if he is to inspire his students. The teacher is rarely able to evaluate himself accurately, especially in view of  the  nonverbal  nature  of  the  subject; though his words be generous and accepting, it matters not—the real question  is  whether  or  not  his  manner  is threatening.",57,mtms2007-05-522a,,
"The constructive use of atmosphere to  enhance  problem-solving  ability  is strikingly  akin  to  the  psychoanalyst’s use  of  “conversation”  in  treating  neuroses. In either case, one is amazed at how  much  can  be  done,  and  by  such subtle influences. It is to be regretted that the present-day acceptance of the psychiatrist’s  “conversational”  methods as something definite and real (and even dramatic) does not extend more fully to include the similar techniques and problems of the teacher. One can hope for the day when a profound understanding  of  emotional  dynamics will be recognized as an ordinary tool of the teacher’s trade, virtually on the same  level  as  the  ability  to  speak  his or her native tongue. The teacher must be alert to the needs and attitudes of the student, and must be able to modify these attitudes, or respond to these needs,  wherever  the  occasion  arises. If  the  teacher  is  less  than  this,  he  is nothing  more  than  a  textbook,  and may  strongly  influence  the  student away from creativity and toward sterile routine. ",58,mtms2007-05-522a,,
