How do middle school students interpret the phrase “two sizes too small”? Examining students’ responses will re-form your thinking about teaching similarity and using nonstandard shapes. ,3,mtms2012-11-228a,,
"Dana c. cox and Michael todd edwards tThe opening lines of How the Grinch Stole Christmas! (Geisel 1957) set the tone  for an inspiring change-of-heart story about a grumpy creature that comes to value humanity and the Christmas spirit. Although the book is often considered inspirational for other reasons, we were particularly moved by Dr. Seuss’s interesting conjecture regarding the origin of the Grinch’s bah-humbug spirit—the size of his heart—when he wrote, “May have been that his heart was two sizes too small.” ",4,mtms2012-11-228a,,
What does it mean that his heart was “two sizes too small”? What do students  think of this question? This is the story of what we discovered when we asked middle school students what “two sizes too small” means. Their answers may change the way you think about teaching similarity. ,5,mtms2012-11-228a,,
Traditional similarity tasks do not give us access either to our visual intuitions or to our tactile development.,6,mtms2012-11-228a,,
"What IS tWo siZes  too sMall? We begin this story by sharing our students’ thinking about the Grinch’s heart and how they answered the question. Interpreting what it means to be two sizes too small is difficult work, and we have found that it makes for a lively discussion about size and scale. ",7,mtms2012-11-228a,,
"In our classroom conversations with students, some compare the Grinch’s heart with an item of clothing. If your sweater is two sizes too small, it means that you have squeezed yourself into a size 6 when you are really a size 8. (Or is it a size 10?) This makes a lot of sense, but it gets more complicated the deeper you go. You can subtract 2 from the size number, but how does that size 6 sweater really compare with the size 8 version? Is it two inches shorter? Is the neckline two inches tighter? If you layered one on top of the other, how would they compare? ",8,mtms2012-11-228a,,
"Two sizes too small could mean that the heart has been shrunk, as if that sweater was put in a hot dryer and emerged much smaller than when it went in. Students conjecture that the Grinch’s heart may be one-half its original size or half the size twice; that it holds half as much blood; or that it is half as tall, or half as wide, or both. For us, many key moments occur in such a discussion, but perhaps most key is the first time a student suggests  that the Grinch’s heart looks exactly like a normal heart, only smaller. In fact, when this conjecture emerges, we give it weight by writing it on the board and asking students to discuss what they think it means. This statement is important in establishing a concept image of proportionality, and it will be helpful in our next task.",9,mtms2012-11-228a,,
"Although we are careful not to  stifle student conjectures, we begin to mentally sort additive thinking from multiplicative thinking as students share their interpretations and describe related experiences that they feel are relevant. Furthermore, we find this discussion helpful at the beginning of a unit on similarity in generating a more mathematical, yet still relevant, discussion about how to quantify size and shape and make comparisons between objects. With each new conjecture about the meaning of two sizes too small come future opportunities to use mathematical language and structures to model a real-life context.",10,mtms2012-11-228a,,

"We wanted to extend this idea and give students a chance to explore their conjectures about size and scale in a less mathematically ambiguous environment. Therefore, we assigned the Two Hearts task. To consider a figure like a heart when presenting a unit on similarity placed us in unfamiliar territory. Historically ( Johnson 1966) and even today (Lo, Cox, and Mingus  2006), students are generally given triangles and polygons to explore when studying similar figures. By using a heart shape, we were pleasantly rewarded with motivated students and rich classroom discussion.",12,mtms2012-11-228a,,

",14,mtms2012-11-228a,,
"Before assigning the Two Hearts task, we made sure to bridge earlier discussions that introduced mathematical language about what it means to be two sizes too small. We generally reemphasize the conjecture that the Grinch’s heart looks the same as a normal heart, only smaller. We then talk about other items that have this property. Students readily offer examples of miniature models, toys, maps, typographic fonts, and even photographs. We then introduce ",15,mtms2012-11-228a,,

"The following strategies are representative of a body of work that we have collected in the last four years from middle school students. Not all the strategies are valid or based on multiplicative reasoning; however, they all enriched our classroom discussion of the task. We have organized the strategies into two categories: (1) visual and (2) measurement.",23,mtms2012-11-228a,,
VisUal stRategies,24,mtms2012-11-228a,,
"Visual strategies are typically associated with guesswork. While students are justifying a visual strategy, they rarely use mathematical tools such as differences, ratios, or measurements. For example, when sharing her strategy for scaling the heart (as drawn in fig. 2a), Madeline explained,",25,mtms2012-11-228a,,
"All I did was look at the heart; the design of what it was drawn. I looked at it while I was drawing, too. I was trying to make it exactly like it was. ",26,mtms2012-11-228a,,
"Dylan’s strategy was also visual  (see fig. 2b). He used the lower angle of the heart to anchor his drawing. Sketching a few lines as guides, he next identified what he felt would be the location of the top angle. After matching the two angles, he sketched the rest of the heart, attempting to mimic the curves of the lobes and connect the rays of his angles.",27,mtms2012-11-228a,,
"Henry’s strategy gave the overall impression of a picture frame: The smaller center heart followed the outer curve by remaining a constant distance away at all points (see  fig. 2c). In discussion, Henry indicated that he believed that the lines connecting the original heart to the image were all the same length. As he drew these lines, it was interesting to note his quiet struggles with the pattern around both the top and the bottom angles. Note the changes in the direction of the segments drawn.",28,mtms2012-11-228a,,
"MeasUReMent stRategies Some students examined the heart more quantitatively and scaled it analytically. To use numeric methods of comparison-like differences (additive reasoning) or ratios (multiplicative reasoning), students must first decide what to measure and how to measure it. We have found that students chose various measurements while working with this activity. Giving students rulers or other measuring tools, which are certainly not required, may influence their thinking on this task. When we did not provide rulers, we found that students chose nonstandard techniques such as using finger widths, marking distances on paper, or even folding the paper to divide or split drawn segments. Figure 3 highlights some of the most common measurements that students made.",29,mtms2012-11-228a,,
"Printing the heart on grid paper  gave students another means with which to measure. One measurement approach, scaling the heart by resizing the grid boxes, emerged when we did not provide grid paper (see fig. 4).",30,mtms2012-11-228a,,
What the tasK told Us,31,mtms2012-11-228a,,
"In each of the strategies that we observed, it was possible to acquire a sense of how students were thinking about proportion. As students worked, we circulated around the room to assess what strategies were being used and how students were measuring or using provided tools. We also asked students to explain what they had drawn or written. Although we became more familiar with common strategies over time, it was helpful in the beginning to pause in our work with this task overnight. It gave us time to assess the written work of our students so that the next day’s lesson could build on our findings.",32,mtms2012-11-228a,,
"After examining the strategies, we  drew some conclusions. Within  Madeline’s statement, we found evidence that she thought the resulting figure would not be distorted in any way and would resemble the original. Dylan used congruence implicitly when sketching corresponding angles.",33,mtms2012-11-228a,,
"Henry’s sketch indicated that he also had ideas about correspondence  and how one shape had been transformed into the other through scaling. The segments that joined corresponding points along the edge of the heart showed that Henry was capable of visualizing multidirectional growth. Henry’s solution, which showed that he believed that the distance between the hearts should be constant, indicated that he was still using additive, not multiplicative, thinking. Another student who used Henry’s strategy underscored this additive thinking with this comment:",34,mtms2012-11-228a,,
"I said this because there is 1 inch in diameter going away from the heart, and all around the heart is 1 inch diameter, which is exactly the heart only 1 inch larger.",35,mtms2012-11-228a,,
"Compelling to us were the measurement strategies and the nature of the segments that students chose to measure. Unlike the polygons and triangles that students are often asked to scale in textbooks, the heart has no straight edges and only two vertices. Students must create distances to measure by either visualizing or drawing endpoints at key locations. The more measurements a student makes, the more that student is creating tools for analytic reasoning. Furthermore, it is possible to note from these measurements whether a student is computing with differences or ratios.",36,mtms2012-11-228a,,

"In our discussion of the task, we always began with a deep look at visual strategies. We found that was helpful to make ideas of correspondence and congruence explicit before an analytical examination of the shape. We used a statement like Madeline’s to probe more deeply by asking, “What does it mean to be exactly like it was?” We also asked students to illustrate the correspondences that they had noted ",38,mtms2012-11-228a,,
"Fig. 4 When grid paper was not provided, students often rescaled the image by creating their own grid and then resizing it.",39,mtms2012-11-228a,,

(a) original   heart  (b) Multiplicative  approach  (c) Additive approach in their own work. For example, we asked Dylan to point out the congruent angles, and we asked Henry to draw a few of those correspondence lines on the board. We were also careful to document on the board the descriptive language that all students used. In so doing, we could watch how students built on one another’s ideas and appropriated their terms or representations.",40,mtms2012-11-228a,,
"This discussion moved seamlessly  into student descriptions of different measurement strategies. It was especially powerful if the measurement strategies capitalized on the correspondences that students had  already noticed when discussing visual strategies. If necessary, we asked, “Did anyone measure anything when creating your drawings?” We also found it helpful to contrast additive and multiplicative thinking by having students display their work side by side (see  fig. 5) and asking them to describe the different results.",41,mtms2012-11-228a,,

"Making the transition from additive to multiplicative thinking is extremely difficult for students and not likely to be accomplished in a few short lessons (Lobato and Ellis 2010). Here  we present three general teaching strategies for helping students move beyond additive reasoning when solving similarity tasks. Although they are based on the kind of reasoning we saw students using when trying the Two Hearts task, they are applicable whether or not you discuss the Grinch’s heart or use the Two Hearts task in your classroom.",43,mtms2012-11-228a,,

"A strategy for constructing similar fi gures should work when it is repeatedly applied. All the resulting images are similar to the original. Thus, to help students question and challenge invalid strategies, ask them to apply it repeatedly to the same fi gure and then compare the exaggerated result. For example, as Henry’s strategy was applied repeatedly to the green rectangle in fi gure 6, it became increasingly visually clear that the last rectangle generated (depicted in red in fi g. 6) was not similar to the original rectangle. The inner frames became more of a rectangular shape with each successive iteration.",45,mtms2012-11-228a,,
"To further illustrate how this strategy can encourage refl ection and evaluation, consider the work of Emerald in fi gure 7. On her own, Emerald generated a series of concentrically framed hearts when solving the initial Two Hearts task. She wrote at the bottom, “I know it’s not right.” The centermost heart was clearly not the same shape as the original because it had extended lobes and was much wider than it was tall. The original’s height was almost the same as its width.",46,mtms2012-11-228a,,
"Emerald was able to look at her design, refl ect on her construction, and determine that it was incorrect. This strategy is benefi cial because it enables students to use visual evidence to explore and explain the relationship between the two shapes. In fact, despite being mathematically correct, ",47,mtms2012-11-228a,,

Use digital iMages to adVantage,55,mtms2012-11-228a,,
"Our understanding of proportionality is infl uenced by real-life contexts found in photography and models and in physical manipulations, such as those in zooming technologies. Playing with miniatures, building scale models, and looking at photographs train us to draw inferences about  scaled images. When we present geometric objects that are void of that vital context, we prevent students from applying instinctive tools in their search for proportionality. Tasks that present geometric shapes without a context ignore proportional intuition that students bring to the classroom from prior experiences. Without a context for the two rectangles in fi gure 8, it is diffi cult to assess visually whether or not the two rectangles are similar. As is, there is virtually no way for a student to autonomously invalidate the additive strategy. However, by placing copies of the same digital image inside the green and red rectangles, we make it easier for students to judge similarity by providing additional visual cues and sources of distortion. For an example, see fi gure 9.",56,mtms2012-11-228a,,
"How does the photograph on  the right in fi gure 9 compare with the original photograph on the left? Are they proportional to each other? When looking at the photographs, our students felt strongly that the two rectangles in fi gure 9 were not proportional, even without measuring side lengths and setting up a proportion to study them numerically. Visual clues indicated to our practiced eyes that there was distortion present and that these photographs were nonproportional; perhaps you noticed that the ball was spherical in the smaller rectangle, but it was not in the larger rectangle. If you were tempted to believe the same green and red frames were similar in fi gure 8, you may be reconsidering now that a photograph has been placed inside of them.  go BeYond Rectangles",57,mtms2012-11-228a,,
"Another way to help students develop a deep understanding of geometric proportion is to develop tasks (such as Two Hearts) that include more complex shapes to challenge rote procedures for scaling. Although the familiar mantra “whatever you do to one side, you must do to the others” seems to push students through typical textbook problems involving rectangles and triangles, this statement is neither insightful nor particularly useful in dispelling additive notions about proportion when students are scaling complex fi gures. Using complex fi gures helps students develop more robust strategies and investigate more global rules for scaling. It also enables them to develop creative measurement strategies and pushes them to see the relationships between scaled images beyond the numeric proportion.  the PoWeR oF nonPolYgonal FigURes",58,mtms2012-11-228a,,
"In this article, we have begun to explore similarity from a new  perspective that builds on student intuition, incorporates nonpolygonal figures, and emphasizes visual context and judgment. This perspective moves us beyond problems that seek to boil down the concepts of scale to rote numerical procedures toward lessons that capitalize on existing experience and understanding that students already have. The Two Hearts task and resulting discussion have been used to assess what students think, but also to help them rigorously and scientifically challenge themselves and one another.
