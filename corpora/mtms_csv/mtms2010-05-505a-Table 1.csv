"Developing Mathematical Habits of Mind “Although it is necessary to infuse courses and curricula with modern content, what is even more important is to give students the tools they will need in order to use, understand, and even make mathematics that does not yet exist. A curriculum organized around habits of mind tries to close the gap between what the users and makers of mathematics do and what they say” (Cuoco, Goldenberg, and Mark 1996, p. 376). The three articles in this cross-journal “Contemporary Curriculum Issues” series are written by the Educational Development Center curriculum development team of Cuoco, Goldenberg, Mark, and Sword. The team pioneered work using mathematical habits of mind that are central to the work of mathematicians for organizing school math curricula. Regardless of the level at which you teach, you will find that each article’s important message is relevant across the grades. The TCM article considers algebra’s ideas, logic, techniques, and habits of mind, as well as when and to what extent they can be learned with intellectual integrity in the elementary school grades before a formal course on algebra. The authors of the MT article reflect on their work in using the habits-of-mind approach for organizing high school curricula. They indicate that such an approach offers a vehicle for paring down the collection of methods and techniques one needs in high school, leaving a small set of general-purpose tools that tie together many seemingly different mathematical terrains. Building coherence in the development of mathematical ideas across the grades is key to improving students’ mathematical learning in the United States. Knowing the mathematical experiences, understanding, skills, and habits of mind that students bring to a grade level and what the expectations are for those grades can help teachers bridge the transitions for students at each end.",2,mtms2010-05-505a,,
"This department provided a forum to stimulate discussion on contemporary curricular issues across a K–12 audience. NCTM has published sets of three articles, focused on a single curriculum issue. Each article has addressed the issue from the perspective of the audience of the journal in which it appears. Collectively, the articles were intended to increase communication and dialogue on issues of common interest related to curriculum. ",3,mtms2010-05-505a,,
"Mathematical habits of mind include reasoning by continuity, looking at extreme cases, performing thought experiments, and using abstraction that mathematicians use in their work (Cuoco, Goldenberg, and Mark 1996; Goldenberg 1996). Current recommendations emphasize the critical nature of developing these habits of mind: “Once this kind of thinking is established, students can apply it in the context of geometry, trigonometry, calculus, data and statistics, or other advanced courses” (Achieve 2008, p. 4).",4,mtms2010-05-505a,,
The newly published Focus in High ,5,mtms2010-05-505a,,
"School Mathematics (NCTM 2009) suggests that curricular approaches emphasizing sense making and reasoning are necessary foundations for the content taught in high school. We argue that developing mathematical habits of mind in the middle grades is essential for students who are making the critical transition from arithmetic to algebra. These habits can also build on students’ early algebraic thinking and help them move toward a more formal investigation of algebraic ideas typically found in an eighth-grade or ninth-grade algebra course. For more than a decade, we and others have  been engaged in curriculum development efforts that aim to provide students with the kinds of experiences that will help develop these mathematical habits and put them into practice (Cuoco 2007, 2008; EDC 2008, 2009; Goldenberg and Shteingold 2007).",6,mtms2010-05-505a,,
"Much more important than specific mathematical results are the habits of mind used by the people who create those results. We envision curricula that elevate the methods by which mathematics is created and the techniques used by researchers to a status equal to that enjoyed by the results of that research. Our goal is not to train large numbers of students to be university mathematicians, but rather for students to become comfortable solving mathematical problems, to see the benefit of being systematic and using abstract reasoning, and to look for and develop new ways of describing situations. We want students to gain the tools they will need to use, understand, and even make mathematics that does not yet exist.  the tRansition FRoM aRithMetic to algeBRa",7,mtms2010-05-505a,,
"Through our curriculum development work, we found overwhelming uniformity in mathematics teachers’ assessments of the areas that cause students to struggle with algebra. Students appear to have trouble with the following aspects of mathematics: •	 Expressing	generality	with	algebraic notation, especially prevalent when students set up equations to solve word problems •	 Understanding	slope,	graphing	 lines, and finding equations of lines  •	 Making	sensible	and	fluent	calculations with fractions  •	 Understanding	and	using	proportional reasoning •	 Building	and	using	algebraic	  functions",8,mtms2010-05-505a,,
"At first read, this list looks like a collection of disparate topics. However, the common thread running through these topics lies in the mode of thinking required to master them. The key to such mastery are the two mathematical habits of— 1.  abstracting regularity from calculations and  2.  articulating a generalization using  mathematical language. ",9,mtms2010-05-505a,,
"These skills are extremely effective in helping students transition from arithmetic to algebra. By “effective,” we mean that students who succeed in algebra have developed these habits, whereas students who struggle at the cusp between arithmetic and algebra have not (Koedinger 2002). ",10,mtms2010-05-505a,,
"Our experience has shown that as  students become more practiced at repeated calculations, they gain the experiential foundation for identifying a regular pattern in their mental work. They also begin to see calculations, and the patterns they embody, as part of a larger algebraic process. In so doing, they are able to connect prealgebraic calculations to an algebraic process.  tWo KeY algeBRaic  haBits oF Mind",11,mtms2010-05-505a,,
"Algebra as a scientific discipline evolved in an attempt to express general properties of binary operations (such as addition and multiplication) without having to refer to specific inputs to those operations. The need to abstract from calculations is essential to success in algebra. In the following example, the skill of abstracting from calculations is combined with the habit of expressing the abstraction with algebraic symbols to solve the problem. Using the guess, check, and generalize method makes a challenging topic (such as solving word problems) much easier for students. ",12,mtms2010-05-505a,,
Example 1: Comparing CD Prices,13,mtms2010-05-505a,,
"Suppose you want to buy a music CD. A Web site offers a 28 percent discount on the list price. It also adds 5 percent for state sales tax and $3.50 for shipping. The local music store sells CDs for 10 percent off the list price, also charges 5 percent sales tax, but has no shipping charge. Ignoring convenience and drive time, is it less expensive to buy online or to buy from the local music store? ",14,mtms2010-05-505a,,
"Many ad hoc ways of solving such problems are possible, but a core algebraic approach is to develop a function or algorithm that will allow the student to easily compute the price of a CD in each scenario. For example, when buying from the Web site, the total cost of a CD is determined by taking the list price, subtracting 28 percent, then adding 5 percent and $3.50.",15,mtms2010-05-505a,,
"This may sound simple enough,  but students who have difficulty with algebra are often unable to articulate this process without referring to a specific price, such as $25. In other words, they can compute the total cost of a CD for any particular list price, but cannot express the general process for calculating the total cost of a CD. That process is precisely the first step needed to find the breakeven point (either by trial and error or by solving an equation).",16,mtms2010-05-505a,,
"One way to develop the skill of  expressing generality is to begin with some numerical examples until a student “gets the rhythm” of the calculations and is able to articulate the cost of a CD in a way that will work for any price. If shopping on the Web, the thought development might proceed in this way. ",17,mtms2010-05-505a,,
"If the CD lists for $25, this is my cost:  $25	–	0.28	•	25	=	$18,	then 1.05	•	$18	=	$18.90,	then	 $18.90 +	$3.50	=	$22.40.",18,mtms2010-05-505a,,
"If the CD lists for $30, this would  be my cost:  example, the corresponding algorithm for the music store is $30 −	0.28	•	30	=	$21.60,	then 1.05	•	$21.60	=	$22.68,	then $22.68	+	$3.50	=	$26.18.",19,mtms2010-05-505a,,
"Eventually, after several more  examples, you can start to “chain” the calculation; a $20 CD is used below:  1.05	•	($20	−	0.28	•	20)	+	$3.50",20,mtms2010-05-505a,,
"With a few more examples, the general process emerges. The actual value of the list price does not matter; the steps are always the same. Using a placeholder c for the list price, the process continues:  or 1.05(c −	0.28	•	c) + $3.50  1.05	•	0.72c + $3.50",21,mtms2010-05-505a,,
We want to focus on the dual skills  of (1) expressing this form of generality with algebraic symbolism and  (2) transforming the resulting expressions to solve problems. In this  1.05	•	0.9	•	c.,22,mtms2010-05-505a,,
"To determine the break-even point, find the value of c so that  1.05	•	0.72c	+	$3.50	=	1.05	•	0.9c.",23,mtms2010-05-505a,,
"This method—called guess, check, and generalize—is not meant to be a guess-and-check method. The goal is for the student to realize that he or she is always repeating the same arithmetic calculations (with different numbers) and is then generalizing from those calculations. Because word problems are common in most middle school mathematics materials, students have myriad opportunities to practice the skill of guess, check, and generalize and hone their abilities to use these two key algebraic habits of mind.",24,mtms2010-05-505a,,
"Students can use this approach for any word problem they encounter. For example, there is no need for specialized approaches when problems involve rate or mixture. The real beauty is that it allows students to develop the powerful mathematical habits of mind of abstracting regularity from  calculations and articulating a generalization using mathematical language. ",25,mtms2010-05-505a,,
Example 2: Multiplication ,26,mtms2010-05-505a,,
"Patterns The next example shows how algebraic language is used to describe a discovery that students make. In the abstract, we would describe it as an algebraic identity. Students reexamine  multiplication facts with a pattern-seeking mind-set. They conduct elementary mathematical “research”— looking for a mathematical  pattern and then extending and generalizing it—to practice their algebraicdescriptive skills and gain greater computational fluency. (See fig. 1 for an example of students’ work using a number line.)",27,mtms2010-05-505a,,
"Students learn that notation is  another way of describing what they already know, rather than it being an arbitrary code that means “you plug in the number where you see the letter.” This learning process occurs in essentially the same way in which all language is learned. ",28,mtms2010-05-505a,,
"This learning situation is a case of abstracting a common structure from a repeated calculation. Students make the abstraction naturally and demonstrate that they have already made the abstraction by answering 2499 when presented	with	49	•	51.	The	new	and	 harder step is to articulate what they already know: The algebraic “trick” of giving names to numbers helps make the description easier, first in English and then abbreviated in algebraic style.",29,mtms2010-05-505a,,
"This process allows students to  transition from performing concrete calculations to noticing the structure of those calculations and describing that structure in algebraic language. Students get the clear message that mathematics has the power to explain, and that symbolism is a help, not just an extra task to learn. Students develop that algebraic language not from a set of arbitrary symbols and rules but as a natural way of expressing what they already know. In so doing, it gives them a simpler and less cumbersome way to express mathematical ideas than that provided by spoken language.  conclUsion",30,mtms2010-05-505a,,
We have used these examples to illustrate two particularly powerful mathematical habits of mind that focus on the critical transition from arithmetic to algebra. These habits take advantage  35 36,31,mtms2010-05-505a,,

Most students notice a pattern: The numbers in each pair differ by 1. They are delighted when they discover that they can multiply 49 × 51 in their heads by using the pattern that they have abstracted from this experiment.,37,mtms2010-05-505a,,

"But describing this abstraction in English proves to be difficult. Students may remark, “if you take a number and multiply it by itself, then, if you take the next number and multiply it by the number just before the number. . . .” But when we give names to the number—perhaps the name of the student—it gets much easier. “if you take a number, let’s call it Dana, then (Dana – 1) × (Dana + 1) is one fewer than Dana × Dana.” That can be abbreviated to  2499 2500 2499 2500 49       50        51 (d – 1) × (d + 1) = d × d – 1, 49       50        51 or simply  (d – 1)(d + 1) = d2 – 1.",39,mtms2010-05-505a,,

The middle grades are an especially good time developmentally to build these skills. Students are certainly able to use language adeptly to express and describe mathematical ideas, which they must do before they  can become comfortable with formal operations and working with the more formal syntactic and deductive aspects of algebra.
