"Questions about fair shares occur frequently. How can we share 3 apples among 4 people? How do we split a bill for dinner fairly among all diners? The following example illustrates one way to determine how to share loaves of bread fairly.  1.  A caterer needs to share 3 equal- size loaves of bread among 5 tables of guests at a dinner party. Use the rectangles below to show how you would share the bread equally.  a.  Starting with your own sketch of the loaves above, show how much bread each table will receive. ",2,mtms2012-04-512a,,

Compare the total amount of bread on 1 table with 1 loaf of bread. What fraction of 1 loaf of bread is on each table? c.  Compare the total amount on  each table with the 3 loaves. What fraction of 3 loaves will  1 table receive?   d.  Write a division problem that represents the sharing of the loaves of bread.  2.  The caterer has 7 loaves of bread for a party with 5 tables of guests. Use rectangles similar to those in problem 1 to show how you would share the bread equally.",3,mtms2012-04-512a,,
"a.  Separate from the original loaves  of bread, sketch how much bread each table will get.    b.  Compare the total amount   of bread on 1 table with  1 loaf of bread. What fraction  of 1 loaf of bread is on  each table? c.  Compare the total amount that  1 table will get with all 3 loaves of bread. What fraction of  3 loaves will 1 table receive?   d.
