"books empowering the Mentor of the  experienced Mathematics teacher Edited by Gwen Zimmermann, Patricia Guinee, Linda M. Fulmore, and Elizabeth Murray, 2009. 73 pp., $22.95 paper. Stock no. 13491. ISBN 978-0-87353-626-4. NCTM; www.nctm.org. ",3,mtms2010-02-366a,,
"Empowering the Mentor of the Experienced Mathematics Teacher is a basic hands-on guide about being a good mentor. The title suggests that the book was written only for mentors of experienced mathematics teachers, but much of the information concerns mentoring novice mathematics teachers and could apply to their mentor, as well. The topics include what mentoring is, what a mentor does, collaboration, and ideas for mentoring programs. One of the most interesting examples showing collaboration and mentoring occurs when the book describes how to encourage reflection on specific parts of a lesson (pp. 35, 36) without using judgmental terminology.",4,mtms2010-02-366a,,

"The advantages of mathematics teachers who collaborate instead of work in isolation are explained in detail. Benefits realized by the mentee and the mentor are described on page 41. The relationship, when working well, produces growth for both participants. Many teaching methods, such as inquiry and problem solving, have not been mastered by the mentee, so when mentoring the novice teacher through lesson development, mentors often increase their own mathematical expertise as well. ",6,mtms2010-02-366a,,
"The authors develop the idea that mentoring is not just about pedagogy (classroom management, lesson plans, and so on), but also about content. Most teachers, regardless of how well they know and understand their content, have at least one area of weakness. Helping them boost their knowledge and confidence enhances their pedagogical skills and their success as a teacher.",7,mtms2010-02-366a,,
"The book appears to have more  instruction and ideas for middle school and high school mathematics teachers. Although there are sections for elementary school teachers, and all areas discussed apply to all grade levels, many elementary school teachers do not consider themselves mathematics teachers, and some display anxiety toward math. These teachers need a special kind of mentoring so they are able to rid themselves of their anxiety and not pass it on to their students.",8,mtms2010-02-366a,,
"Anyone who mentors a mathematics teacher, who is in the process of developing a mentoring program, or who is training mentor teachers would find significant information in this book. It explains many how-to situations to help mentors with their approaches and describes the correct terminology to use when talking to mentees that will produce successful  relationships and successful teachers.",9,mtms2010-02-366a,,

"Focus in grade 5: teaching with curriculum Focal Points Edited by Sybilla Beckmann, 2009. 87 pp., $34.95 paper. ISBN 9780-87353-614-1. Stock no. 13437. NCTM; www.nctm.org. ",13,mtms2010-02-366a,,
"The Teaching with Curriculum Focal Points series was developed to encourage national consistency in mathematics curriculum by directing teachers to prioritize their instruction around gradelevel topics of emphasis called Focal Points. Focus in Grade 5 identifies the fifth-grade Focal Points and discusses the progression of learning each topic with understanding. Relevant mathematics problems with graphic and symbolic solutions are included as well as explanations of common errors made while learning the topics. Often, prerequisite knowledge by grade level and a preview of upcoming, related concepts are provided. ",14,mtms2010-02-366a,,
"This book is not meant to be a  comprehensive curriculum. Instead, NCTM hopes that teachers will, by using this guide, more intentionally connect all fifth-grade mathematics topics to the Focal Points to support mastery of these key concepts.",15,mtms2010-02-366a,,
"The fifth-grade Focal Points may  not align with state benchmarks or the scope and sequence of curricula. For example, contrary to some standards, Focus in Grade 5 does not specifically identify dividing by twodigit divisors as a Focal Point of fifth grade, nor does it include multiplication and division using fractions and decimals. In addition, the geometry Focal Points are advanced; finding the area of triangles and complex figures as well as learning about the volume and surface area of figures are topics often taught in sixth grade or higher. Despite this inconsistency, Focus in Grade 5 is an important read for teachers and curriculum administrators because it promotes focused instruction and pedagogy that encourages learning with understanding. In addition, it provides an overview of the progressive learning of key topics, reminding teachers and mathematics teams to foster coherency in their programs.",16,mtms2010-02-366a,,

"This product contains a games applet that gives practice and review problems from the elementary grades to upper middle school. The applet is very simple to operate. There are six levels to choose from, each ranked in difficulty. Once a level is chosen, a problem appears. A user enters a numerical answer and presses “Enter.” If the answer is correct, the user moves to another problem. If the answer is incorrect, the applet reads “incorrect,” and the user enters a new answer until it is correct. ",20,mtms2010-02-366a,,
"There are twenty-eight to thirtytwo problems per game. Each level uses algebraic problems requiring two steps to solve. Elementary problems include terms such as half, double, and triple. As the problems and levels increase, words are replaced with more mathematical terms—for example, half is replaced with divided by two.",21,mtms2010-02-366a,,
"This product is a useful tool for encouraging algebraic thinking, mental math skills, and creative methods for solving problems. The timer that is included in the set and that counts up is another benefit: It allows students to complete a desired number of problems without feeling the pressure of a clock counting down to zero.",22,mtms2010-02-366a,,
"The only improvement that I  would recommend is removing the terms elementary school and middle school from the difficulty levels. The bars should be labeled by color and by their operation signs, so that middle school students who may require lower-level practice will not feel as  though they are being labeled elementary school students.",23,mtms2010-02-366a,,

The sentence should read, “When discussing similar figures, I refer to the Hot Wheels activity and note that similar figures have the same shape, but not necessarily the same size.”",25,mtms2010-02-366a,,
