11,Math Rules Prompt Reflection on Teachers Identity,"The evolving nature of teachers’ professional identities can be examined through teachers’ written reflections about their participation in professional development (Bjuland, Cestari, and Borgersen 2012). In our ongoing professional development project, we had the opportunity to work with a group of teachers who ",11,Math Rules Prompt Reflection on Teachers Identity
12,Math Rules Prompt Reflection on Teachers Identity,"In our work with teachers in professional development, we found that teachers’ professional identities influenced their self-efficacy and professional growth as they progressed through their careers. We adopt the notion of professional identity as the way a teacher sees himself or herself as a professional (da Ponte and Chapman 2008), as evidenced through interacting with colleagues and reflecting on practice. We believe that professional identity has a significant influence on teachers’ current and future practices. Our notion of identity is also influenced by Sfard and Prusak’s (2005) work, which characterizes a person’s identity in two ways––actual identity, or the current state of one’s identity, and designated identity, or who the teacher hopes to become now or in the future. Learning through professional development is believed to help teachers close the gap between actual and designated identities. We apply these conceptions of identity in our professional development work with mathematics teachers.",12,Math Rules Prompt Reflection on Teachers Identity
13,Math Rules Prompt Reflection on Teachers Identity,"were particularly insightful. These teachers shared written reflections about their thinking, prior experiences, and changing self-awareness of their mathematics practice. ",13,Math Rules Prompt Reflection on Teachers Identity
14,Math Rules Prompt Reflection on Teachers Identity,"In one of our sessions, teachers were  provided the Mathematics Teaching in the Middle School’s November 2015 feature article, “12 Math Rules That Expire in the Middle Grades,” by Karp, Bush, and Dougherty (2015). This article presented “rules” that are often taught to students in elementary and middle-grades classrooms, but eventually “expire” in that they often do not apply as students learn more complex mathematics. These rules are often taught as mathematical truths and become the mathematics that students remember without having explored the mathematics behind the rules. This increases the danger of students developing a shallow understanding of mathematical concepts and seeing mathematics as a series of rules to follow. Such rules fail to transfer to more complex mathematics that students encounter in high school, and students are forced to unlearn what they thought to be true.",14,Math Rules Prompt Reflection on Teachers Identity
15,Math Rules Prompt Reflection on Teachers Identity,"In our professional development  sessions, we strive to create a safe environment in which teachers are encouraged to ask questions about the mathematics, take risks, and make mistakes. In each session, a diverse group of 40 K–grade 12 teachers ",15,Math Rules Prompt Reflection on Teachers Identity
16,Math Rules Prompt Reflection on Teachers Identity,"Some rules fail to transfer to more  complex mathematics that students encounter in high school.  gather to solve challenging mathematical problems collaboratively, followed by discussions around pedagogical issues that may have connections to the problems. Teachers differ widely in terms of their years of classroom experience, from 1 through 30+ years, and in their work settings, from large rural public schools to urban elite private schools. We convene for eight Saturdays, once a month during the school year. Teachers have the opportunity to earn professional development credits by completing a learning portfolio in which they include evidence from their classroom practice and reflections about how their learning in the professional development applied to their instruction. ",16,Math Rules Prompt Reflection on Teachers Identity
17,Math Rules Prompt Reflection on Teachers Identity,"We recently used the article, “12 ",17,Math Rules Prompt Reflection on Teachers Identity
18,Math Rules Prompt Reflection on Teachers Identity,"Math Rules That Expire,” as an impetus for teachers to reflect on their experiences as mathematical learners and as teachers of mathematics. The article served as a framework for teachers to consider the limitation of the “rules” they routinely teach. During the session, teachers were given time to read the article and discuss in small groups (a) a rule to which they felt connected, and (b) why they selected the rule. Teachers were then asked to construct their own rule that expires, using Karp, Bush, and Dougherty’s (2015) suggested process: 1.  State the rule.",18,Math Rules Prompt Reflection on Teachers Identity

22,Math Rules Prompt Reflection on Teachers Identity," Teachers recognized the topics mentioned in the article, such as using  keywords to solve word problems, and shared this in small groups. Teachers also discussed being surprised about not having questioned the legitimacy of the rules they had adopted in their teaching. By considering the “expiration dates,” the teachers became aware of the limitations set when instruction focused on mathematics as a set of rules to memorize. Although teaching students a quick rule may be convenient for efficiently attacking a set of problems, this usefulness may not endure as students advance in the study of mathematics. ",22,Math Rules Prompt Reflection on Teachers Identity
23,Math Rules Prompt Reflection on Teachers Identity,"This activity prompted a surge of  energy because it encouraged teachers to confront aspects about their own mathematics knowledge and teaching practices. The impact from this activity appeared to have a lasting effect on teachers. Our professional development spans eight days and we incorporate a variety of pedagogical activities. Yet, when given the opportunity to reflect more deeply on any activity from the professional development, more than half of our teachers wrote about this activity. Their writing revealed how the article prompted teachers to consider how they may be teaching mathematics that misleads students from learning the underlying mathematical concepts.",23,Math Rules Prompt Reflection on Teachers Identity
24,Math Rules Prompt Reflection on Teachers Identity,"In their reflections, teachers reported that this activity raised their awareness about how teaching certain procedures or presenting mathematics in certain ways could become potentially problematic for their students’ later learning. Teachers also commented on how they would make changes in their instruction. For example, to the rule, “A solution to an equation must always be in the form x = ___,” one teacher wrote,",24,Math Rules Prompt Reflection on Teachers Identity
25,Math Rules Prompt Reflection on Teachers Identity,"The ease that the rule provides  today will cause headaches down the line. . . . Awareness of these “rules” is the first step, and now that I am privy to it, I need to make the concerted effort to talk about  and demonstrate equations in  different formats. That’s not such a hard change, but it’s one I wasn’t always conscious of. ( Joan, teacher)",25,Math Rules Prompt Reflection on Teachers Identity
26,Math Rules Prompt Reflection on Teachers Identity,"Joan acknowledged that presenting students with equations formatted with x always on the left side of the equal sign might distract students from recognizing the equal sign as being a relational symbol in other contexts. Although seeing equations with a calculation problem on the left followed by an equation symbol and the answer on the right might be a convention students learn in the earlier grades, working with problems in only this format can lead to misconceptions about equality. Joan’s realization of how such a seemingly small aspect of her mathematics instruction might have a great impact on students’ future learning is apparent in her reflection. Joan also highlighted the idea of becoming aware of something she had not realized before in her practice, a construct central to developing her practice and professional identity. ",26,Math Rules Prompt Reflection on Teachers Identity
27,Math Rules Prompt Reflection on Teachers Identity,"For some teachers, the ideas from this article raised their awareness of mathematics that might be considered rules that expire. These ideas also allowed them to consider math that their students would engage with beyond the time spent in their classrooms and think about implications of their practice on students’ future mathematical experiences. The rule, “Use the factor rainbow to factor,” encouraged one teacher to consider the mathematics she taught in relation to what her students would grapple with in the future: ",27,Math Rules Prompt Reflection on Teachers Identity

31,Math Rules Prompt Reflection on Teachers Identity,"“rules” or strategies that we teach expire as students learn more complex concepts in middle and high school. What a mind blower! . . . I  recognized some of the rules from my own classroom. . . . I used to love the factor rainbow until I saw this explanation. However, I did not consider teaching students about non-whole-number factors, . . . I realize that some of the concepts we may be teaching short-cuts to may cause students to be confused later. (Tasha, teacher)",31,Math Rules Prompt Reflection on Teachers Identity
32,Math Rules Prompt Reflection on Teachers Identity,"In addition to eliciting a sense of awareness of their practice, the ideas in the article also prompted teachers to reflect on their own experiences as mathematical learners juxtaposed with reflections about their instructional practice. Rule five, “PEMDAS: Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally” exposed shifts in one teacher’s professional growth because it revealed how her identity as a mathematics learner led to insights for her practice:",32,Math Rules Prompt Reflection on Teachers Identity
33,Math Rules Prompt Reflection on Teachers Identity,"One rule that I remember from  my own math student days is PEMDAS: Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally. . . . Students think they must always calculate addition before subtraction because of the order of PEMDAS. This expiring rule  reminded me that in teaching students math strategies, we are building their world of mathematical ideas. And when we give them short-cuts or mnemonics, sometimes it takes the thinking out of the equation. Instead of asking what would be logical or reasonable, students follow the rule without thinking. (Carrie, teacher)",33,Math Rules Prompt Reflection on Teachers Identity
34,Math Rules Prompt Reflection on Teachers Identity,"Carrie reflected on her own mathematics learning and related this to how her students might also see the rule, and how they might be subjected to its limitations. Carrie then shared her thoughts about teaching mathematics from a broader perspective, and the implications for students’ thinking when instruction targets following such rules. Although not directly stated, it is implied that her own mathematics identity provides insight into the teaching of mathematics in general, as well as implications on student thinking. ",34,Math Rules Prompt Reflection on Teachers Identity
35,Math Rules Prompt Reflection on Teachers Identity,"Reading and discussing the  ideas in the “12 Rules That Expire” article elicited several aspects of teachers’ thoughts about their own instruction and teaching in general. Furthermore, Carrie’s insight about the way she saw herself as a mathematical learner and the implications for future practice shows that she was learning and striving for her designated identity. It is important to recognize that these teacher reflections were captured at a single moment and that alone they cannot fully provide a glimpse of a teacher’s professional identity. Nonetheless, we find great promise in having teachers write about their mathematics knowledge and teaching as a way to develop their professional identities.",35,Math Rules Prompt Reflection on Teachers Identity
