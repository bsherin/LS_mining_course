"This Essential Understanding offering presents ten essential understandings that students need to realize to fully gasp the concept of proportionality. Student examples and responses to specific questions illustrate, for example, that although students can solve problems using the crossmultiplication algorithm, they may not clearly understand proportionality. Proportional reasoning involves understanding ratios as a multiplicative comparison. ",1,mtms2010-11-254a,,
"Through a discussion of such  topics as linear functions, algebraic equations, slope, and measurement, this book illustrates the importance of proportional reasoning in preparing students for high school mathematics. It also supports the idea that proportional reasoning should be taught to students in a real-world context. They should be given an opportunity to try to think about their way of solving a problem before being given an algorithm.",2,mtms2010-11-254a,,
"To understand the concepts pre- sented, this book must be read several times. Problems are given in one section, then referred to in subsequent sections. It does not present ideas for direct use in the classroom but instead examines the content and understanding that a teacher must bring to classroom instruction. ",3,mtms2010-11-254a,,
"To emphasize the essential ideas of the book, actual student examples are provided, and important ideas are summarized at the end of each chapter. This book is informative reading for middle school and high school teachers.",4,mtms2010-11-254a,,
