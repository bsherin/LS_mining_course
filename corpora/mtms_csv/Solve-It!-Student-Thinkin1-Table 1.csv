7,Solve It! Student Thinking: Rectangles,"mMost of the sixth-grade students  whose work we present used some form of guess and check to solve this rectangular task. Some began by trying factors of 336, like Julia from Walter Stark’s class. She first suggested 2 × 168 for the dimensions of the large rectangle, but Melanie, her partner, disagreed. Melanie thought the rectangle “didn’t look that skinny.” Stark asked this group how the smaller rectangles related to the large one and what it meant for the triangles to be congruent. That question prompted students to re-examine their work. Students in another group decided that because all seven rectangles were congruent, they should divide the  336 by 7 and find the area of each of the smaller rectangles first. ",7,Solve It! Student Thinking: Rectangles
8,Solve It! Student Thinking: Rectangles,"In fact, from most of the work submitted, students appeared to  begin this problem by dividing the 336 square units by 7 to find that the area of each small rectangle was 48 square units. From there, they either chose a random guess-and-check approach or were more systematic in their approach to answering the question. For example, Katherine, from Don Jolly’s class, wrote: ",8,Solve It! Student Thinking: Rectangles
9,Solve It! Student Thinking: Rectangles,Next I had to find a logical length  for each side of the small rectangles. 2 and 24 was too drastic of a difference so I decided that out of all the other combinations of multiples 6 and 8 seemed to fit the size best. ,9,Solve It! Student Thinking: Rectangles
10,Solve It! Student Thinking: Rectangles,"Katherine did not show all the possible combinations that she considered or that the combinations met the 3:4 ratio needed. This was typical of work from many of the sixth-grade students. However, several students did a very nice job of explaining their work and showing all the possibilities systematically. For example, Dan, another student in Jolly’s classroom, first labeled his drawing (see fig. 1) and then stated:",10,Solve It! Student Thinking: Rectangles
11,Solve It! Student Thinking: Rectangles,Fig. 1 Dan’s labeled picture was accompanied by an explanation of his systematic solution process in which he explored pairs of factors of 48. ,11,Solve It! Student Thinking: Rectangles
12,Solve It! Student Thinking: Rectangles,Fig. 2 Amanda’s solution drew on the fact that opposite (or parallel) sides of a rectangle must be congruent when  labeling her large rectangle.,12,Solve It! Student Thinking: Rectangles
13,Solve It! Student Thinking: Rectangles,"To find the length and width, I wrote out sets of numbers that when multiplied together equal 48. The numbers were 6 × 8, 4 × 12, 2 × 24, 1 × 48, and 3 × 16. First I tested 6 × 8. It worked with the rule saying that 3 lengths is equal to 4 widths and then I added up for the length and width of the large rectangle the width was 14 and the length was 24 so when multiplied  they would equal 336 because 14 is  7 × 2 and 24 is 48 divided by 2. Finally I tested all the other possibilities and none of them followed the rule that 3 lengths = 4 widths, so I added up the lengths and widths from 6 × 8 and got 76 for my answer. ",13,Solve It!

14,Solve It! Student Thinking: Rectangles,"Amanda, a student in Tara  ",14,Solve It! Student Thinking: Rectangles
15,Solve It! Student Thinking: Rectangles,"McKenzie’s class, also used a systematic approach when examining the possible factors of 48. She then drew on the fact that opposite (or parallel) sides of a rectangle must be congruent when labeling her large rectangle and checking that her numbers made sense. She used circles and slashes to mark parts that were congruent, with circles representing the pieces of length 6 and slashes to mark lengths of 8 (see fig. 2). Her drawing helped her calculate the perimeter of the large rectangle in terms of the number of 6s and 8s present along the edges. ",15,Solve It! Student Thinking: Rectangles

17,Solve It! Student Thinking: Rectangles,"Nola Urban asked her sixth-grade students to fi nd creative ways to solve the problem and present their solutions. Although many of her students produced fairly standard solutions, two took creativity to the next level. One produced a fi ctional story about the rectangle breaking into pieces and needing to be reassembled, and another group produced a cartoon of  themselves solving the problem by guessing and checking their results. Although the results were entertaining, they contained essentially the same mathematical ideas presented previously. ",17,Solve It! Student Thinking: Rectangles
18,Solve It! Student Thinking: Rectangles,"A student of Sitsofe Anku,  however, produced a signifi cantly different method of solution. Doris, a fi rst-year high school student at ",18,Solve It! Student Thinking: Rectangles
19,Solve It! Student Thinking: Rectangles,"Ola Senior High of Ho, Ghana, used a strictly algebraic approach, which may be expected from a fi rst-year high school student (see fi g. 3). Doris defi ned two variables, much like Dan, but rather than reverting to guessand-check strategies, she created two equations and then used a substitution strategy to solve for the two variables. ",19,Solve It! Student Thinking: Rectangles
20,Solve It! Student Thinking: Rectangles,"After reﬂ ecting on the task, we thought of another question that would require additional thinking once students have solved the initial task. Ask students, ",20,Solve It! Student Thinking: Rectangles
21,Solve It! Student Thinking: Rectangles,What if the original rectangle was only 224 square units? ,21,Solve It! Student Thinking: Rectangles
22,Solve It! Student Thinking: Rectangles,This change would require students to move beyond thinking solely about whole numbers being possibilities for the lengths of the sides. It would also help elicit more solution strategies because all the students who used guess-and-check techniques never considered the possibility that noninteger numbers could be used. Changing the total to 224 would provide an additional opportunity to discuss the fact that not all rectangles have whole numbers for lengths and widths. ,22,Solve It! Student Thinking: Rectangles
