"challenge 5. Ms. Newton gave her class the  following guessing game: “I opened our classroom dictionary at random and wrote down a secret word. The word I picked was the fourth word on the page, but I am not telling you what page. Our dictionary has 1570 pages. I will give you 11 guesses to fi nd my word.”   a.  If Newton’s students are smart  guessers, will they be able to fi nd her word? Explain.",3,mtms2011-09-74a,,

"2. What is the maximum number of  guesses a smart guesser needs to determine any secret number between 1 and 100? Explain why that number of guesses will guarantee success.

The cartoons must include the date and the newspaper syndicate that holds the copyright.",11,mtms2011-09-74a,,
"solUtions 1.  In all these problems, a smart  guesser uses a binary procedure to eliminate half the possibilities with each guess. To guess what day in August is Kerry’s birthday, the first guess should be the 16th, which immediately eliminates half the month. Then depending on whether the birthday is earlier or later than the 16th, the next guess will again narrow the choices by half. The tree diagram shows the complete guessing scheme. For example, because 25 = 32, five doublings of 1 (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32) will span the range of numbers we are trying to guess; conversely, five halvings should allow a smart guesser to determine the number.",12,mtms2011-09-74a,,
"Note: Students must understand two important points, which they will likely want to argue:  a.  The final column in the tree  counts as a guess, although after the fourth guess they actually know with certainty that the fifth choice will be correct.",13,mtms2011-09-74a,,
"  b.  The number of guesses needed  may be less than 5 because students may get lucky and guess it sooner (for example, a number may be guessed in 2 rounds if the birthday happened to be on the 8th). Emphasize that the goal is not to be the winner with the fewest guesses but to account for the number of guesses required for a worst-case scenario. ",14,mtms2011-09-74a,,

"I used “Guess What?” to introduce seventh-grade and eighth-grade algebra 1 students to exponential functions. The five classes of students, encompassing a range of levels, had previously studied exponent rules, including negative exponents. Following a discussion of the cartoon, I attempted to guess the birthday of several students in each class, recording each guess in a data table. Invariably, after two or three successful demonstrations, they asked, “How’d you do that?” The classes completed two other similar activities in which they gathered data to look for patterns. Their homework was to make an educated guess as to how the birthday “trick” worked and then try it out.",26,mtms2011-09-74a,,
"The class completed the activity the following day. Many of the students needed guidance with determining the powers of two, and some had difficulty estimating which power of two was closest to their goal. They all enjoyed learning that many magic tricks are based on a mathematical concept. Some students created problems of their own. ",27,mtms2011-09-74a,,

"I used this activity with students in a basic seventh-grade math class to reinforce the use of problem-solving strategies. Although we had reviewed general strategies, I realized that when students were looking for a pattern or building a table, they tended to make wild guesses rather than strategic guesses. Instead of presenting this activity as a worksheet, I introduced it as a game. ",30,mtms2011-09-74a,,
"After the students read the  cartoon, we played a few rounds of a game in which the class had to guess the number I was thinking. I challenged the class to guess the number in fewer guesses, which led to a discussion of strategies. I then presented each question one at a time, and students worked in small groups to answer them and then shared their experiences with the class.  —Katie A. Hendrickson, Athens Middle School, Athens, Ohio",31,mtms2011-09-74a,,
"I introduced this activity by having students guess what month I was born (as a number 1 through 12). After we debriefed their guessing strategy, I had them guess the day of the month when I was born. Then we talked about how many guesses would be necessary to guess the year. This full-class discussion helped students engage in the activity quickly. Students enjoyed guessing one another’s birthdays and other secret numbers, so it was easy to get them to try guessing. ",32,mtms2011-09-74a,,
"Once they had practiced, they could transfer their experiences to answering the questions.",33,mtms2011-09-74a,,
"As a visual representation of  this situation, I used a long piece of adding-machine tape as a number line. After students guessed a number, I folded the tape to show the remaining possible answers. This manipulative showed students how a guess in the middle of the range of numbers would be most effective because each guess cut the possible range in half. They were able to see how a long strip of paper quickly became a very small strip.  —Dave Johnston, Luna Middle School, San Antonio, Texas otheR ideas •  Ask students to look for   patterns among the powers  of two.
