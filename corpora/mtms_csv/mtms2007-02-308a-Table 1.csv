"Using Sorting Networks for Skill Building and Reasoning “W HEN ARE WE GOING TO DO THAT  tarp thing again?” Andre’s middle school students often ask. “When you can tell me what it is properly called,”  is  his  response.  “We  should  practice  our math on the sorting network,” the students recall. This is a regular request that author Robert Andre often honors because he has found that his students truly enjoy the opportunity to walk about the classroom practicing skills and mental math rather than sit in their chairs working with pencil and paper.

"Graph  theory  is  a  contemporary  mathematics topic  that  is  rarely  taught  or  described  in  conventional mathematics curricula yet has great potential for  mathematics  teaching  and  learning.  It  would take an entire course of study to develop the content of graph theory. For the purposes of this article, the sorting  network  and  its  classroom  application  will be explored. The Geometry Standard for grades 6–8 (NCTM 2000) calls for mathematics teachers to “use visual tools such as networks to represent and solve ",2,mtms2007-02-308a,,

"problems” (Niman 1975, p. 353). Andre has used a network graph application in his classes, which allows him to meet this objective in novel ways. He personally learned about graph theory and its application in the classroom ten years ago from computer scientist Mike Fellows (for current information, see “Computer Science Unplugged” at www.unplugged .canterbury.ac.nz/).  Graph-theory  diagrams  are  often used to illustrate computer programs.",4,mtms2007-02-308a,,
"As  early  as  1975,  Niman  proposed  a  graph  theory curriculum for elementary schools, describing “its aesthetic and intuitive nature” (Niman 1975, p. 353). Andre has successfully used sorting network graphs with upper elementary, middle school, and high school students. The skills-based activities can evolve  into  richer,  higher-order  thinking  lessons. Students at all levels have responded with enthusiasm and engagement. ",5,mtms2007-02-308a,,
The Sorting Network Activity,6,mtms2007-02-308a,,
"THIS ACTIvITy INvOLvES SORTING A vARIETy OF quantities  on  a  network  graph,  such  as  decimals, fractions, and percents. It parallels the Number and Operation Standard that asks students to “work flexibly  with  fractions,  decimals,  and  percents  [and] compare and order fractions, decimals, and percents efficiently” (NCTM 2000, p. 214). Sample tasks include doing mental mathematics, such as multiplication facts, and working with variable expressions and  equations.  Initially,  Andre  drew  a  sorting  network  (bell,  Witten,  and  Fellows  1998,  p.  87)  on  a large tarp that was spread out in the middle of the  classroom  floor.  Currently,  the  sorting  network  is painted  onto  the  tarmac  on  the  playground  and  is about 30 feet by 50 feet in area. This activity enables students to move about while practicing mathematics  concepts.  Robert  initially  thought  the  sorting would be easy and that the students would find the activity boring. However, he was surprised at how even simple exercises involving multiplication facts motivated  students  when  the  students  were  removed  from  the  classroom  setting,  taken  outside, given a problem on an index card, and told to walk around and compare it with other problems. He believes these simple exercises have strengthened old material by engaging it through new methods in a new setting. Once students adjusted to the new setting, they literally began to think on their feet. ",7,mtms2007-02-308a,,
"The system is a nonplanar network that sorts six items at a time (see fig. 1). A “nonplanar network” does not lie in a flat plane. Links or edges go over or under each other rather than intersect. The students have to interpret the links as roads to follow where a link might cross, like a bridge, over another link, even though the picture on the ground looks like an intersection. Six students line up at the starting  nodes.  Each  student  is  handed  an  index  card containing an expression with a numeric value (see fig.  2). Students then follow their link to the next node. Two students end up on the same node. They compare values. The student with the larger value follows the link to the right, to the next node. The student with the smaller value follows the link to his or her left, to the next node. The same process continues until all six students have arrived at the fin-",8,mtms2007-02-308a,,

"The sorting network can be used with many lessons. Students can sort quantified exercises on index cards by walking through the network.

"Entire  classes  of  students  have  moved  through the  network.  Two  or  three  groups  of  six  students are on or moving through the network itself while the rest of the class is lined up along the edge waiting to get onto the starting nodes. The teacher or a student checks to see if the ending group had sorted  correctly.  If  so,  that  group  moves  to  join  other classmates waiting in line. If an error was made, that group has to restart.",19,mtms2007-02-308a,,
Activity Extensions,20,mtms2007-02-308a,,
"THIS  ACTIvITy  MOTIvATES  STUDENTS  TO  pRAC- tice skills. However, it can be extended to incorporate reasoning, communication, and representational thinking skills by having students develop their own sorting networks. Students are reminded that the  network  used  in  class  sorts  six  numbers  at  a time.  They  then  create  different-sized  sorting  networks (see fig. 3 for a simple sorting network that sorts two items). ",21,mtms2007-02-308a,,
"Students are challenged to draw a network that sorts three, four, or five numbers. Students are given guidelines with which to draw networks from the working example that they have used. For example, only two edges can come into one node. Why? This question causes a big debate about the idea that one can only work on two elements (numbers) at a time. When do you cross edges? A lot of trial and error occurs and questions arise when the students break into pairs and begin drawing their networks. What constitutes a working network? How do you know that it is the most efficient? Can you cross edges? Why? A lot of questions and discussion go into the construction of a network. ",22,mtms2007-02-308a,,

The problem at first glance is easy to comprehend, but the process of designing a working sorting network  is  complex.  The  problem  generates  quality discussions  and  interaction.  Students  employ  the tenets of NCTM’s Representation Standard by creating a representation of the problem and making it  work  (NCTM  2000).  It  also  involves  the  meaning of proof, which directly applies to the NCTM’s Reasoning and proof Standard. Does the network work? How do you know that it works? These questions  become  a  difficult  challenge  for  students  at this age.",24,mtms2007-02-308a,,
"Students spend a lot of time testing and analyzing one another’s networks until they get working models.  They  conclude  in  whole-class  discussion that every case of number sets, such as 1, 2, 3 and 2, 3, 1, needs to be tested for the network to work. What is the standard for proof? Students use paper models to mentally walk through the different possible  sets  of  numbers.  They  have  to  demonstrate that  their  network  functions  properly  for  different sorting cases to reach consensus that they have produced  a  working  model.  Sample  student  work  appears in figure 4 showing where the numbers move through the network.",25,mtms2007-02-308a,,
"To extend the idea, students can look for patterns and generalizations in the different-sized networks. How many nodes and links are needed in the differ- ent-sized sorting networks? This discrete topic can be used to extend this activity.",26,mtms2007-02-308a,,
