For Whom the Tolls Charge,2,mtms2013-02-392a,,
"The James W. Shocknessy Ohio Turnpike, a 241.2 mile toll road, crosses Ohio from Pennsylvania to Indiana. To use it, drivers are charged a toll, or fee, depending on how many of the road’s 241.2 miles are driven. A rate per mile is multiplied by the number of miles driven, then rounded to the nearest $0.25. Drivers can pay the toll with cash or use a prepaid E-ZPass® transponder that processes the payment electronically. The toll for a truck crossing the state is $61 cash or $35 with E-ZPass. Use this vehicle and these charges for the problems below.  transponder save Pat’s Trucking any money? 6.  The OTC advertises that a driver  can save up to 50% on tolls.
