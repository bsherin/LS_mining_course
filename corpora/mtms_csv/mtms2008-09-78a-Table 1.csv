"Thomas E. Hodges, JoAnn Cady, and R. Lee Collins uUsing visual representations, such as symbols, drawings, and graphs, helps middle  school students reason about and understand mathematics. These representations support students’ learning and help them communicate their mathematical ideas. Representations also help them organize their thinking, make connections among mathematical concepts, and model the mathematics that they see in the real world (NCTM 2000). The middle school mathematics curriculum seeks to move students in a logical progression from concrete models to drawings and pictures and finally to abstract symbols. Representations can assist students in making this transition.  table 1 Percentage of problems using each representation",3,mtms2008-09-78a,,

"One challenge facing teachers who  want to encourage students’ use of a variety of representations is choosing the resources or curriculum materials for classroom instruction. Selecting tasks that encourage students’ flexibility translating from one representation to another is also challenging. When selecting problems and activities, teachers often rely on textbooks, especially in their first few years of teaching (Cady, Meier, and Lubinski 2006). Therefore, we decided to look at the representations used in middle school textbooks. We focused on fractions, because this topic is a large part of the middle school curriculum. The textbooks we selected were Connected Mathematics (CMP), Middle Grades MathThematics (Thematics), and Glencoe’s Mathematics: Applications and Concepts Course 1 (Glencoe). (As of October 2007, this analysis included the latest editions of Thematics and CMP. We made an informal observation of the updated edition to Glencoe and found no substantive changes to warrant an updated analysis of the text.) Glencoe seemed to be a popular textbook in the middle schools with which we were familiar. As mathematics educators, we became familiar with the NSF-funded curricula, CMP and Thematics. We wanted to see if there were differences in the way that fractions were represented in these three texts. We further narrowed our focus by choosing three areas to examine: representation mode, model, and problem context.",12,mtms2008-09-78a,,
RepResentation Mode,13,mtms2008-09-78a,,
"To begin our comparison, we considered the five representation modes identified by Lesh, Post, and Behr (1987): (1) real-world contexts,  (2) pictures, (3) written language,  (4) manipulatives, and (5) symbols. Each fraction problem was reviewed and labeled with one of the five categories. However, we discovered that some problems used more than one representation. Therefore, some problems were given more than one label. We used percentages to compare the representation modes used in the texts. The most common representation used was symbols; manipulatives were rarely used in any of the three textbooks (see table 1). A closer look at the table shows that CMP more evenly addresses four of the representation modes, namely, symbols (58 percent), written language (32 percent), pictures (27 percent), and real-world contexts (27 percent). A much lower percentage of problems is represented using written language, pictures, and real-world contexts in Glencoe and Thematics. To us, these  numbers suggest that students would have fewer opportunities to explore fractions in these categories unless teachers use resources in addition to the textbook. ",14,mtms2008-09-78a,,
"The high percentage of problems  using symbols might suggest that the textbook authors are encouraging students to use symbols, and thus, encouraging abstract thinking. Although the middle school mathematics curriculum serves as a bridge between the concrete experiences of the elementary school and the more abstract curriculum of the high school mathematics classroom, we question this use of symbolism, especially since few problems in each of the textbooks used manipulatives or suggested that students use manipulatives. Bruner (1964) suggests that learners progress through three stages of representation: using manipulatives, using pictures or drawings, and then advancing to symbols. One might, therefore, assume that the use of manipulatives should be encouraged to introduce concepts. Pictures would be used to develop concepts, followed by a progression to symbols as the concepts are mastered. When 89 percent or 95 percent of the problems use symbols, it would not seem that one is bridging from the concrete to the abstract. ",15,mtms2008-09-78a,,

"Symbols, real-world  contexts thought it necessary to compare the number of problems in each textbook that used more than one representation. The problems labeled as using multiple representations suggested or encouraged several different representations either when students solved the problem or when the problem was presented in the book. ",29,mtms2008-09-78a,,
"For example, consider problem 1 from Thematics in table 2. A diagram is used to present the problem. Students are then expected to translate their thinking about the two samples of trout into written language. Thus,  the problem was represented one way, but the students’ solutions are represented in another. The juice- consumption problem from CMP serves as another example. The problem presents the fractions as lengths on a bar chart, which requires students to translate the picture representation to symbolic form, determine a solution, and then translate the solution into written language based on the context. ",30,mtms2008-09-78a,,
Table 3 shows that at least 70 percent of the problems in each textbook used only one representation mode. ,31,mtms2008-09-78a,,
"In all three books, the majority of the problems using one representation used the symbolic mode. Most of these problems were also void of context. CMP had a much higher percentage of problems that used three or more representations, thus offering students more opportunities to use a variety of representations. Since so many of the problems in all three texts use only one representation, encouraging student to translate among them may be difficult to achieve without adapting instruction or using other resources.",32,mtms2008-09-78a,,
Model,33,mtms2008-09-78a,,
"Models can help students clarify developing ideas (see table 4). In this article, we use the term model to refer to manipulatives or drawings. Van de Walle (2007) suggests three different models for representing fractions: area or region, set, and length. We felt it was important to consider models when comparing textbooks, because each model brings a unique perspective to the idea of fractional parts. For example, when using the set model, students tend to focus on the number of objects in the set or subset. Therefore, the teacher’s role is to focus students’ attention on the number of equal sets in the whole (Van de Walle 2007) to identify the fractional part. In addition, referring to a collection of objects as a single entity makes set models difficult for students to comprehend. Yet the set model encourages connections to real-world contexts that use discrete objects. It also connects easily with ratio concepts. In contrast, length models use lines that are subdivided or materials that are compared based on length. For students, placing a number on a number line is very different from comparing one length with another. Therefore, a number line becomes a sophisticated length model (Bright et al. 1988). When students place numbers on a number line, they are indicating the distance to the labeled point from zero. No matter which model is used, it is important for students to be given opportunities to partition regions, lengths, and sets in addition to identifying fractional parts with models that are already partitioned (Mack 2001).",34,mtms2008-09-78a,,
Cramer and Henry (2002) recommend the use of models when studying rational numbers. Yet all three textbooks had a high percentage of problems in which a model was not provided or where students were not encouraged to make or use a model (see table 5). CMP used length models such  table 3 Percentage of problems using multiple representations number of Representations,35,mtms2008-09-78a,,

"NCTM (2000) advocates using problems that are set in real-world contexts. Others suggest that the context of the  problem may enhance or hinder understanding (Brown, Collins, and Duguid 1989). When students translate real-world contexts to drawings and symbols, they have a better chance of connecting new ideas to their existing knowledge. Explaining their representations through oral or written language also enhances their understanding. However, if students are not familiar with the context of the problem, they may have difficulty translating among representations and solving the problem  table 6 Percentage of problems in context context",57,mtms2008-09-78a,,

"Glencoe 4.4% 95.6% (Lesh, Post, and Behr 1987). Therefore, in each of the three textbooks, we decided to compare the contexts to see if they differed and if they were familiar to middle school students. ",62,mtms2008-09-78a,,
"In each textbook, over 75 percent  of the fraction problems lacked a context (see table 6). In our coding schema, the absence of a context often suggested that the problem also used symbols to represent fractions. ",63,mtms2008-09-78a,,
"For example, students might be  asked to order the following fractions from least to greatest: 2/5, 2/3, 4/9, 1/2. This problem does not have a context, since the fractions do not represent any real-world numbers, and it uses only symbols. Without a picture, or suggestion for use of a manipulative, the problem also lacks a model (area, set, or length). Our first reaction was to conclude that the lack of a context inhibits the use of representations. After further reflection, we conjectured that a context might suggest a particular model or representation. In contrast, the problem without context allows students to choose their own representation. In the example above in which fractions are ordered from least to greatest, students may create their own real-world context, then choose the appropriate area, set, or length model to represent these fractions. However, students who lack prior experiences using models to solve problems set in real-world contexts may limit themselves to using a single mathematical model or a symbolic representation mode to solve the problem. We did find that the “Investigations” in CMP and the introductory problems in Thematics were set in context. These  contextual tasks were designed to help students begin to make sense of a new mathematical concept. Problems void of context appeared in the practice or homework sections of these two texts. In Glencoe, only 34.2 percent of the introductory problems were set in real-world contexts. The contexts that occurred most frequently involved money, cooking, shopping, and sharing, which are familiar to most middle school students.  iMplications FoR pRactice",64,mtms2008-09-78a,,
"Our results indicate that if teachers use the intended textbook as their only source for both content and pedagogical approaches, then students using each of these texts would receive different classroom instruction, especially in their exposure to a variety of representations. For example, students using CMP would more likely be exposed to problems from the representation modes of written language and drawings. Students would see more problems using two representation modes using CMP (17 percent) and Glencoe (18 percent) than those using Thematics (9 percent). CMP and Glencoe students are also more likely to see problems set in real-world contexts. These contextualized problems were used to introduce concepts in CMP and Thematics, whereas Glencoe’s contextualized problems were at the end of the chapter as an application of learned skills. However, the use of multiple representations to support students’ learning advocated by NCTM is missing from the majority of the problems in all three texts, as are activities using manipulatives. Therefore, it is up to teachers to encourage  students to use and reflect on their use of representations, since evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of various representations for a particular problem enhances students’ understanding. The following list outlines several possibilities for teachers who are looking for resources that provide opportunities to explore fraction concepts using representations:",65,mtms2008-09-78a,,
"Require more than one representation. As students complete tasks, have them use more than one representation. For example, problem 3 from Glencoe (see table 2) asks students to provide the answers in symbolic form. Since the problem context suggests a length model, students could be asked to use a drawing (or number line) to represent wings that measure the given lengths, in addition to their symbolic solution. The number line and the symbolic solution can be accompanied by a written explanation of their thinking. Thus, three of the representations modes identified by Lesh, Post, and Behr are used: drawings, symbols, and written language. By requiring students to use multiple representations when solving problems, each text can be used effectively to support students’ understanding of fraction concepts. ",66,mtms2008-09-78a,,
"Start with contextual tasks. When you have to or want to develop your own tasks, begin with one that is set in a context familiar to middle school students. If the text you are using does not introduce the concept using a context, look to see if there are contextual problems at the end of a lesson. Once students have had the opportunity to explore problems in a context, move to problems without a context. Beginning with contextual tasks allows students to use a variety of fraction models and to choose which fraction model makes sense to them when solving problems without a context. It is also aligned with Bruner’s theories on learning.",67,mtms2008-09-78a,,
"Have students critique representations. When students explain and critique their own representations, their mathematical understanding is enhanced. Comparing and contrasting representations to determine the strengths and weaknesses of each in relation to the problem being solved also enhances students’ understanding. This analysis can be done with any textbook being used.",68,mtms2008-09-78a,,
"Use manipulatives. Although the  three textbooks do not encourage the use of manipulatives, these materials give students the opportunity to physically represent fractions by providing concrete representations for abstract concepts. As their understanding develops, they will move to drawings and then symbols. Teachers and students can make their own fraction strips from paper. Commercially available materials include fraction towers, pattern blocks, multilink cubes, Cuisenaire rods, and color tiles. These manipulatives often come with resource books of suggested activities. When manipulatives are not available for use or when teachers wish to make a transition from concrete manipulation by hand to a visual representation prior to symbolic representations, the National Library of Virtual Manipulatives (nlvm.usu.edu/en/nav/vlibrary .html) offers options for activities using virtual manipulatives. Students represent fraction concepts with manipulatives such as pattern blocks and fraction circles. Another Web site containing pattern block activities is “No Matter What Shape Your Fractions Are In” by Cynthia Lanius (math.rice.edu/~lanius/Patterns/).",69,mtms2008-09-78a,,

Each of these resources provides  activities that use alternate representations for developing fraction concepts. In addition to NCTM, ETA/Cuisenaire’s Super Source and the Activities Integrating Mathematics and Science (AIMS) Web site offer resources that are consistent with the vision of the NCTM’s Standards (2000). ",71,mtms2008-09-78a,,
"Requiring students to use more than one representation to solve a problem is a simple way to encourage the use of representations, no matter what textbook is being used. However, to supplement your current text, consider the following questions when evaluating curricular resources: 1.  How are fractions concepts intro- duced? Do students investigate and explore introductory concepts or do teachers demonstrate procedures? 2.  What opportunities do students have to use teacher-made, commercial, or virtual manipulatives?  3.  Are the problems set in real-world  contexts that are familiar to students? Do the contexts encourage the use of representations? 4.  Are students encouraged to create  their own drawings? If drawings are used, do those drawings include a variety of models (set, area/region, length)? 5.  Do students use or create number lines on which they place fractions? 6.  How much time is spent developing fraction concepts versus procedures? Are drawings or manipulatives used to develop concepts or practice procedures? Do these drawings and manipulatives come before symbolic forms of representation? Do they support transitions or connections between various representations? conclUsion",72,mtms2008-09-78a,,
"We hope this information assists teachers and district curriculum specialists in making educational decisions regarding the use of a chosen textbook. The curricular decisions that teachers make are significant when developing students’ ability to use a variety of representations. To support students in their mathematical thinking and understanding, teachers can foster an environment in which students solve problems using multiple representations; it is also one in which students feel comfortable reflecting on and critiquing others’ representations. As we have found, textbooks offer  students varying access to different representations. Therefore, for students to be introduced to a variety of representations, teachers must design and select learning opportunities that take full advantage of the benefits of each form. Once students use a variety of representations, the teacher’s role becomes one of interpreting their work. Consequently, teachers’ listening and questioning skills play a role in understanding the representations created by students. Ultimately, however, students should progress to conventional representations, such as those in textbooks. Thus, the teacher “has an important role in helping middle-grades students develop confidence and competence both in creating their own representations when they are needed to solve a challenging problem and in selecting flexibly and appropriately from an extensive repertoire of conventional representations” (NCTM 2000, p. 285).
