28,Math Warm-ups on a Cold Day - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,2.F = 9/5C + 32. The formula for degrees Fahrenheit can be derived by following a step-by-step progression from C = 5/9(F  32). See the sample below:,,

Some students may decide by trying, say, 101F  38C versus 101C  38F to see which one seems correct (based on the formula or based on their sense of temperature). Other students might reason that 101C would not be shown on a thermometer because it is higher than the temperature at which water would boil, so the left side must be Fahrenheit. Others might say that Celsius degrees have to have a wider interval than Fahrenheit degrees because 100 of them cover the same distance as 212  32, or 180, Fahrenheit degrees (from   waters freezing point to the boiling point).",,

53,Math Warm-ups on a Cold Day - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"This cartoon, and many of the questions, were submitted by Andy Reeves, car@mail.usf.edu, University of South Florida, St. Petersburg, retired.",,
54,Math Warm-ups on a Cold Day - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Although we had said, Enough is enough! to the 20132014 winters snow, all my eighth-grade algebra students and my Math Club enjoyed this activity. We warmed up (pun intended) by reading and discussing the cartoon. Reading comprehension and critical thinking had been a focus for our middle school, so when asked what was meant by I cant feel my hands, every class responded that the hands were numb. This warmed them up for the Jumble.",,
55,Math Warm-ups on a Cold Day - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The students completed all problems without the use of a calculator. Initially, when a few did not find an integer as the answer, they worried that they had made a mistake.",,
56,Math Warm-ups on a Cold Day - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Problem 2 proved challenging for some, particularly the fifth-grade and sixth-grade Math Club students. Some students were confused by the fraction and the parentheses. Student volunteers helped out by sharing different strategies. We look for opportunities to practice transforming equations to isolate a variable. Our science teachers appreciate reinforcing this skill, and the new version of the SAT will have an added emphasis on the manipulation of equations.",,
57,Math Warm-ups on a Cold Day - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Problems 4 and 5 provided another chance to support conclusions. A lively debate occurred in two classes over problem 5. They really began to Think Metric! as they defended their positions.,,
58,Math Warm-ups on a Cold Day - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Each class concluded the activity  with a discussion about why we still have two measurement systems and why we need to learn to convert. Many did not know that the United States had tried to go metric in the 1970s. All classes decided that it might be time to try again.,,
59,Math Warm-ups on a Cold Day - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Before doing the Jumble, we discussed how to complete it (although each class had a few students who frequently work the puzzles). I pointed out that although some words such as STOP are anagrams, there is only one way to rearrange the letters that will form a real word. The class enjoyed doing the Jumble, and it clearly was not a distraction to the rest of the activity. When one student asked if and why she had to do the Jumble, another student was quick to point out that flexibility of thinking and attention to detail are important in math. It is important that students leave my class in June knowing that math is not just about numbers.",,

63,Math Warm-ups on a Cold Day - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I used this cartoon with my sixth-grade class. It was a good exercise and required them to combine many of the concepts that we have learned throughout the year. They knew that Celsius and Fahrenheit were two ways to measure temperature, so we were able to move directly into the activity. We completed the activity sheet in one class period.",,
64,Math Warm-ups on a Cold Day - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Before the students could answer problem 1, they needed a prompt to put the 32 degrees into the formula. I also reminded them to use order of operations and how to multiply fractions. Many students failed to round to the tenth, so this gave me another opportunity to clear up misunderstandings about rounding. Some of the students thought that the statement rounding to the nearest tenth meant that is where you stop calculating.",,
65,Math Warm-ups on a Cold Day - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We did problem 2 together as a class because it gave me a chance to lead them through solving an equation for a variable. They have had experience solving equations for a variable, but none this complicated.",,

69,Math Warm-ups on a Cold Day - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I tried this Cartoon Corner activity with a very small class of nonalgebra eighth graders. It was just about perfect for them. Not too easy but doable. I let them work with a partner; otherwise, they might have been frustrated. They were allowed to use calculators, so problems 1 and 3 were good how-to-use-a-calculator problems.",,
70,Math Warm-ups on a Cold Day - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I had to help everyone with problem 2. We had not solved many equations in terms of a variable, although we had solved by multiplying by the reciprocal and adding, so students understood when I worked through the problem with them. This is a good problem.",,
71,Math Warm-ups on a Cold Day - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Students were confused by problem 4, but I liked it. I asked them to extend the thermometer to show   20 on the left and 0 on the right, and that helped. I appreciate the fact that MTMS did not show those numbers because my students need to figure things out on their own.",,
72,Math Warm-ups on a Cold Day - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Some students had never worked through a Jumble, whereas others had some experience with one. The Jumble was challenging, but the students shared answers and managed to figure it out. Overall, we enjoyed having the Jumble as part of the Cartoon Corner. The students spent about thirty minutes on the cartoons activity sheet.",,

This activity provided a good review of the relationship between the two systems of temperature measurement and will provide an opportunity to collect and analyze data.,,
