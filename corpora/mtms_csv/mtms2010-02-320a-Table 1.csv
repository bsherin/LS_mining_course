"After constructing and conducting a survey,  students explored concepts of statistics,  “Our School as 100 Students” project replicated this work by exploring school statistics and showing how the school would look with only 100 students, maintaining proportions. It culminated with a video showcasing the school as 100 students, which displayed the results of a survey that the students designed and conducted. The project objectives involved both statistical understanding and social awareness (table 1). Our primary goal was to enhance students’ understanding of statistics by providing an engaging project that explored their world. The underlying goal was to illustrate to students how their world, in the form of middle school, encompassed students from different backgrounds. ",3,mtms2010-02-320a,,
"Placing students in a collaborative environment involving project-based learning may enable them to overcome misconceptions of probability (Shaughnessy 1977) and enhance the learning of statistics concepts ( Jones 1991). This type of structure may also encourage debate and discussion, which can promote student engagement and new thinking while cultivating social development (Latour 1987). ",4,mtms2010-02-320a,,
"The project explores how our world would look with only 100 people, if proportionally scaled. The idea is based on work from the 100 People Village (100 People Foundation), which uses world statistics to “educate, entertain and inspire participants to learn more about world geography, culture, language, religion, music and our shared resources.” The  student Project",5,mtms2010-02-320a,,
"The activities that were part of this project are listed in figure 1. It culminated in a video, made by the students, to highlight “Our School  as 100 Students.” To work on this  project, students needed to understand percentages, ratios, and proportions and be familiar with their meaning and importance. We used class time for discussions and group work, which promoted student engagement and critical thinking, and we tried to limit the amount of lecture and instruction that we gave to students.",6,mtms2010-02-320a,,
"On day 1, we introduced the project by having students watch the 100 People video (www.miniature-earth.",7,mtms2010-02-320a,,
"com) (The Miniature Earth Project 2001), which reports a portion of 2001 world statistics, such as demographics, living conditions, and educational backgrounds. The video shows how the world would look if only 100 people populated it, with the proportions kept constant. After watching the video, we discussed the message and how it applied to students. To encourage the students to examine the video’s mathematical and statistical concepts, we asked why the producers preferred to explore a 100-person world. We also discussed the statistical results from the video, which seemed to surprise the students, since the numbers did not seem to fit with their mental model of the world.",8,mtms2010-02-320a,,
" Their middle school demographics were 73 percent non-Hispanic White, 16 percent Hispanic, 6 percent African American, and 4 percent multiracial/other. They resided in a county with an average per-capita income of approximately $30,000. As a result, the world statistics that 61 people out of 100 would be Asian and that 53 people would have an average daily expense of $2 a day (The Miniature Earth Project 2001) was a surprise.

Day 8: Discuss the project in class differences between their view and the statistical view of the world. ,22,mtms2010-02-320a,,
"Students felt the discrepancy  between their view and the statistical view of the world was because many of them had not traveled outside the United States, meaning that they had not seen much of the world and world population. We asked students to think about their school as their world and to write their thoughts about school demographics and student populations (e.g., the percent of students involved in athletics and music, and the number of siblings the typical student had). This prompt led to a provocative discussion with students concerning their school and provided a segue to the student project: to explore the school statistics and create of video showing their school as 100 students. ",23,mtms2010-02-320a,,
"At this juncture, we asked students  to work in pairs to write what steps  and methods they thought would be needed for this project. At a rudimentary level, most student pairs were able to list the steps needed to complete the project, stating that they had to create and administer a survey, analyze the percentage of student responses of each question, and use the results to create the video. At the end of day 1, we held a group discussion and created a basic timeline of activities on the board, showing what they would be working on each day of the project. To develop critical-thinking skills  and promote inquiry learning, students used day 2 and day 3 to create the survey and determine the survey procedures. In groups of three, they generated questions they felt were appropriate and discussed survey methods. We reminded students that the questions would need to be tested, which also led to students determining how they wanted to analyze the data. For ease of use, they suggested questions that were yes-no or multiple choice, since they would be using tally marks during data entry. We also encouraged them to ask insightful and significant questions, two of which resulted in “Do you judge others by their appearance?” and “Do you plan to go to college?” ",24,mtms2010-02-320a,,
"At the end of the class, each group had to suggest one survey question to the class (approximately ten questions were written on the board). After all  groups provided their question, the class discussed the merits of each and selected five questions to contribute to the survey. The five classes taught by the instructors yielded a survey of twenty-five questions. Figure 2 lists a few of their suggestions. ",25,mtms2010-02-320a,,
"On day 3, we guided students  through two activities showing how bias can affect survey results. In the first activity, we wanted students to critically analyze the wording of the survey questions. To open the activity and explore potential survey question bias, each student received one of two questions, with one question printed on blue paper and the other printed on red paper.",26,mtms2010-02-320a,,
Blue-paper question: Would you prefer to go see an action-packed movie with your friends or work for your neighbor?  a. Go to the movie b. Work for your neighbor,27,mtms2010-02-320a,,
Red-paper question: Would you prefer to go see a movie or make $50 for two hours of work babysitting your neighbor’s well-behaved child?  a. Go to the movie b. Work for your neighbor,28,mtms2010-02-320a,,
"Initially, neither question was read aloud, and students were not to show others what was on their paper. We simply asked all students which response they preferred. Most of the students with the blue paper responded (a). Most of students with the red paper responded with (b). Students then read aloud the questions. In hearing the separate questions, the students noted that these questions were actually the same, either go to the movies or work for the neighbor, but one question made the movie sound more appealing and the other made working a better option. As a group, we discussed how the wording of the question could influence how others respond, which can skew ",29,mtms2010-02-320a,,
Fig. 2 Students asked twenty-five survey questions. the questions shed light on the sorts of topics that students found important.,30,mtms2010-02-320a,,

Yes, bullied in the past c. No, never 7.  Do you usually (5 or more days  a week) take a shower/bath? a. Yes b. No 3.  have you ever bullied someone  8.  Do you/have you ever wished  else? a. Yes, am bullying now b. Yes, have bullied in the past c. No, never you were someone else? a. Yes, very often b. Yes, not often c. No 4.  Do you feel disliked or not   9.  have you ever done anything  accepted by your peers? a. Yes, very often b. Yes, not often c. No 5.  Do you wash your hands after  you use the restroom? a. Yes, always b. Yes, most of the time c. Yes, not often d. No, never illegal? a. Yes b. No 10. how happy are you with your  family life? a. always happy b. happy most of the time c. Not often happy d. Not happy the results of a survey. Together, the class rewrote the question to make it more neutral. Following this activity, student pairs analyzed the wording of the survey questions and revised any biased or unclear question. ",31,mtms2010-02-320a,,
"To end the class, we explored  sample and population statistics, with the goal of determining survey procedures. We provided this example.",32,mtms2010-02-320a,,
" City planners were thinking of building a new baseball park, but they did not know how the citizens would feel about building it. The planners were weighing four options for surveying and determining the need for a new baseball park: 1.  Go door-to-door and try to survey  the entire city (approximately 85,000 people).  2.  Go to a local baseball park and  survey all the users.  3.  Make telephone calls to every  tenth name in the telephone book, and survey a portion of the city’s population.  4.  Go to a local swimming pool and  survey all the users.",33,mtms2010-02-320a,,
"We said it was the students’ job to explain to the city planners which survey method would be most appropriate. For ease, the students voted by a show of hands for the survey method that they thought would be suitable  to participate in the data entry and tallying of approximately 525 surveys. We gave students a printed sheet on which to record their data. After each group finished, we combined their results with the total results from all groups. ",34,mtms2010-02-320a,,
"Following the data entry, we placed  students into small groups and gave each group two or three questions from the survey. These groups would be responsible for reporting the outcome in the video. Although the final results would not be available until the following day, we wanted students to brainstorm ideas for their portion of video, such as writing a script for a short skit or finding an appropriate picture to show their results.",35,mtms2010-02-320a,,
"By day 6, the data were collected and amalgamated, and each student group calculated the results they needed for their two to three video questions. They also finalized their plans for their portion of the video. In calculating the results, most students used percentages, but others used ratios or proportions. The only requirement for results was that it had to be reported in reference to the 100-student world. ",36,mtms2010-02-320a,,
"Groups were free to display their results by whatever method they thought would show them most effectively. One group reported a statistic as “1 in 10 students have lost a close family member,” whereas a group in another class reported it as “10 students have lost a close family member.” ",37,mtms2010-02-320a,,
"During day 6, we also asked the students to consider how to use the numbers and results appropriately. We reminded students that they would most likely have more numbers and statistics than were feasible to place in the video. As a result, we said it might be appropriate to focus on the most relevant and most significant portions of the results. For example, these were some of their results:  •	 21	students	are	an	only	child.",38,mtms2010-02-320a,,
•	 38	students	have	1	sibling.,39,mtms2010-02-320a,,
•	 15	students	have	2	siblings.,40,mtms2010-02-320a,,
•	 10	students	have	3	siblings.,41,mtms2010-02-320a,,
•	 6	students	have	4	siblings.,42,mtms2010-02-320a,,
•	 4	students	have	5	siblings.,43,mtms2010-02-320a,,
•	 6	students	have	6	or	more	siblings.,44,mtms2010-02-320a,,
"Although the list contained the entirety of the results, we encouraged students to write their results more succinctly and clearly. We wanted students to explore and decide what results needed to be reported. At a conceptual level, this introduced students to an analysis of distribution. To illustrate our message, we reminded students of the 100 People video statistic that 53 percent of the world population lives on $2 daily. We asked why they thought the video producers used $2 as the only reported living expense. Students explained that 53 percent was a majority of the population, which was why it was important. As a follow-up question, we asked if it would have been better to specifically report how many people lived off $1, $2, $3, or $4, and so on, and report all the data and the whole population. ",45,mtms2010-02-320a,,
"This encouraged students to think  about why the one summarizing statistic of 53 percent or $2 might have been used. One student said that showing each result might not be as meaningful because as a viewer he would become confused comparing numbers. It would be difficult to see that 53 percent, over half the world population, lives off $2 per day. The $2, to him, was important because this was the approximate cost of his school lunch, leaving him no extra money for other meals or expenses, such as clothes and electricity. This prompted students to think about how to effectively combine their results and determine what message they were sending as the results were displayed. From the discussion, one group decided to show the high, low, and average number of siblings, leading to data reported in this way: for this endeavor. The overwhelming choice by students was to survey the entire population; they felt it would be the most appropriate because the city would then know everyone’s opinion. After the voting, the class weighted the advantages and disadvantages of each method and introduced the concepts of population, biased sample, and random sample, noting how the survey methods can affect results and costs. We also used these points to prompt students to think about how they should administer their survey, explaining that their costs were not necessarily monetary but involved time. The students concluded that the survey should— 1.  be administered to all students in  the middle school; 2.  be anonymous; and 3.  be taken in the homeroom, where it would not interfere with other classes. ",46,mtms2010-02-320a,,
"On day 4 of the project, we did  not work on it in class. Instead, students reviewed math concepts and had a study day. Participants printed, prepared, administered, and collected the surveys following the requested procedures outside of class during our free and preparation time. The main objective for day 5 was data entry. Before the class started, we placed six to eight surveys in a stack. With approximately 30 students per class and five classes, this allowed each student pair  •	 21	students	are	an	only	child.",47,mtms2010-02-320a,,
•	 63	students	have	1	to	3	siblings.,48,mtms2010-02-320a,,
•	 16	students	have	4	or	more	siblings.,49,mtms2010-02-320a,,
"On day 7, the student groups filmed their portion of the video. Each group was given approximately eight minutes to add their results to the video, either as a short video skit or as a picture overlaying the statistics. After each group’s results were combined into the one class video, the students picked music to go along with the video. We edited the final production. By the end of the day, there were five videos, one per class, which showed their school as 100 students. ",50,mtms2010-02-320a,,
"On day 8, the last day of the project,  students watched their class video and discussed the project. To further the conversation, we gave students a handout containing these questions as writing prompts:  •	 What	specific	statistics	from	the	 survey results in your class video surprised you? •	 How	did	the	video	change	your	 thoughts about your peers? •	 What	message	do	you	think	other	 students will find in the video? Teachers? Parents? •	 What	benefits	can	come	from	this	 video?  •	 What	negative	effects	could	come	 from this video? •	 What	did	you	learn	about	yourself	 and other students during this project? •	 How	will	you	apply	what	you	 learned from the project?",51,mtms2010-02-320a,,

"Showing middle school students how statistics can be applied and promoting student understanding of survey and analysis methods were dual goals  of this project. Of equal importance, however, was to encourage students’ social growth and development.",53,mtms2010-02-320a,,
"On the eighth and final day, we  asked students to think about not only the mathematics of the project but also the social implications. We were using cultural awareness as a means for exploring mathematics concepts. To open the final class discussion, we asked students to relate their statistical results from the survey to their original thoughts on school demographics and student population from day 1. This led to thoughtful dialogue on how an individual perceives his or her world. We asked students how their school statistics compared with world statistics and noted any similarities and differences. From this activity, we hoped to reiterate the concepts of sample and total population. ",54,mtms2010-02-320a,,

"We need to make sure we always remember this—we all are living, breathing human beings.",60,mtms2010-02-320a,,
"Because, in part, this project was designed to encourage student reflection, their responses provided evidence that we achieved this goal. It may cultivate in students a stronger awareness of and respect for their peers. ",61,mtms2010-02-320a,,
"In asking students how they viewed  mathematics (specifically statistics) after the project, they replied that they thought it was a much more interesting discipline. They were surprised with the amount of detail and planning that went into creating and administering a survey. They commented that even though they see statistics regularly in the newspaper and on television, they did not realize the amount of work needed to achieve quality results. ",62,mtms2010-02-320a,,
"Students also pondered the truthfulness and accuracy of surveys. Although they knew it was anonymous, they felt that some of the statistics did not make sense and that other students were not honest in filling out the survey. Some students were frustrated that others did not take the survey seriously. Others felt that the consequences of using different survey or data collection methods would be better or more accurate results. This prompted a final conversation that asked students to think about how they could have changed the project. ",63,mtms2010-02-320a,,
"From our perspective, we felt the  project could have been strengthened had more time been dedicated to exploring the math and statistics concepts in depth. Although students were able to see and discuss the concepts used throughout the project, we could have investigated some concepts more rigorously. ",64,mtms2010-02-320a,,
"For example, on days 5 and 6, we were originally planning to show how a sample of just five class surveys (approximately 105) contributed to the overall population results of the school (approximately 525). After the first class, with approximately 1/5 of the results tallied, the results may have been different from the total population results. Moreover, after each period and 105 more survey results, the students could begin to scrutinize the relationship between a survey sample and population. Showing results in this manner may also show the relationship between cost (class time dedicated to the project) and accuracy of results, both of which were items we discussed in the earlier example of city planners examining the need for a new baseball park. ",65,mtms2010-02-320a,,
"With more time, we could have  had students write how and why they chose to report their results in the video. Although each class reported the same results of the twenty-fivequestion survey, each class video was unique and showed a slightly different message. If time allowed, it would have been interesting to see why students reported their values differently. For example, one group reported that 88 students want to go to college and that 10 were undecided. Another group rounded the results and only reported that 9 out of 10 students want to go to college. Both groups stated that a majority of the students see college in their future, but one group emphasized that a number are undecided, whereas the other did not mention this. Knowing why the student groups  encouraged students to consider how the statistics shown may convey different messages. For example, the students’ video stated that 70 students (out of 100) judge others by their appearance. We asked them how these results might be interpreted. They answered that they could be interpreted in multiple ways, such as—  1.  it is okay to judge others by their  appearance because everyone is doing it; or 2.  too many people care about what others look like rather than who they are, which shows we need to think about our actions. ",66,mtms2010-02-320a,,
"Much of this final conversation centered on understanding the message of the video. In hindsight, we could have expanded on the mathematics concepts, showing students that the mathematics allowed us to see the school and its students more objectively as opposed to the subjective nature in which we normally view our world. ",67,mtms2010-02-320a,,
"In examining students’ writings, we were able to learn what societal insights students felt they gained through participating in the project:",68,mtms2010-02-320a,,
"I learned that we all have a place in this world, and there are a lot of  chose to report their results could have provided insight into how they viewed the data. Allowing students more time to investigate, rather than just discuss, the math and statistics concepts may have yielded a greater understanding of the concepts while also developing students’ critical-analysis skills.  conclusion",69,mtms2010-02-320a,,
"This project provided a gateway to several important concepts, both mathematically and socially. The discussions and final activity allowed students to reflect on past experiences and integrate their old and new knowledge to gain a more complete understanding of statistics and their world. With the changing demographics of the United States and the move toward a more global society, this project is an appropriate way to prepare students to be more statistically and culturally aware.",70,mtms2010-02-320a,,
