The student groups start with different amounts of money and earn the same amount of money each week. This makes the question of when they will have the same amount of money a simple one: never. If students do not immediately stop to reason about the situation, a teacher has two options: (1) Stop them in their work and guide them down the effi cient road or (2) step back and get a glimpse into their thinking as they take the road less traveled. This article will focus on the reasoning of four students as they make sense of a mathematical task using multiple representations.  students should engage in reasoning and sense making daily in their mathematics classes. It is often through students’ divergent thinking as they work on novel mathematical tasks that they make important mathematical connections and that teachers learn about their understandings. Creating opportunities for students to explore allows them to experience mathematics as a connected whole as opposed to viewing the subject as a series of discrete pieces of information that must be committed to memory.

11,The Road Less Traveled,"When I became a mathematics teacher, I often found myself wishing that students would take the road most traveled, or the most effi cient path to a solution. However, I have grown to appreciate and value what happens when students work to make sense of and reason about important content in the mathematical equivalent of “the road less traveled.” In doing so, these students actively develop a connected understanding of mathematics, build a sense of self-effi cacy, and give others a window into their understanding.

The first group begins with $32 and earns $27 each week by working at the school store. The second group of students starts with $18 and earns $27 per week by tutoring elementary students.  1.

They were studying linear equations in classrooms in which teachers were committed to developing student thinking, discussion, and engagement by focusing on understanding tables, graphs, and equations, and the connections among these representations. While I was working with the four students outside of their class, I had the opportunity to hear their thinking, watch them produce their written work, observe their chosen mathematical “routes,” and hear how they responded when they encountered mathematics they did not understand. Vignettes of their work on this task are in figures 2–4. As you read and view their choices of representations, consider the intellectual activity they engaged in as they reasoned and made sense of mathematics.",22,The Road Less Traveled
23,The Road Less Traveled,"While solving this problem, all four  students expressed at some point that reading closely and making sense of the problem alone would have been enough to determine that the answer was “never.” Miguel even said to Harmony, “Why didn’t we see that?” So the question that struck me was this: Would it have been better to stop them early in their solution discussion and guide them to read carefully or let them proceed? To explore this question, I began to actively look at the students’ work and explanations for evidence of their understanding and use of connections among representations. ",23,The Road Less Traveled
24,The Road Less Traveled,UNDERSTANDING CONNECTIONS AMONG REPRESENTATIONS,24,The Road Less Traveled
25,The Road Less Traveled,"One way for students to understand the connectedness of representations is to translate among pairs of mathematical representations (tables, graphs, equations, context) of a concept, as described by Lesh et al. (2000):",25,The Road Less Traveled
26,The Road Less Traveled,"A translation requires a reinterpretation of an idea from one mode of  representation to another. This  movement and its associated  intellectual activity reflect a dynamic view  of instruction and learning.  (Lesh et al. 2000, p. 450)",26,The Road Less Traveled
27,The Road Less Traveled,"In figures 2–4, students engaged in the intellectual activity of translating among representations of context, tables, equations, and graphs while finding a viable answer to the question. Students often learn how to create  representations, but making connections among the representations is something that is not necessarily emphasized (NCTM 2000). They translated from one representation to another when grappling with something puzzling within a representation, selecting from known representations to solve the problem, or checking to see if their solutions made sense. The summaries of students’ explanations of their thinking are used to illustrate each situation. ",27,The Road Less Traveled
28,The Road Less Traveled,"Grappling with Something Puzzling Throughout the vignettes, when students puzzled over something within a representation, they frequently translated to a new one. They would make a conjecture, translate to a new representation, test the conjecture in the new representation, and interpret the results. For example, when Becca tried to determine the time at which the two groups would have the same amount of money, she wrote the equation 27x + 32 = 27x + 18 (see fig. 3). Before doing any symbolic manipulation, she realized that this was “gonna be weird,” indicating that the term 27x was on both sides of the equals sign. Clearly, she knew that the common term 27x was an important feature of this equation, but she did not know how to interpret this attribute. ",28,The Road Less Traveled
29,The Road Less Traveled,For students in a similar situation without a connected understanding of ,29,The Road Less Traveled
30,The Road Less Traveled,"Fig. 3 When Becca was unsure about the meaning of 27x, she extended her table in anticipation of graphing the ordered pairs.",30,The Road Less Traveled
31,The Road Less Traveled,"Becca answered questions 1 and 2 in this way. When asked why the first rule matches the situation, she said, “Because they start off with 32 . . . and then every week they get 27. . . .”",31,The Road Less Traveled
32,The Road Less Traveled,"To find out when the two groups would have the same amount of money,  she wrote the following:",32,The Road Less Traveled
33,The Road Less Traveled,"She looked at the equation and said, “Hold on, this is gonna be a weird  one . . . because . . . this is both the same.” When asked what was the same, she said, “The 27x.” Although she realized that this was important, it seems that she did not quite know what it meant, so she said, “We could graph it, and I could see when they both cross the same thing. Or we could make a table. . . .” She started to extend her table (as shown below). ",33,The Road Less Traveled
34,The Road Less Traveled,"After realizing that she had not found the point at which the lines cross,  she said, “Or maybe it’s negative, where they cross. . . .” ",34,The Road Less Traveled
35,The Road Less Traveled,"She was asked to evaluate the difference in money earned between the two groups for various weeks. “Fourteen apart. And then right here they’re 14 apart also. . . . They’d be 14 apart each time.” When asked the question of when the two groups will have the same amount of money, she stated, “They won’t . . . ’cause parallel lines, they don’t intersect.” representations, this could be a point  of impasse. However, for Becca, translating among representations was a tool to make sense of an unfamiliar situation. ",35,The Road Less Traveled
36,The Road Less Traveled,"When she recognized that the  equation was a special case, she  refocused her attention to the table. She then extended the table she had previously produced to make sense of what was happening. After translating to a tabular representation, she realized that the difference in money between the two groups was constant from week to week. She then concluded that because this situation resulted in the same multiple of x on both sides of the equals sign, the result was that there was no solution. The next time Becca sees an equation in the form ax + b = ax + c, it is unclear whether  she will be able to conclude that there is no solution, but this experience may have begun to help her build tools to find the answer by translating to other representations. ",36,The Road Less Traveled
37,The Road Less Traveled,"Selecting a Representation for  Solving the Problem In each of the three vignettes, students communicated that they were making a choice among representations. At various times, I heard the students think aloud and weigh their options for how to proceed and select from among the representations they knew and understood. For example: •  Katrina specified that she could extend her existing table or use equations (see fig. 2). She opted to ",37,The Road Less Traveled
38,The Road Less Traveled,Fig. 4 Harmony and Miguel worked together and decided to create a new equation from the existing information.,38,The Road Less Traveled
39,The Road Less Traveled,"When given questions 1 and 2, Miguel wrote the equations, and Harmony created a table: ",39,The Road Less Traveled
40,The Road Less Traveled,Miguel explained his second equation in this way: “$27 is what they’re  making per week and $18 is what they started with. And y is what they have each week.” ,40,The Road Less Traveled
41,The Road Less Traveled,"When asked when the two groups would have the same amount of money, ",41,The Road Less Traveled
42,The Road Less Traveled,"Miguel looked at Harmony’s table and stated, “It hasn’t happened yet. . . . I know an easy way to do it. If we solve for x.” After some discussion, they wrote 27x + 32 = 27x + 18 and they (incorrectly) solved for x. The last line read x + 14 = 0 (the written work below was amended later in the task):",42,The Road Less Traveled
43,The Road Less Traveled,"Initially, they interpreted the last line of x + 14 = 0 to mean, “At 14 weeks they will be the same.” Then they extended their tables to verify this result (see below). When their tables did not match their interpretation, they checked and rechecked their math. First, they added 27 to the starting values to check their tables. Then they used their equations and substituted 14 for x to see if they got the same result. When this was inconclusive, I guided them back to their system of equations to check their work. ",43,The Road Less Traveled
44,The Road Less Traveled,"When they arrived at the last line and realized  that it should have read 14 = 0, I questioned what it meant, “Are you telling me that 14 = 0?” Harmony said, “That doesn’t make sense.” Miguel says, “They’re never going to be the same. . . . Group 1 started with 32 [dollars] and group 2 started with 18 [dollars], and they’re going up at the same rate.” I asked what this would look like, and Harmony produced this sketch: set the two equations equal to each other and solve for x.",44,The Road Less Traveled
45,The Road Less Traveled,"•  When Becca realized that the term  27x on both sides of the equation was “weird,” she indicated that she could either graph the equations or make a table. She chose a table.",45,The Road Less Traveled
46,The Road Less Traveled,•  Miguel considered the information  in Harmony’s table and then introduced an “easy” way to solve the problem by creating a new equation (see fi g. 4). ,46,The Road Less Traveled
47,The Road Less Traveled,"These instances indicate that the students were aware that there were multiple ways to use representations to answer the question. They were choosing a representation that they found effective. It was clear that the students were familiar with representations as tools to use in solving the problem, and at various points they made informed choices regarding which representation to pursue. ",47,The Road Less Traveled
48,The Road Less Traveled,Checking the Reasonableness of a Solution,48,The Road Less Traveled
49,The Road Less Traveled,"Within each vignette, students were able to verify the reasonableness of their solutions by using a different representation. Consider when Harmony and Miguel made an algebraic error that resulted in the equation x + 14 = 0 and misinterpreted the solution to be x = 14. Without prompting, they extended their table to 14 and realized that the results in their table did not confi rm that at 14 weeks the two groups would have the same amount of money. Initially, they checked and rechecked their table. When prompted to look at their equation, they revisited their symbolic work and quickly found the error. ",49,The Road Less Traveled
50,The Road Less Traveled,"Similarly, when Katrina reached a solution, she checked the reasonableness against the context. At fi rst, she said that one group had more money to start and then earned more. However, after looking at her equation, she revised her statement to refl ect  that they were earning money at the same rate. ",50,The Road Less Traveled
51,The Road Less Traveled,"These students were so focused on reasoning through the task that they continued their stance of checking and making sense of the mathematics even when they reached their answers. Rather than consider an answer as an ending point, they treated it as a conjecture for a solution, then worked to prove or refute the validity of the conjecture. ",51,The Road Less Traveled
52,The Road Less Traveled,"In all three cases, the students did not draw graphs to fi nd a solution. These four students primarily translated among the representations of context, tables, and equations to make sense of both the problem and their understanding. However, when prompted, they were able to discuss and sketch a graph that would represent the situation presented in the problem. In these cases, the students were able to use graphs as a tool to retell the story and offer visual evidence to show why their solution made sense. ",52,The Road Less Traveled
53,The Road Less Traveled,LETTING STUDENTS PROCEED,53,The Road Less Traveled
54,The Road Less Traveled,"To answer this question that was raised earlier, would it have been better to stop students early in the problem and guide them to read carefully or let them proceed? One needs to decide whether the overriding goal of having students do mathematics problems is to reach a solution or to deepen their understanding of mathematics. Because the purpose of engaging students in mathematical problems is, at least in part, to understand mathematics as a connected subject, there are merits in students taking a longer, less traveled, path to a solution. During this task, students translated among representations to make sense of questions that arose as they worked toward a solution and assessed the reasonableness of their solutions. ",54,The Road Less Traveled
55,The Road Less Traveled,"Skemp (1987) describes intellec- in which learners use fl exible plans as they test hypotheses and work toward the goal. Katrina, Becca, and Harmony and Miguel engaged in intellectual learning in that they adapted their thinking, used representations to move forward in their ideas, and refl ected on their conjectures and potential solutions to the question. Given mathematical tasks and learning environments that foster opportunities for students to translate among representations, students will develop connected understandings and strong foundations for how to read, interpret, and understand the relationships among tables, graphs, equations, and context. As their study of linear equations gives way to nonlinear equations, the connected understanding that students have of linear equations might be a foundation on which they can integrate, synthesize, and make meaning of new families of functions, thus adding to their connected understandings. ",55,The Road Less Traveled
56,The Road Less Traveled,"In addition to developing their understanding of mathematics, by allowing these students to take the road less traveled, it became clear to me that they were developing their self-effi cacy in using mathematics. Katrina, Becca, and Harmony and Miguel were confi dent in their mathematical ability. When they were presented with questions that made them unsure how to proceed, they explored alternative representations rather than claim defeat. ",56,The Road Less Traveled
57,The Road Less Traveled,"In the cases presented here, the answer to the problem was not as important as the students’ thinking as they pursued a solution. Perhaps we can allow students the room to explore the connections among representations and to take less effi cient routes on tasks that offer an effi cient solution. In the process, we will gain insight into their understandings. Are problems assigned so that  tual learning as a goal-driven activity  students fi nd an answer or for students  to reason through a process? Both. As with a walk in the woods, solving problems in math class should be as much about the journey as the destination. And that can make all the difference.",57,The Road Less Traveled
