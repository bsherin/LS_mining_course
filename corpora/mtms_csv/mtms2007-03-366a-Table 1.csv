The Future of Fractions,1,mtms2007-03-366a,,
"In the 1970s, the movement to the metric system (which has still not completely occurred in the United States) and the advent of hand-held calculators led some to speculate that decimal representation of numbers would render fractions obsolete. This provocative proposition stimulated Zalman Usiskin to write “The Future of Fractions” in 1979. He challenged this opinion by illustrating how it was based on flawed assumptions and erroneous reasoning. Some twenty-eight years later, Usiskin follows up on his fraction remarks in “Some Thoughts about Fractions.” In this work, he bolsters his previous arguments concerning the welfare of fractions and asserts that their study will remain an important part of school mathematics.",2,mtms2007-03-366a,,
