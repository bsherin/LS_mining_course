"Dewey’s concern about the simplifi ed curriculum and teaching practice  is still valid in many mathematics classrooms and among the general public. How often do we hear curriculum developers and teachers say, “I want to make math simple for students.” “The problem-solving process will be presented in a clear, step-by-step manner so that students can follow easily” is another common statement. In Math Doesn’t Suck, Danica McKellar (2007) suggests that middle school students, particularly girls, can learn mathematics well by merely following her tricks. She describes mathematics as simply a series of step-by-step procedures.",1,mtms2012-04-464a,,

"Rong-Ji ChenMore jjJohn Dewey discussed the dry school curriculum a century ago. One of  the “evils” was a simplifi ed curriculum having an outward appearance of mathematics. By the time it reached the student, “It has to undergo some modifi cation in order to shut out some phases too hard to grasp, and to reduce some of the attendant diffi culties” (1902/2008, p. 26). Dewey posited that such a simplifi ed curriculum deprived students of opportunities to experience the thought-provoking character of the accumulated wisdom found in human knowledge. As a result, “the child’s reasoning powers, the faculty of abstraction and generalization, are not adequately developed . . . the child’s logic is hampered and mortifi ed” (p. 26).",4,mtms2012-04-464a,,

"A well-planned lesson targets higherorder thinking; however, the cognitive level of the lesson is often reduced to a lower level during its implementation. Boaler and Humphreys (2005) discuss the Border problem in which students are expected to identify and represent patterns algebraically. During the lesson’s implementation, Humphreys shows a 10-by-10 grid (see fig. 2) using an overhead projector. She carefully words her question and asks students to “figure out without talking, without writing, and without counting one by one, how many unit squares were in the colored portion?” (p. 16). In this way, students are guided toward pattern generalization instead of merely finding a correct answer.",13,mtms2012-04-464a,,

"The practice of making mathematics easy by explaining every single detail and providing students with procedural directions can impede learning. By setting the stage and doing their thinking, we require minimal cognitive effort from students. As Hiebert et al. (1997) state, “By intervening too much and too deeply, the teacher can easily cut off students’ initiative and creativity, and can remove the problematic nature of the material” (p. 9). Indeed, there is a fine line between providing adequate guidance to support student thinking and allowing students to pursue their own problem-solving strategies. ",17,mtms2012-04-464a,,
"The two scenarios that follow show  how teachers provide too much help and thus downgrade the cognitive level of mathematical explorations. The first scenario involves lesson planning; the second scenario concerns lesson implementation. In each case, the teacher attempts to guide students’ thinking, but the help can actually impede their learning of in-depth mathematical concepts. What follows are strategies for maintaining quality mathematical tasks and engaging students in activities that call for significant cognitive effort. The purpose is to promote the art of being “less helpful” in teaching (Meyer 2010).",18,mtms2012-04-464a,,

"Humphreys deliberately does not  give each student a printout of the grid because she realizes that they tend to count each square one by one if a grid is on the desk. Boaler reports that another teacher gives her students their own copies of the grid. By making it easy for students, this teacher fails to move her students beyond counting. This comparison shows that the way a mathematical task is implemented determines the level of cognitive effort that students will expend.",22,mtms2012-04-464a,,
"In their book, Stein et al. (2009)  provide many cases of how task implementation influences students’ learning. They outline factors associated with the decline of high-level cognitive demands. The first factor occurs when problematic aspects of the task become routinized (e.g., students press the teacher to reduce the complexity of the task by specifying explicit procedures or steps to perform; the teacher “takes over” the thinking and reasoning and tells students how to do the problem) (Stein et al. 2009, p. 16).",23,mtms2012-04-464a,,

The teacher continued to guide the student through the process of setting up the proportion in the cross-product format. The student was able to find the solution. ,39,mtms2012-04-464a,,
"As the vignette shows, the student did not solve the problem. Instead, he solved a proportion using cross multiplication because the equation was set up for him. The “helpful” teacher reduced the student’s cognitive load by directing him to the teacher-favored algorithm and by practically taking the student’s pencil and writing the relationships for him.

"In general, we can simplify a problem statement, not its solution process. For example, a task without numbers can create opportunities for students to think through the problem and use their cognitive power. A good source for such problems is a book from 1909, Gillan’s Problems without Figures for Fourth Grade to Eighth Grade and for Mental Review in High Schools and Normal Schools, available at http://www.schoolinfosystem.org/ pdf/2008/10/problemswithoutfigures .pdf. Here is a good case in point:  A cyclist competed in a race. How long did it take him to finish?",41,mtms2012-04-464a,,
"Not a single number appears in the problem statement. In fact, not  a vague question,  as with an unmarked track, will cause a student or cyclist to blaze his or her own trail to get to the finish line.  enough information is included to solve this problem. How do students tackle it?",42,mtms2012-04-464a,,
"I presented this problem to seventh-  grade students and challenged them to derive a general statement on the relationships among the variables involved in the problem. The students were confused at the beginning but were able to ask good questions to unpack the puzzle. I gave the students a few minutes to discuss the problem in their groups. Figure 3 shows the questions raised by two groups of students. In addition to the two key pieces of information—speed and distance—students asked about other factors such as location and breaks. Such information added contextual meanings to the problem. This is a crucial point, as students’ understanding of the problem’s context will assist them in the solution process.",43,mtms2012-04-464a,,
"The vague problem statement  required students to think and to ask questions, rather than being given information. They felt the cognitive need to obtain information about distance and speed as well as other factors in the race. I told students about the Tour de France, the annual bicycle race that traverses cities, the countryside, coasts, and mountains in France. Professional cyclists compete in the three-week race that is 3479 kilometers, or about 2161 miles. The students learned about  the twenty-one stages (or day-long segments) in the 2011 tour, including information about the date, location, terrain, and distance of each stage. After learning about this race, the students constructed some facts for their Bike Race problem:  1.  The cyclist’s name was Baron. 2.  The distance of the race on a  particular day was 130 miles.",44,mtms2012-04-464a,,
"3.  Baron’s average speed was 30 miles per hour (mph), although his speed could vary on different terrains. ",45,mtms2012-04-464a,,
"Therefore, this task was not an ordinary problem for students. The vague problem statement required students to ask questions, rather than operate on given information. They recognized the need for information about distance, speed, and other factors of the race. After exploring both key and auxiliary information and giving the problem contextual meanings, the Bike Race problem became this:  Baron competed in a 130-mile race. His average speed was 30 mph. How long did it take him to finish?",46,mtms2012-04-464a,,
"Having explored the context, most students did not find it difficult to solve the problem. I encouraged them to solve it in as many ways as possible. (See fig. 4 for the three major methods.)",47,mtms2012-04-464a,,
"Most groups applied what they  learned about unit rates and set up a proportion. They also divided 130 by 30 to get an answer. One group drew a diagram to represent the problem situation. Another group drew a similar diagram but showed horizontal routes. The diagrams helped students see the relationship. These solution strategies might not seem surprising, but the students demonstrated a better understanding of their methods and what the resulting number (4.33) meant, compared with other students I had taught. The third method is related to scenario 2 and proportional thinking. Instead of taking students’ pens and doing mathematics for them, suggest that students draw a diagram to represent the problem situation and prompt them to observe the numbers and relationships.",48,mtms2012-04-464a,,
The most challenging aspect of the Bike Race problem was for students to extend their understanding from one particular case to a general statement on the relationships among the variables involved.

I asked the students to describe any pattern or relationship they could see in the data. They readily saw that as distance increased, so did the time needed to finish the daily stage. I encouraged them to provide a more thorough explanation of the relationship. Two groups of students presented ideas (see fig. 5). They understood that one could calculate the time by means of dividing distance by speed, which was 30 mph in this particular case.",55,mtms2012-04-464a,,
"I further challenged students to  consider all twenty-one stages in the entire race and think about all cyclists with various abilities and speeds as they answered, How long does it take a cyclist to finish a race? The students gradually understood that the three key variables were distance, speed, and time. A few groups derived a general statement on the relationships (see  fig. 6). Traditionally, students are given a formula and then apply it to solve various problems.",56,mtms2012-04-464a,,
"In these activities, the students investigated variables (both necessary and unnecessary) in a meaningful context and developed conjectures about relationships, although they did not use formal algebraic notation to represent the relationships or develop a mathematical proof. Finding the algebraic formula was not the primary purpose of the lesson.

We can provide hints for students to explore, for example, the sum and product of circumference and diameter as well as the difference between them, in addition to finding the quotient of circumference to diameter. With these four relationships, and perhaps others that they find, encourage students to investigate which relationships involve patterns that can be used to predict additional cases.",64,mtms2012-04-464a,,
"Figure 7 shows the work of fifth- grade students who had not been introduced to pi. For each circular object, the students first multiplied its diameter by 3 and compared the product with the circumference. (Earlier in the semester, they were told that the circumference of a circle is roughly three times the size of its diameter.) They found the difference between  three times the diameter and the circumference for each object and then calculated the average of the five differences (see fig. 7a). They did not see a viable pattern. With some assistance from the teacher, they tried addition, subtraction, multiplication, and divi- (a) (b) sion. After struggling, students found a pattern when they divided circumference by diameter and conjectured that the quotient of approximately 3.19 (the average of the five quotients) could be applied to other circles of various sizes (see fig. 7b).",65,mtms2012-04-464a,,
"Some students can use further help. They may need to see a table of circumferences and diameters. We can provide hints to guide students’ thinking but should not think for them. It is also important to engage students in a conversation about the nature of inquiry and problem solving. It is common for mathematicians, scientists, and engineers to try many different and ineffective strategies  before finding a solution. Students can develop a positive belief that not all problems can be solved in a short time. They will also realize that it is fine to be stuck and to learn from mistakes. This is the spirit of Standard 1 of the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics, which stipulates that students make sense of problems and persevere in solving them (CCSSI 2010, p. 6).",66,mtms2012-04-464a,,
"If a student uses a method that  appears wrong to the teacher, it is not a good idea for the teacher to call an end to the inquiry by telling him or her that the method is wrong (Van de Walle 2006) and that he or she should try quotients. Why? First of all, the  student might never understand why his or her own method is futile. Furthermore, the student will not learn how to identify patterns or evaluate the validity of proposed methods. Learning mathematics requires significant cognitive effort.

We have to believe that, if we let kids struggle, then they will learn.” He urges teachers to abandon the mindset that if they can explain mathematics lucidly and make it easy, students will understand. Instead, he reiterates the need for students to engage in challenging problems and for teachers to be less helpful and to shift the responsibility for learning to students, an idea he thought was the most basic principle of math education.",69,mtms2012-04-464a,,
