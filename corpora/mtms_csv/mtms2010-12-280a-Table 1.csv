"dDividing by fractions is considered by  many to be one of the most complicated procedures in elementary mathematics. The computations are not only complicated but also challenging to explain in the context of a word problem. From surveys, Ma (1999) found that many teachers in the United States had diffi culties with both the numerical computation and building appropriate word problems. Furthermore: ",3,mtms2010-12-280a,,

"Although calculating a correct solution was an important part of solving the task, the primary aim was to assess the participants’ conceptual understanding of fraction division. All successfully completed the task of creating and solving practical division situations, but their solutions miscommunicated the subtle yet important role of the divisor in the concept of division by fractions. It is precisely this role of the divisor that is lost when using the formulaic rule of invert and multiply. ",5,mtms2010-12-280a,,

"The understanding of most of the U.S. teachers was supported by only one idea—the partitive model of whole number division. Because other necessary concepts for understanding and their connections with the topic were missing, these teachers were not able to generate a conceptual representation of the meaning of division by fractions.

"Modesto has many new families who have moved here from within the United States and from other countries. Farmer John decided to sell some of his farmland so that houses could be built for these new families. He sold 1 3/4 acres to Happy Home Builders. The company plans on dividing the property into 1/3 acre lots and building a home on each lot. When Happy Home Builders completes this project, how many homes will they have to sell?

(c) Jan’s question and solution analyzed (see fig. 1). These samples were chosen because they represent the errors I continually encounter in my prebaccalaureate preservice teachers’ math class. Furthermore, I offer insights based on the measurement model of division approached by repeated subtraction to clarify the misconceptions common to the participants. Failure to address these misconceptions inhibits understanding of the meaningful computations underlying division by fractions.",16,mtms2010-12-280a,,

"In stark contrast to Ma’s survey results (1999), all the students represented here (and all the institute participants) used the measurement model of division. In other words, they took one quantity and divided it into groups of a specified size. Additionally, all participants posed a question that actually required the solver to compute an appropriate division problem for 1 3/4 ÷ 1/3. The common error occurred in interpreting participants’ solutions. Each error will be reviewed.",18,mtms2010-12-280a,,
"Joe tried to explain what the 1/4 part of 5 1/4 means (see fig. 1a). His misconception of the role of the divisor was fairly profound. The relationship 1/4 < 1/3 was a distraction and had no bearing on the answer. In his work, Joe failed to recognize that the 1/3-acre lot was the unit (the whole). He did not recognize that he had 5 lots each that were 1/3 acre and that his remainder was actually 1/4 of a 1/3-acre lot, which is 1/12 acre, not 1/4 acre, as he thought.",19,mtms2010-12-280a,,

",21,mtms2010-12-280a,,
"Although it is not usually men- tioned, repeated subtraction is closely connected with the division algorithm. When	dividing	one	integer	by	another,	 the division algorithm includes the notion of a remainder: If an integer a is divided by a positive integer b, then there are unique integers q (the quotient) and r (the remainder) such that  a = qb + r, with 0 ≤ r < b. The remainder is thought of as being the leftover piece of the dividend a after subtracting b a total of q times. For example, solving 20 ÷ 5 with repeated subtraction consists of removing 4 sets of 5 from 20 with nothing remaining (see fi g. 2). Thus,	20	=	4	•	5	+	0;	here,	q = 4 and r = 0.",22,mtms2010-12-280a,,
"Consider 13 ÷ 3. Following the  repeated-subtraction model shown in fi gure 3a, we remove 4 sets of 3 blocks (or one 3-block unit) and have 1 block leftover:	13	=	4	•	3	+	1.	What	is	this	 1	remaining	block?	The	1	remaining	 block from repeated subtraction translates to 1/3 of the 3-block unit that we repeatedly subtracted from 13 (see fi g. 3b). Thus, 13 ÷ 3 is 4 whole 3-block units plus 1/3 of a 3-block unit, which we write as 4 1/3.",23,mtms2010-12-280a,,
"How can we use this illustration to  build a deeper understanding of division	by	fractions?	We	must	visualize	 the fraction representation of 13 ÷ 3, written 13/3.

This answer was comparable to Joe’s misconception of the remaining 1/4.",24,mtms2010-12-280a,,
"Jan’s solution statement, “Therefore  the answer is 5 students,” was correct (see fi g. 1c). However, there was one technical lapse in not completely explaining the apparent confusion of 1/4 piece of ribbon with 1/4 student. By failing to include labels in the computations, the teacher lost track of the context of her answer. A “dimensional analysis,” that is, labeling each number throughout the solution, would have highlighted Jan’s confusion.",25,mtms2010-12-280a,,
"The fi rst two created problems contained the correct answer; however, a complete understanding of the division process was lacking. Hiding this misunderstanding becomes diffi cult when students are asked to give an interpretation of the answers. Two of these three examples of a division problem involving fractions contained misinterpretations of the relationship between the answer and divisor, in particular, the relationship between a fractional number in the answer and the divisor.

"The measurement model can be  used to reveal the relationship between the answer and the divisor. This model can also build connections with other concepts and models, such as the division algorithm, remainders, and the missing-factor approach.

Fig. 3 These diagrams of 13 ÷ 3 illustrate that the remainder should be considered in terms of the divisor.,30,mtms2010-12-280a,,
"Fig. 4 For 2 ÷ 6, there are no 6-units to subtract. The diagram shows that the original 2 blocks constitute the remainder, which was actually 1/3 of the 6-block.",31,mtms2010-12-280a,,
"(a) After subtracting four 3-units, the remainder is 1 block.",32,mtms2010-12-280a,,
(b) The remaining 1 block is actually 1/3 of a 3-unit.,33,mtms2010-12-280a,,

"What	about	2	÷	6?	The	repeatedsubtraction model does not do much since	6	is	bigger	than	2,	so	there	are	 no	6-block	units	that	can	be	removed	 in the repeated-subtraction process. In this	example,	we	remove	zero	6-block	 units, and the original 2 blocks constitute a remainder equal to 1/3 of the 6-block	unit	divisor	(see	fi g. 4).",35,mtms2010-12-280a,,
"Then, rewriting the fraction-strip process with the division algorithm, we	have	2	=	0	•	6	+	2.	Repeating	the	 computational process described above, we see the following:  +6 2 2 0= +•= 2 0 6 2 2 0 6 2 0 6 2 0 6•0 6 0 6 0 6•0 6 = +0= +0",36,mtms2010-12-280a,,
"Here again, the connection among the remainder from division, the divisor, and the fractional form of the answer is	evident.	With	the	measurement	 model of division, the divisor is the unit to which the remainder must be compared. That is, what fractional amount of the divisor is the remainder,	or	remaining	amount?",37,mtms2010-12-280a,,
"In all three examples above,  the unit by which we are dividing changes from question to question. We	had	a	5-block	unit,	a	3-block	 unit,	and	ﬁ	nally,	a	6-block	unit.	As	 we extend to dividing by fractions, the size of the unit block (the divisor) continues	to	change.	We	build	slowly	 by dividing a fraction by a whole number or a whole number by a fraction. Each time, the idea is to use repeated subtraction and end up with an equation resembling the division algorithm. Instead of a q quotient and an r remainder, the idea is to have q represent the number of complete sets that have been repeatedly subtracted  from the dividend and r represent the amount of the dividend leftover after the repeated subtractions. For the sake of brevity, we shall save the case where the divisor is larger than the dividend until the last example, which involves a fraction divided by a fraction. ",38,mtms2010-12-280a,,
"Case 1: A fraction divided by a whole number or a whole number divided by a fraction. Let us demonstrate the fi rst situation of a fraction divided by a whole number. (The latter, a whole number divided by a fraction, can be visualized in a similar manner.) Figure 5 illustrates 12/5 ÷ 2 with repeated subtraction. We	have	12/5	–	(1	•	2)	=	2/5.	That	 is, we subtract 2 once from 12/5 and have a remainder of 2/5. The 2/5 leftover from the repeated subtraction is actually 1/5 of the 2-unit (or 10/5-unit) block being repeatedly subtracted. Thus:  12 ÷ =2 1 ÷ =2 1 2 1",39,mtms2010-12-280a,,
"Again, rewrite the equation in the form a = qb + r, with 0 ≤ r < b, so that the term with our divisor, 2, is on the right-hand side, and divide each side by this original divisor. Then simplify the right-hand side only. Notice that in the simplifi cation, the numerator and denominator of the rightmost term are multiplied by 1/2 to clear the complex fraction: ",40,mtms2010-12-280a,,

"Case 2: A fraction divided by a smaller fraction. We	increase	the	conceptual	 diffi culty of the task by dividing one fraction by a smaller fraction by returning to the motivating computation for this article, 1 3/4 ÷ 1/3.

This arithmetic process allows us to model the solutions to two questions that get to the heart of Joe and Pam’s misconceptions:  •	 A	road	1	3/4	miles	long	is	divided	 into	1/3-mile	sections.	What	is	the	 length of the leftover section of road?	 •	 A	road	1	3/4	miles	long	is	divided	 into 1/3-mile sections. How many sections	can	be	made?,47,mtms2010-12-280a,,
"The answer to the fi rst question is 1/12 mile. This may be found by repeated subtraction or by fraction division and running the process above backward (i.e., recognizing that the 1/4 is in fact 1/4 of 1/3 mile, or 1/4 • 1/3 = 1/12 mile). The answer to the second question is 5 1/4 sections, the 1/4 being 1/4 of 1/3 mile. It may be solved by fractional division or by the process described above. All solutions require understanding the role of a divisor. The divisor represents the set being repeatedly subtracted.",48,mtms2010-12-280a,,
"Case 3: A smaller fraction divided by a larger fraction. Finally, we extend this problem to dividing a smaller fraction by a larger fraction. Here, concrete word problems with the partitive model are diffi cult to properly create. Gregg and Gregg (2007) suggest using servings of cookies as a context, but they build this concept by beginning with larger numbers divided by	smaller	numbers.	With	serving	 sizes, one must be comfortable with the idea of fractional servings.

Through	manipulation of the repeated-subtraction model by factoring out the divisor, we built the missing-factor model of division. Once again, these two processes  may seem a long way around the invert-and-multiply rule, but their purpose is to underscore the connection between the fractional amount of an answer and the divisor. This relationship is at the heart of misconceptions and can make fractional division diffi cult, especially when solving word problems. Furthermore, we built on our summer institute participants’ foundation of the measurement model, using the repeated-subtraction approach to visualize the misconception and basic equation manipulation to correct the connections. Finally, we took it one step further to build the missing-factor model of division, a  gateway to building a wider variety of appropriate word problems.
