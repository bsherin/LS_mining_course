8,Solve It! Student Thinking: Aunt Marthas Cupcakes,"tThe submissions showed that a  majority of students used a form of guess and check to solve the problem, whereas older students tended to use algebraic methods. With guessand-check strategies, representations varied significantly. Students drew pictures, used numbers within boxes, and made organized lists. This variety demonstrated some common and interesting techniques. ",8,Solve It! Student Thinking: Aunt Marthas Cupcakes
9,Solve It! Student Thinking: Aunt Marthas Cupcakes,"Many students’ first attempts  seemed to be focused on the notion of “fair shares,” even though nothing in the problem suggested that the cupcakes were to be divided equally. Jessica Walker noted that some of her students simply wanted to divide the cupcakes equally among the five trays, but found that the result did not meet the criteria for the pairs of trays. Many of the students in each teacher’s class started by putting 26 cupcakes on each tray to meet the first criteria. Ben, a third-grade student in Deborah Wagner’s class, began in this way (see fig. 1), then he used that number to calculate how many cupcakes would be on the third, fourth, and fifth trays using the clues about the pairs of trays. Although this method gave him numbers that worked for each pair, it only totaled 99 cupcakes, not the 100 that the problem required. ",9,Solve It! Student Thinking: Aunt Marthas Cupcakes
10,Solve It! Student Thinking: Aunt Marthas Cupcakes,"Fig. 1 Ben’s actions mirrored those of many students. He started to solve the problem by splitting the cupcakes evenly over the first two trays and found a total of 99, rather than 100, cupcakes. ",10,Solve It! Student Thinking: Aunt Marthas Cupcakes
11,Solve It! Student Thinking: Aunt Marthas Cupcakes,Fig. 2 Armoni found that his first attempt resulted in 99 cupcakes. He described how he adjusted his trays to find the correct solution.,11,Solve It! Student Thinking: Aunt Marthas Cupcakes
12,Solve It! Student Thinking: Aunt Marthas Cupcakes,"First, I divided 2 into 52 to get 26. . . . After I subtracted 26 from 52 to get 26. Then I subtracted 26 from 43 and got 17. After I subtracted 17 from 34 to get 17. Then I subtracted 17 from 30 to get 13. After I added 26, 26, 17, 17, and 13 together to get 99 and saw that I had been 1 away from getting 100. After seeing this I tried the same thing over, but instead of the first number being 26 I turned it into 27. Then I subtracted 27 from 52 to get 25. After I subtracted 25 from 43 to get 18. Then I subtracted 18 from 34 to get 16. After I subtracted 16 from 30 to get 14. Then I added 27, 25, 18, 16, 14 together to get 100.",12,Solve It! Student Thinking: Aunt Marthas Cupcakes
13,Solve It! Student Thinking: Aunt Marthas Cupcakes,"Several students at various grade levels tried to use this same strategy. Armoni, a student in Cris Wellington’s class, also began as Ben had, then reasoned through a strategy to adjust the numbers to make them work (see fig. 2). Armoni’s actions increased three trays by 1 cupcake each and decreased two trays by 1 cupcake, which resulted in the 1 extra cupcake that he was short in his first attempt. Similarly, Josh, a student in Kirstin Subach’s class, began by sharing two trays equally and then making adjustments. However, he started with the fourth tray and fifth tray each having 15 cupcakes, totaling 101 cupcakes. ",13,Solve It! Student Thinking: Aunt Marthas Cupcakes
14,Solve It! Student Thinking: Aunt Marthas Cupcakes,"Josh decided that if he subtracted 1 from the first tray and added 1 to the second, and kept alternating through the five trays, he would keep each pair the same but lower the total by 1. ",14,Solve It! Student Thinking: Aunt Marthas Cupcakes
15,Solve It! Student Thinking: Aunt Marthas Cupcakes,"Other students used more random guess-and-check methods, but often would not keep a complete record of their attempts, simply erasing numbers that did not work and trying new numbers. However, some students, like Sarah from Wagner’s sixth-grade class, were more systematic and kept careful records of all the numbers that had been tried (see fig. 3). Sarah began by assigning some constraints to the number of cupcakes that could be  on each tray, which she thought were reasonable. For example, she noted that no tray should contain more than 30 cupcakes. Her work shows all numbers less than 30 as being possible values for the first tray, but she reduced that listing to only numbers between 23 and 29 before actually calculating all the pairings. She then systematically listed some possible number pairs that would give the  appropriate number of cupcakes on pairs of trays and checked the total number of cupcakes that would result. Some of the older or more advanced students used algebraic strategies. Most of these solutions involved assigning ",15,Solve It! Student Thinking: Aunt Marthas Cupcakes

17,Solve It! Student Thinking: Aunt Marthas Cupcakes,Fig. 4 Joshua’s algebraic approach used five equations and five unknowns.,17,Solve It! Student Thinking: Aunt Marthas Cupcakes
18,Solve It! Student Thinking: Aunt Marthas Cupcakes,Fig. 5 Jack and David’s algebraic work involved a single variable.,18,Solve It! Student Thinking: Aunt Marthas Cupcakes
19,Solve It! Student Thinking: Aunt Marthas Cupcakes,"variables to represent the number of cupcakes on each tray, writing equations to represent each clue, and then using multiple substitutions to solve for each variable. In each of these  cases, the students substituted a quantity for two pairs of variables in the equation in which all the trays totaled 100. Joshua, a student in Jeff Chaffee’s class, used this technique in his solution (see fig. 4). He solved for the number of cupcakes on tray 5, then moved to tray 4, and so on. Finally, he checked his solution for the overall total. Other students who worked with five variables used similar reasoning but may have started by solving for the first tray or even the third tray first. ",19,Solve It! Student Thinking: Aunt Marthas Cupcakes
20,Solve It! Student Thinking: Aunt Marthas Cupcakes,"Finally, Jack and David, students in Donna Burge’s class, chose to use only one variable, x, in their algebraic solution. They represented the number of cupcakes on each tray in terms of the single variable (see fig. 5). These  students then added all the expressions to get an equation that contained a single variable, simplifying to  x + 73 = 100. ",20,Solve It! Student Thinking: Aunt Marthas Cupcakes
21,Solve It! Student Thinking: Aunt Marthas Cupcakes,They then used their value of x to  determine the number of cupcakes on each tray according to the initial expressions. ,21,Solve It! Student Thinking: Aunt Marthas Cupcakes
22,Solve It! Student Thinking: Aunt Marthas Cupcakes,"As usual, when we ask students to solve problems and then listen to their methods, we often wonder if there was another question we could have asked that might have changed the results or the methods that students used. We would have liked to ask students who solved the task algebraically if they could solve the problem in another way. Would they recognize  that they could have solved for tray 1, tray 3, or tray 5 first with equal ease, using their algebraic approaches? For those who used the guess-and-check method and who started with equal sharing of two or more trays, it may have been interesting to give them a problem with numbers and a solution in which the individual parts were not of a similar size. This would mean that their totals would not be as close to the desired total, and their “adjustments” may not have been as easily identified. Would this have caused them to adjust their original method of attack? ",22,Solve It! Student Thinking: Aunt Marthas Cupcakes
