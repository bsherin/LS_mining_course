Trends and relationships that are hidden in the numerical displays are often quite obvious if the appropriate graph is constructed.,6,mtms2007-03-380a,,
"I used the data set shown in table 1 with a  class  of  preservice elementary teachers, hoping to demonstrate the usefulness of graphical displays. We found  more than I expected and enjoyed a surprising history lesson at the same time. Table 1 contains u.S. census data dating to 1790, along with a column displaying the population density (i.e., people per square mile) of the country at each census year.",7,mtms2007-03-380a,,
"The textbook in which this table appeared (Bassarear 2005) explored the relationship between the increase in the number of people in the population and the percent increase in the population at ten-year intervals since 1790. Figures 1 and 2 show this relationship. Most students are surprised to learn that as the size of the population increases, the percent increase generally decreases because of  the larger base population. few students were able to predict the inverse nature of that relationship by inspecting the data set.",8,mtms2007-03-380a,,
