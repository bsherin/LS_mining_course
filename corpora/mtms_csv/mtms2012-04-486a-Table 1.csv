Mathematical discourse in Writing,4,mtms2012-04-486a,,
"How do your students perform when they are asked to explain how they solved a math problem? Can they identify and communicate their thinking and why they use certain problemsolving methods? What instructional practices support students as they continue to develop these skills? This article describes an action research project in which a sixth-grade teacher engaged students in writing about their problem-solving efforts. The written mathematical work provided new artifacts for examining students’ metacognitive and mathematical communication skills, prompting the teacher to make instructional changes to address students’ needs. ",5,mtms2012-04-486a,,
"As students transition from elementary school to middle school mathematics, topics become increasingly complex and abstract. This transition requires students not only to use their declarative and procedural knowledge but also to communicate how they applied conceptual knowledge in their problemsolving methods. Explaining and justifying their mathematical thinking and reasoning create opportunities for  students to consider mathematical concepts and procedures and the connections among them (Cobb et al. 1997). To organize their thinking and communicate the language of mathematics (NCTM 2000), students must be aware of, evaluate, and regulate their own mathematical thinking—a process often referred to as metacognition (Wilson and Clarke 2004). Mathematical discourse—the  written and spoken mathematical communication that occurs in a classroom—supports students as they construct new mathematical understandings. Engaging in meaningful, structured mathematical discourse gives students opportunities to explain and evaluate their thinking. Written discourse has particular advantages because the act of writing is a refl ective process that can further enhance understanding (Steele 2007). Written discourse also creates a record of students’ work, allowing educators to assess strengths and weaknesses in students’ metacognitive and mathematical problem-solving skills (Kramarski, Mevarech, and Arami 2002) and then design instruction to target students’ needs.",6,mtms2012-04-486a,,
PRoBleM-solVing Pen Pals,7,mtms2012-04-486a,,
"We instituted a pen pal correspondence between a sixth-grade class and preservice teachers enrolled in a mathematics methods course. The sixth-grade students were given opportunities to develop and practice their mathematical communication through focused, individualized written correspondence with a knowledgeable peer. Before beginning the project, the students were comfortable verbally communicating their procedural knowledge as part of their regular classroom routine. The teacher thought that corresponding with preservice pen pals would give them rich opportunities to communicate their mathematical thinking as well as their reasoning. ",8,mtms2012-04-486a,,
Writing is a  reﬂ ective process that can further  enhance  understanding.,9,mtms2012-04-486a,,
The Pen Pal Cycle,10,mtms2012-04-486a,,
"The sixth graders worked in small groups to respond to a main question and additional, open-ended questions posed to promote discourse. The teacher introduced each problem and asked students to complete a graphic organizer with this information:  1.  The problem’s main question 2.  Potential solution methods 3.  The student’s work 4.  The student’s fi nal response ",11,mtms2012-04-486a,,
"The sixth graders then discussed the problem in groups. Finally, students wrote a letter to their pen pal describing their understanding of the problem, their problem-solving methods, their reasons for using those methods, and their answer. The teacher sent completed graphic organizers and letters to the preservice teacher pen pals. ",12,mtms2012-04-486a,,
"After the preservice teachers reviewed their pen pals’ graphic organizers and letters, they crafted responses that included feedback on students’ work and explanations and questions eliciting further explanation of the problem-solving efforts. Extension questions, meant to draw on higher-order thinking skills, were sent to students who understood the problem. The responses were sent to the sixth-grade teacher for her students. The fi nal step in this systematic correspondence was a response from the sixth grader addressing the questions from the preservice teacher’s letter. ",13,mtms2012-04-486a,,
Analyzing Pen Pal Discourse,14,mtms2012-04-486a,,
"After four iterations of this cycle, the sixth-grade teacher reviewed her students’ letters. Although the students were able to describe their solution procedures, many were unable to explain the thinking and reasoning behind those procedures. This prompted her to analyze her students’ work more closely, reading the correspondence between the students and their pen pals to determine what the students were communicating (procedures, thinking and reasoning, and so on) as well as the level of detail and clarity in their explanations. She observed that— 1.  if students thoroughly analyzed  and understood the context of the problem, they were better able to give descriptive, mathematically based explanations of their problem-solving processes.",15,mtms2012-04-486a,,

Discourse surrounding “Which ,17,mtms2012-04-486a,,
"Graph Is Which” (Sakshaug, Olson, and Olson 2002) illustrates these points. The problem presents two untitled bar graphs and two scenarios about a class of thirty students: the number of times students eat school lunch in a month and the number of pets that each student owns. Students must match each scenario to the appropriate graph. Figure 1 shows that differences in the degree to which the sixth-grade students thoroughly considered and understood the context of the problem infl uenced the level of detail used in describing their reasoning processes.",18,mtms2012-04-486a,,
"Student E understood the context  of the problem and described his mathematical reasoning and thinking. He reasoned that there are only about 20 days of school in a month, so the ",19,mtms2012-04-486a,,
Fig. 1 These excerpts demonstrated the thinking of two sixth-grade students on the “Which Graph Is Which” task.,20,mtms2012-04-486a,,
"student e “I got graph B for pets because graph A shows 25 at the highest point on the y-axis and there’s only about 20 days in school for a whole month. I got 20 from multiplying 5 × 4. Lunches for graph A makes sense to me because it only numbers up to 25, which is closer to 20 than 30. And graph B for lunches doesn’t make sense to me because there are up to 30 on the y-axis. Which is not as equal to 20 as graph A with 25.” student J “I saw how many pets said of 30 students. Graph B had a scale to 30 so I knew graph B would be how many pets. When I saw graph B was how many pets I knew graph A had to be how many times a child packs a lunch.” number of lunches packed should be close to 20. He selected graph A for lunches because the maximum value on the y-axis was 25. ",21,mtms2012-04-486a,,
"In contrast, student J’s explanation did not clearly detail her mathematical thinking and reasoning. The first line  seems to indicate that she interpreted the information about a class of thirty students to apply only to the scenario involving pets. Although she pointed out that graph B had a scale to 30, it is unclear whether she is referring to the x-axis or y-axis (both have scales to  30) or why this observation led to the conclusion that graph B was pets. ",22,mtms2012-04-486a,,
The sixth-grade teacher’s second  observation was that explicit questioning by the preservice teacher elicited more in-depth analysis of the problem and detailed reasoning from the sixthgrade student. The following excerpts from correspondence on the same graph problem provide an example.,23,mtms2012-04-486a,,
The method I used to get my answer was logical reasoning. Graph A would have to be number of pets each student owns because graph B’s y-axis goes to the number 30 and most months have 30 days in them. Another reason I chose what graph A and graph B were was that not very many people have more than 25 pets. ,24,mtms2012-04-486a,,

instRUctional changes,55,mtms2012-04-486a,,
"Written discourse from the pen pal project provided a new lens through which the sixth-grade teacher could view her students’ work and her own instruction. She found that her students needed more opportunities to communicate their mathematical thinking and reasoning. Considering a problem’s context and posing explicit questions about mathematical processes encouraged this development. These observations prompted  the teacher to make changes to her instruction to address these needs. As part of daily instruction, she  implemented the use of self-monitoring and teacher-initiated questioning. She modeled her practices on the THINK framework, developed by Thomas (2006), which encourages students to thoroughly analyze a problem, consider possible solution strategies, and monitor their problemsolving efforts (see fig. 2).",56,mtms2012-04-486a,,
"Before beginning this new ap- proach, the teacher facilitated a class discussion on “thinking about your thinking.” Students commented that they did not like writing about their thinking but enjoyed discussing it. Some felt it was hard to write about mathematics because they did not ask themselves self-monitoring types of questions. ",57,mtms2012-04-486a,,
"After the class discussion, the teacher used a problem from the MTMS Palette of Problems to model explicit self-monitoring questions and demonstrate productive group interactions. She also asked students to complete one problem-solving graphic organizer per group, instead of one per person, to ensure ongoing discussion of their problem-solving efforts. The teacher created small note cards outlining the main components of the THINK framework and additional self-monitoring questions (Van de Walle, Karp, and Bay-Williams 2010) for student reference (see fig. 2).",58,mtms2012-04-486a,,
"During week 1, students worked  on two problems from the Palette of Problems. Groups completed the problem-solving graphic organizer and then discussed their thinking, addressing the questions outlined on the note cards. During the second week, the teacher added written communication to the process. Again, using items from the Palette of Problems, students completed the problem-solving graphic organizer and discussed their methods and results. Then, individually, students recorded their discussions in a math journal.",59,mtms2012-04-486a,,
"Once a week, the teacher read  and briefly responded to the entries. The responses were intended to develop students’ metacognitive and mathematical communication skills. First, the teacher checked whether the student gave a clear, mathematically accurate description of his or her problem-solving process and reasoning. The teacher then responded with one or two explicit questions, eliciting further clarification or extension of the student’s response. During the following class, students addressed these questions as their journal entry for that day. Instruction continued in this manner for the remainder of the school year. ",60,mtms2012-04-486a,,
"Over time, the teacher noticed increasing numbers of students discussing problems longer during the initial stages of problem solving. These discussions typically included conversations surrounding the connections  between students’ different methods or insufficient reasoning provided by students that supported their method. The teacher also began to observe increasing numbers of journal entries that included explanations of students’ reasoning in addition to their procedural descriptions. The student’s explanations in figure 3 illustrate these changes. ",61,mtms2012-04-486a,,

Writing about problem solving gives students opportunities for refl ection and creates a record that captures and preserves students’ ideas. This allows the teacher time to analyze and refl ect on students’ communication. Teachers can facilitate written discourse either through math journals, in which a teacher responds to students’ mathematical discourse, or a problem-solving pen pal correspondence established between two different classes (i.e., middle school and preservice teachers or two different middle school classes) or within one class. Both formats can be used to promote an environment that encourages students to investigate, question, share, and analyze ideas while making connections.  conclUsion",71,mtms2012-04-486a,,
