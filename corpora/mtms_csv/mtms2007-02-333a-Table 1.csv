"IF  CITIZENS  ARE  TO  DEVELOP  AN  APPRE - ciation  of  mathematics  as  a  great  cultural achievement,  as  suggested  in  the  statement above from Principles and Standards for School Mathematics,  knowledge  of  the  historical  development  of  mathematics  is  necessary.  Middle  school mathematics and science classrooms provide a natural setting in which students can explore the rich history and fascinating stories associated with the development of mathematics. One effective and enjoyable way to incorporate such historical information into the classroom is by celebrating the life and ",6,mtms2007-02-333a,,
"VOL. 12, NO. 6  .  FEbRUAR y 2007   333 work of a mathematician each month of the school year.  Numerous  and  diverse  activities  can  be  designed for these monthly assignments. ",7,mtms2007-02-333a,,
"A celebration of mathematician of the month begins with identifying the individual who will be the focus of the month. The teacher can simply select the  mathematician  or  choose  two  or  three  candidates. In the latter case, students can then research the  candidates  and  vote  for  the  one  they  prefer. Throughout the month, students engage in various activities  focusing  on  the  selected  person.  The  remainder of this article describes a (baker’s) dozen activities that can be included in the mathematician of the month celebration.  1.  Read  stories  about  mathematicians.  One great source, which provides stories about the lives and  accomplishments  of  mathematicians,  is  Mathematicians  Are  People,  Too:  Stories  from  the  Lives of Great Mathematicians, Volumes 1 and 2 (Reimer and  Reimer  1990,  1995).  These  delightful  books, each  containing  fifteen  illustrated  vignettes,  introduce readers to famous mathematicians from various cultures. The books are written on a level that is  appropriate  for,  and  easily  accessible  to,  middle school  students.  They  can  be  read  individually  by students or read aloud by the teacher. Thirty mathematicians  are  highlighted  in  the  two  books;  the teacher may wish to select the two or three potential candidates for mathematician of the month from these books, read their stories to the class, and ask students to vote on the person to celebrate throughout the month.",8,mtms2007-02-333a,,
"2.  Write  biographies.  Many  excellent  books about  the  history  of  mathematics  are  available through  the  school  library  or  a  nearby  college  or university  library.  The  Internet  also  provides  a wealth of information. One comprehensive Internet site on mathematicians is the MacTutor History of Mathematics Archive, a site maintained by the University  of  St.  Andrews  (O’Connor  and  Robertson 2006).  This  site  contains  information  about  birth dates, birthplaces, mathematical accomplishments, and  pictures  of  over  1600  mathematicians.  Once students  have  conducted  their  research  about  the mathematician of the month, they may present their information  in  a  traditional  written  report  or  in  a PowerPoint presentation.",9,mtms2007-02-333a,,
"3. Prepare a children’s book. The information collected about the mathematician of the month may be  incorporated  into  a  book  appropriate  for  young children,  which  can  then  be  illustrated  and  shared with elementary students. The authors of the book might want to visit classrooms, read the book to chil- dren, and answer questions about the mathematician. If the book is to be prepared as a whole-class project, students should brainstorm about the important events in the life of the mathematician. Each event can then be assigned to a small group of students that will prepare a page of the book to depict their particular event. The pages can then be combined into an interesting book to be shared with young children.  4. Listen to a radio broadcast. The University of  Houston,  in  cooperation  with  public  radio,  has been  broadcasting  radio  clips  about  the  lives  and accomplishments  of  famous  scientists  since  1988. These three- to four-minute clips, titled The Engines of Our Ingenuity, are designed to “tell the story of how  our  culture  is  formed  by  human  creativity.” There is at least one radio broadcast for most of the mathematicians  included  in  Mathematicians  Are People,  Too,  as well as for many other famous scientists and mathematicians. These audio clips can be  retrieved  at  www.uh.edu/engines/engines.htm (Lienhard  2006).  Students  may  also  write  and  record radio clips similar to those available online, especially if there is no recording currently available for the mathematician being studied. ",10,mtms2007-02-333a,,
"Note:  The  series,  The  Engines  of  Our  Ingenuity, is available, at no charge, for broadcast on noncommercial  radio  stations  (Lienhard  2006).  Students may be interested in writing letters to local noncommercial radio stations requesting that the series be broadcast in their area. For information, see www.",11,mtms2007-02-333a,,
"uh.edu/engines/engines.htm.  5.  Write  and  produce  a  play.  A creative way to learn about the mathematician of the month and capitalize on imaginative interests of students is for a group of students to write and produce a play about the  mathematician  of  the  month.  One  such  play, Hypatia’s Street Theatre: Act I, containing information  about  the  first  female  mathematician,  is  available  at  www.math.ubc.ca/people/faculty/hoek/",12,mtms2007-02-333a,,

"6.  Correspond  with  a  contemporary.  While researching  the  mathematician  of  the  month,  students  can  find  information  about  other  important people who lived at the same time. The MacTutor Math History Archive contains timelines that document  other  mathematicians  who  lived  during  the same  era.  Information  about  other  historical  figures, such as political and religious leaders, can be found in history textbooks. Students can then write a letter from the mathematician of the month to the selected contemporary, explaining the work of the mathematician and inquiring about the work of the other person.  7. Keep a journal. Instead of writing a biographical  report  on  the  mathematician  of  the  month,  students may choose to write a journal for the person. The journal should contain descriptions of everyday events common in the life of the mathematician. To provide more variety, students may be given the option  of  writing  a  journal  for  a  contemporary  of  the selected mathematician. See figure  1 for a sample journal entry.  8. Present a monologue. Students can research the typical dress from the time period of the mathematician of the month, then dress in period clothing, visit classrooms, and present some of the mathematician’s  accomplishments.  For  example,  a  student who chose Euclid might dress in a toga and present geometric  drawings  and  simple  propositions  from the  Elements.  Complete  texts  and  geometric  illustrations of the thirteen books of Euclid’s Elements are  available  at  aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/ elements/elements.html (Joyce 2006).",14,mtms2007-02-333a,,
"9.  Display  information  on  a  map.  The birthplace, travels, and place of death of the chosen mathematician can be shown on a map. These locations should be displayed using a uniquely colored sticker or tack. by the end of the year, the location for each mathematician studied can be mapped. Students will not only be learning about mathematics and mathematicians, they will also be learning about geography  and  map  making.  Interactive  maps,  indicating mathematicians’  birthplaces,  are  also  available  on the MacTutor Math History Archive.  10. Create a bulletin board. Each month, information about the mathematician of the month can be displayed on a bulletin board. The display would most  likely  include  information  about  the  life  and accomplishments of the chosen individual. It could also highlight other information about the time period, such as common dress, transportation, religious practices, civic leaders, and so on.  11. Create mystery posters. Information gathered  about  the  mathematician  and  his  or  her  contemporaries can be shown on a poster, along with a  picture  or  sketch.  The  name  of  the  mathematician  should  not  be  indicated.  The  posters  can  be displayed,  and  other  students  can  be  encouraged to  find  the  identity  of  the  mystery  mathematician. These posters, accumulated each month, can be displayed at the end of the year. The task of identifying each mathematician of the month and his or her major accomplishments serves as a valuable assessment tool, indicating the amount of information that the students have retained.

"Dear Diary,",16,mtms2007-02-333a,,
"I’m in trouble again! My parents caught me trying to study math last night. I thought I was safe this time. Since they had forbidden me from studying math, I had hidden some candles in my room. After they were asleep, I got out of bed to do my calculations. My room was cold so I wrapped in a blanket and worked at my desk. The problem was that I fell asleep! My parents found me at my desk this morning with my ink well frozen and my books and papers still on my desk. They have again taken away my books. They tell me that studying math can be harmful to the development of a young girl. When will they ever allow me to study the calculations that I enjoy so much? Until tomorrow—Sophie",17,mtms2007-02-333a,,
"Fig. 1  Sample journal entry for Sophie Germain (Reimer and Reimer 1990) 12. Prepare a scavenger hunt. As students research  mathematicians  throughout  the  year,  they should  record  interesting  facts  that  they  discover. At the end of the year, these tidbits of information can be incorporated into a scavenger hunt. Each student can be given a copy of the scavenger hunt and a deadline for submission. Prizes may be awarded for the student with the most correct answers. (Perhaps a copy of Mathematicians Are People, Too would be an appropriate prize.) 13.  Create  an  artistic  display. As a culminating  activity,  each  person  featured  as  a  mathematician of the month is assigned to a group of students. The students agree on a significant event from the person’s  life  and  construct  this  event  through  an artistic endeavor, such as a diorama. These works of art, along with other artifacts created throughout the year, can be displayed for parents and other students. A scavenger hunt, such as the one described earlier, can accompany the display for viewers. ",18,mtms2007-02-333a,,

"VOL. 12, NO. 6  .  FEbRUAR y 2007   335 dents should be encouraged to record the sources of  their  information.  you  may  want  to  work  with the English teacher to determine the citation style used in English classes in your school. This same style should be used in the report prepared by students to encourage and promote proper research citation. Once the citations have been listed, each bit of information should be labeled with its source as 1, 2, or 3. Students will find a multitude of sites that  provide  historical  information  about  mathematicians. Some sites may contain contradicting information,  which  provides  a  good  opportunity for  you  to  discuss  that  some  historical  information is speculative and that some sources may be more  reliable  than  others.  In  general,  books,  encyclopedias, and articles in reputable journals are considered  to  be  more  reliable  than  information from  electronic  sources,  although  many  of  these are also quite reliable. Students will need practice and guidance in developing the skill of judging the quality and reliability of information. If contradicting  information  is  found,  students  should  be  encouraged to look for multiple sources that support the claims that are made. ",20,mtms2007-02-333a,,
