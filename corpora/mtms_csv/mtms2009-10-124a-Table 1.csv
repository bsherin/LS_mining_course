"While we were students at the University of Wisconsin−Eau Claire, enrolled in Abstract Algebra for Elementary School Teachers, we completed an activity similar to the one in “Take Time for Action: From Kinesthetic Movement to Algebraic Functions” by Mary G. Goral (in the March 2009 issue). The activity described a great way to incorporate kinesthetic and logical-mathematical intelligence, allowing for different types of learning. However, we noticed some discrepancies with the format of the activity description. Two concerns that we observed dealt with the definition of the star and the table, which are on page 389. ",8,mtms2009-10-124a,,
"As described in the article, students were to toss a beanbag and follow the path to create a five-point star, then repeat this kinesthetic activity to generate other stars. Because this activity is so complex, the answers to the following questions must be defined so that students understand:   1.  What is a star? 2.  Why could a five-point star not be ",9,mtms2009-10-124a,,

A star is a figure in which all given points incorporated as segments are drawn from vertex to vertex. ,17,mtms2009-10-124a,,
"For instance, we could form a fivepoint star by skipping 0, 1, 2, or 3 people (see fig. 1). Three different stars can be made by using seven points and skipping 0, 1, or 2 people. Furthermore, skipping 3, 4, or 5 people on a seven-point star would create the same stars as skipping 2, 1, or 0 people, respectively (see fig. 2). ",18,mtms2009-10-124a,,
"For this activity to result in a  function table, we suggest the definition of star be explained clearly to the students and that they record the smallest number of points skipped.   Students may question why the activity used only stars with an odd number of points. Is that to say that six-, eight-, or ten-point stars do not exist? (See fig. 3.) ",19,mtms2009-10-124a,,
"An alternative kinesthetic activity  is to ask students to find all possible ways to form stars made from five or more points. Then students can be asked to find the relationship between n (the number of vertices of the star) and k (the number of people away from the beanbag thrower, assuming clockwise throws). Note that our value of k is one more than  the number of people skipped, as described in the article. For example, a five-point star could have k values of 1, 2, 3, or 4 (see table 1). By doing this, however, no functional pattern exists. ",20,mtms2009-10-124a,,
"Nevertheless, students may notice a relationship between n and k when these values are relatively prime to one another. In the case of a tenpoint star, k may not be 2, 4, 5, 6, or 8, as these numbers all have a factor in common with ten. ",21,mtms2009-10-124a,,
"Another discovery that students could make involves noticing that when k equals 2 or 7 in a nine-point star, the same star is formed (2 + 7 gives us 9). Likewise, k values of 4  or 5 generate the same nine-point star. ",22,mtms2009-10-124a,,
"Although we liked the basis of the activity, providing a more formal star definition could lead to better com- prehension. We hope that by modifying this activity, students will gain a greater understanding of the patterns created by forming stars and develop different problem-solving strategies.",23,mtms2009-10-124a,,

Finding the lcM:  an alteRnate aPPRoach,41,mtms2009-10-124a,,
Most textbooks have two ways of  introducing the least common multiple. One way is to list the multiples of each number until a common  multiple is found. The other way involves factoring each number into primes. ,42,mtms2009-10-124a,,
"In my experience tutoring middle schoolers, I have found that some students have a hard time grasping either technique. I also noticed that students of this age group can confidently reduce fractions and check the equality of fractions by cross-multiplying. Therefore, I devised a method of teaching least common multiples that takes advantage of these skills. ",43,mtms2009-10-124a,,
"Suppose we want to find the least  common multiple of 16 and 20. First, write these numbers as the fraction 16/20. Then reduce the fraction to lowest terms, which is 4/5. Then we have the identity  we see that 80 is a multiple of both 16 and 20. Suppose there was a smaller common multiple, say,  16 × a = 20 × b, with smaller values, a < 5 and b < 4. Dividing both sides by 20a yields  which can be checked by cross-multiplication. In this case,  16 × 5 = 20 × 4 = 80.",44,mtms2009-10-124a,,
"The result of this check, namely, 80, is the least common multiple. I have found that students often catch on quickly when this method is taught. Furthermore, it is easy to see why it works. ",45,mtms2009-10-124a,,
"From the equality we constructed,  which would imply that 4/5 was not the most reduced equivalent. Therefore, 80 is not just a common multiple, it is the least common multiple. Thomas Freiling tfreiling989@yahoo.com",46,mtms2009-10-124a,,
