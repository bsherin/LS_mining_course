Creative “Solve It!”  Solutions: Animal Farm,2,mtms2009-10-127a,,

"Farmer Brown had three pens, each with the same number of animals. Pen A held cows, pen B held sheep, and pen C held pigs. One day, his careless nephew released all the animals from their pens. The farmer rushed to get the animals in any pen. Each pen now held a mixed group of cows, sheep, and pigs. He noticed the following when counting the animals: •  Each pen held the same number of animals as it did before  the animals were released.",4,mtms2009-10-127a,,
•  The number of pigs in pen A was the same as the number  of pigs in pen B.,5,mtms2009-10-127a,,
•  The number of sheep in pen A was the same as the number  of sheep in pen C.,6,mtms2009-10-127a,,
•  The number of sheep in pen A was 2/3 the number of pigs  in pen A.,7,mtms2009-10-127a,,

"This department shares creative solutions to the problems in “Solve It!” articles, which appear a few times a year in MTMS. Classroom teachers can send their students’ work, along with sufficient information to follow their students’ thinking. Send manuscripts to edward s. Mooney, Illinois State University, Campus Box 4520, Normal, IL 61790-4520, or by e-mail to mooney@ilstu.edu. Published solutions will be credited.  tThe student work included in this  article illustrates the various ways that students were able to think outside the box, or pen, as they solved this meaty problem.",9,mtms2009-10-127a,,
"Most students picked a specific number of animals for their calculations, then worked to meet the criteria of the problem. Jenna started by placing 3 pigs in pens A and B. She wanted to have 6 animals in each pen to reach her conclusion that the number of cows in pen C was four times the number in pen B (see fig. 1). Brittany and James, whose work is shown in figure 2, kept their animal numbers on the smaller side by working with 9 and 10, respectively. Benjamin, Ryo, and Jennie and Conor, who attend different schools and whose work is shown in figure 3, used numbers ranging from 27 to 60 as their animal number of choice.  fig. 4). Since each variety of animal was in a separate pen before the mix-up, and each pen contained the same number of animals before and after the mix-up, Sam realized that the number of cows, pigs, and sheep must also be 3x. He set up a table and used the information that was given to determine that the ratio of cows in pen B to cows in pen C was 1/4. ",10,mtms2009-10-127a,,
"It should be noted that it is not necessary, as seen from the examples in figures 2 and 3, for the number of animals  in each pen to be a multiple of 3. Sam could have let x represent the number of animals in each pen and would have come to the same conclusion. ",11,mtms2009-10-127a,,
"This task can give teachers the  opportunity to help students work on generalizations. Many students used one or two specific cases to solve the task. By having students share their solutions with other students in class, they could see that the total number of animals did not necessarily have to be a multiple of 3. However, the ",12,mtms2009-10-127a,,

"Sam was able to generalize the  process algebraically. In his solution, he used 3x, where x was a positive integer, to represent the number of animals in each pen. He used p to represent the number of pigs in pen A after the animals were returned (see ",14,mtms2009-10-127a,,

"Glenfield Middle School, Montclair, New Jersey (c) number of pigs in pen A did need to be a multiple of 3, since the number of sheep was 2/3 of that number. The use of literal symbols is also worth discussing. Many students, for example, used the letter C to represent cow, not the number of cows in a pen. ",23,mtms2009-10-127a,,
