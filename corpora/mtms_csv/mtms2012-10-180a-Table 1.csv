"Using literature in math class provides a venue through which students can think both critically and at length using contextualized problems taken or inferred from the text. By carefully examining what seventeenth-century philosopher Leibniz referred to as  “possible worlds,” or the many ways that life could potentially be, we may focus our sights on the joys and the problems inherent to humankind (Leibniz 1998). Middle school students, especially those who may view math class as an uneasy challenge, will benefit from experiencing mathematical inquiry in a less pressured fictional context through cross-curricular lessons. Within The Lorax, by Dr. Seuss,  lie many elements that middle school students can explore mathematically. Studying the environment, analyzing the needs of nature balanced against the realities of jobs and industry,  re-establishing deforested lands, and asking why specific choices are made are just a few of the topics that The Lorax explores. Although the reading level of the book falls at about third grade, its sophisticated philosophical and environmental science messages lend themselves well to discussions that can be pursued by older students. The content is multilayered and provides a compelling foundation ",3,mtms2012-10-180a,,

These attributes also make it possible to have a sound platform on which to construct an accessible-to-all Universal Design for Learning (UDL) lesson (Hitchcock et al. 2002). ",4,mtms2012-10-180a,,
"For teachers who have reservations about using The Lorax with older middle school students, the book could simply be introduced as a family literacy project. In this model, students are advised that the book will be read in class so that they may share the reading and the mathematics they will learn with a younger child in another grade, with a younger sibling, or with other family members (Beveridge 2005). The advantages to this approach are many: The teacher may prompt students during the lesson to describe how they might present the work to younger siblings, relatives, neighbors, or other lower-grade students, thus placing these middle schoolers in the age-appropriate roles of both learner and instructor. The classroom lesson then becomes a rehearsal for the retelling and reconfiguring of information learned in class that the student imagines might be re-presented later. ",5,mtms2012-10-180a,,
THE LORAX sUMMaRY,6,mtms2012-10-180a,,
"Although some Dr. Seuss books are lighthearted, The Lorax (Geisel 1971)  has a deeper story line. The book begins with a young boy approaching the old Once-ler, now living in a dilapidated, barren, and treeless land. The boy asks the Once-ler who the Lorax was and why he is gone. The Once-ler responds with a utopian tale about a forest, fi lled with silken Truffula Trees and bustling with animals that lived among the trees. He describes his realization that the Truffula Trees could be used to make a Thneed, a versatile and adaptable piece of clothing.",7,mtms2012-10-180a,,
"The Lorax, whose home was  among the trees and who speaks for them since they cannot speak for themselves, pleads with the moneydriven Once-ler, asking that the Truffula Trees not be cut down to make Thneeds. Dismissing the Lorax, the Once-ler instead increases tree harvesting and factory production of Thneeds. With the forest destroyed, its animals in fl ight, and the Lorax departed, the once-beautiful forest is reduced to a wasteland, with only the Once-ler in residence. The Once-ler says to the little boy, “Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better. It’s not.” (Geisel 1971, p. 58). The book concludes with the Once-ler giving the little boy the last remaining Truffula Tree seed.",8,mtms2012-10-180a,,

"The focus of these lessons supports the following NCTM Standards, which advocate that instructional programs should enable all students to— •  “solve problems that arise in mathematics and in other  contexts” (NCTM 2000, p. 256); and  •  “recognize and apply mathematics in contexts outside of  mathematics” (NCTM 2000, p. 274).",12,mtms2012-10-180a,,

"Activity sheet 2 focuses on calculating the deforestation described in The Lorax. Students must first use algebra to count the Truffula Trees provided in the aerial picture. Students are then asked to find how long it will take to chop down the trees on the basis of various scenarios. Finally, unit ratios are created and then used to find other ratios.

"The Lorax ends with a challenge to the boy to revive the Truffula Tree forest. To do so, the boy would have to plant trees. Activity sheet 3 provides a context connecting the revival of the Truffula Trees to algebraic equations. Students must describe a pattern, complete a table of values, and create an equation for both an arithmetic and geometric sequence based on the scenario given.

"A central feature of cross-curriculum instruction is that the teacher be able to spool different strands of the curriculum into a cogent whole. The focus of the lessons presented here is middle school mathematics. However, the authentic center of the lessons is the allegorical and topical “green” nature of the story and its characters—the faceless Once-ler, who through greed and ignorance destroys the environment, and the gentle Lorax, who symbolizes the forests that cannot save	themselves.	Each	of	these	core	 elements of mathematics, literature, and science supports one another, creating a richness that would be unlikely without the intertwining of the topics. If mathematics is to make sense to students, it may best be accomplished by tying strands together rather than breaking them into separate threads of reasoning. At the end of the story, the Lorax leaves behind this message: “Unless.” For mathematics teachers, the message could be a cautionary tale as well as a hopeful sign. ",27,mtms2012-10-180a,,
