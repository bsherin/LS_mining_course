Recently, touchscreen tablets are among the devices growing in popularity. Many mathematics apps are available; however, they vary in their usefulness for different users. Monitoring students’ interactions with selected apps is important for teachers to do to ensure that learners are benefi ting from technology integration. The Modifi cation of Attributes, Affordances, Abilities, and Distance (MAAAD) for Learning Framework (see fi g. 1) emerged from evaluations of students’ interactions with educational technology (Tucker 2016).

Users’ attributes (e.g., prior knowledge, interest in an app’s content) combine to become abilities. Each tool affordance is paired with a corresponding user ability in an affordance-ability relationship (see fi g. 1). This relationship contributes to users’ associated learning outcomes. During interactions, tools and users modify their respective attributes, infl uencing affordance-ability relationships and distance (Tucker 2016). Distance is the degree of diffi culty that a user has in understanding how to interact with a tool and interpret its responses (Sedig and Liang 2006). Figure 2 provides the MAAAD for Learning Framework applied to touchscreen tablet mathematics apps. ",10,Get MAAAD at Those Apps!
11,Get MAAAD at Those Apps!,"In this context, apps and users have  relevant attributes that combine to  form many affordance-ability relationships as well as two types of distance.

",17,Get MAAAD at Those Apps!
18,Get MAAAD at Those Apps!,"Tool and user attributes combine  to form affordance-ability relationships and distance. An example of an affordance-ability relationship is a user’s access to focused constraint. Focused constraint brings users’ attention to specifi c aspects of mathematical representations or processes, which benefi ts learners by making mathematical relationships more explicit (Moyer-Packenham and Westenkow 2013). Some apps afford focused constraint by restricting mathematical input (e.g., forcing the user to individually complete each step to solve an equation). Later, the app may change the constraint to allow different access (e.g., combining steps needed to solve an equation). Some users may continue the original behavior; other users may access the affordance in a different way. In this context, attributes also contribute to two types of distance. Mathematical distance is the difference between the mathematics presented by the app in relation to the users’ knowledge of the mathematics (e.g., using the appropriate property to simplify a fraction). Technological distance is the difference between the physical actions expected of users and the physical actions that they perform during these interactions (e.g., pinch-",18,Get MAAAD at Those Apps!

22,Get MAAAD at Those Apps!,"Modifying user and app attributes  (e.g., users strengthening their understanding of the additive identity property) can bring them into alignment, minimize mathematical or technological distance, and decrease a task’s degree of diffi culty. Alternately, changing attributes or applying different attributes (e.g., app requiring multiplicative identity property instead of additive identity property) can bring user and app attributes out of alignment and increase distance (Tucker 2016). Changes in distance can infl uence affordance-ability relationships. For example, a child learning to apply a new property has decreased mathematical distance and may begin combining steps to solve an equation.",22,Get MAAAD at Those Apps!

27,Get MAAAD at Those Apps!,"MAAAD for Learning Framework to evaluate each app’s features and narrow the selection to those that will best support student learning. Initial points to consider are an app’s mathematical, technological, and structural attributes. For example, does the app present the desired content with mathematically sound representations? What gestures are required to complete tasks successfully? Does the app offer users feedback or scaffolding? Different apps will interest and be appropriate for different students; therefore, an examination of app attributes should be followed by a brief refl ection on individual students’ preparedness for independent interactions with specifi c apps.",27,Get MAAAD at Those Apps!
28,Get MAAAD at Those Apps!,"In the following sections, we model the use of the framework to formatively assess a student on the basis of interactions with an app and to evaluate the appropriateness of tasks presented by the app. We present a series of interactions with Dragon Box Algebra 12+, which requires users to apply the additive and multiplicative inverse  properties to simplify expressions or solve equations. The Dragon Box represents a variable term to be isolated or for which the user is solving. Green vortices represent “zero” and are cleared away when tapped by the user. “To make a 0 (zero),” different-colored tiles with the same picture must be dragged together (technological attribute), which represents application of the additive inverse property (mathematical attribute) (see fi g. 3). ",28,Get MAAAD at Those Apps!
29,Get MAAAD at Those Apps!,"Patrick quickly progresses through the fi rst 6 levels of chapter 1. On level 1–7, he taps the green vortex on the right side of the mat to isolate the dragon box. He is surprised when the  dragon does not eat two of the tiles on the left side of the mat (see fi g. 4). He shows his teacher the screen and says, “It usually eats them all, but it doesn’t like these two.” ",29,Get MAAAD at Those Apps!

31,Get MAAAD at Those Apps!,"At fi rst glance, there seemed to be a low degree of mathematical and technological distance present as Patrick completed the task.

The dragon refused to eat two of the remaining tiles on the left side of the mat (see fi g. 4), however, which served as feedback that Patrick’s solution was not fully accurate. He did not recognize the need to apply the additive inverse property on both sides of the mat (mathematical distance between app and user attributes), which led him to isolate the dragon box before eliminating all zero pairs. The degree of mathematical distance present meant that the way in which Patrick accessed focused constraint resulted in an ineffi cient solution.",34,Get MAAAD at Those Apps!
35,Get MAAAD at Those Apps!,"Patrick’s teacher can place this  interaction in the context of his prior understandings. From these observations, she might infer that Patrick has not recognized dragging opposite tiles together as an application of the additive inverse property (i.e., a high degree of mathematical distance). He might think the objective is to combine like terms. Perhaps he is not associating the operations performed on the tiles with any mathematical operations (a greater degree of mathematical distance). To further explore his reasoning, Patrick’s teacher can scaffold his mathematical attributes through verbal cues and questions, such as these:  •  If every symbol represents a  numerical value, what number is represented by the green vortices?  •  What did you notice about the  tiles you dragged together to make a zero?  •  Remember when we talked about  properties; which property does that action represent? ",35,Get MAAAD at Those Apps!
36,Get MAAAD at Those Apps!,"Alternatively, the teacher might  elect to allow Patrick space for  productive struggle (NCTM 2014), independently or with peers, facilitating discussion of the thinking and strategies afterward. Students do not always spontaneously reflect on their strategies or why the strategies were or were not successful while interacting with apps (Baccaglini-Frank and Maracci 2015); therefore, it is important for teachers to engage them in discussion about the interactions to provide an opportunity for reflection. Whenever the teacher facilitates the reflexive discussion, it is important that she uncover possible explanations for the distance present and the variations in key affordanceability relationships present during the interactions, as they contribute to the experience of learning mathematics.

37,Get MAAAD at Those Apps!,Evaluating Task Appropriateness,37,Get MAAAD at Those Apps!
38,Get MAAAD at Those Apps!,"In chapter 2 of Dragon Box, tasks require Patrick to apply the multiplicative inverse property (see fig. 5). Identical tiles in the numerator and denominator of a fraction can be simplified to 1 by dragging the tiles together. A white tile with a single dot, representing 1, will replace the tiles. The additive inverse property can then be applied by dragging a black single-dot tile (–1) and white single-dot tile together. Patrick’s teacher notices the following while circulating around the classroom: ",38,Get MAAAD at Those Apps!
39,Get MAAAD at Those Apps!,"Patrick seems to be stuck on level 2–12. He repeatedly tries to apply the additive inverse property to a task that requires the multiplicative inverse property. He restarts the level several times and eventually taps the light bulb that has appeared in the topright corner of the screen. This  action opens a solution video [see  fig. 6]. After watching the video, Patrick requires several more attempts to complete the level. He continues to level 2–13 and repeats a similar cycle. ",39,Get MAAAD at Those Apps!

42,Get MAAAD at Those Apps!,"The framework can structure the teacher’s evaluation of Patrick’s interactions with the app. The app offers a solution video (scaffolding: structural tool attribute) that can potentially support Patrick in his efforts to complete the task (i.e., modify his mathematical attributes enough to focus his attention on the appropriate properties and sufficiently decrease mathematical distance). Patrick restarts levels and repeats solution videos until he can progress to the next level rather than quitting in frustration. His persistence during this sequence provides evidence of personal user attributes related to “mak[ing] sense of problems and persever[ing] in solving them” (e.g., the first of the Common Core’s Standards for Mathematical Practice [SMP 1], CCSSI 2010, p. 6). However, the teacher might question whether Patrick made lasting modifications to his relevant mathematical attributes. Does he now understand when to apply the different properties (i.e., ideal access to the affordance of focused constraint on this task)? ",42,Get MAAAD at Those Apps!
43,Get MAAAD at Those Apps!,"An assessment of the situation  might lead the teacher to question if Patrick is ready for tasks presented beyond level 2-11. She could ask him to restart the chapter (i.e., modify app mathematical attributes) and think aloud as he works his way back through the levels. Coupled with reflexive discussion, this strategy could shed light on the developing affordance-ability relationship by revealing more of Patrick’s mathematical understanding. She might discover that his earlier success resulted from growing understanding of additive properties (decreased mathematical distance), whereas later struggles resulted from a lack of understanding ",43,Get MAAAD at Those Apps!

66,Get MAAAD at Those Apps!,DISCUSSION,66,Get MAAAD at Those Apps!
67,Get MAAAD at Those Apps!,"The MAAAD for Learning Framework can serve as a resource for teachers to enhance the use of educational technology tools to support student learning. The interactions highlighted above offer examples of how the framework can be applied to interactions with mathematics apps to evaluate the appropriateness of apps and the tasks presented to individual students and to formatively assess students’ conceptual understanding. Table 1 offers guiding questions that teachers can use when applying the framework to consider whether an app may be appropriate for students and while monitoring user-tool interactions to ensure that students benefit from the experience of technology integration. The questions are organized by attributes, but most implicitly involve the interaction between student and app, therefore also including distance and affordance-ability relationships. For example, teachers consider many interrelated elements to determine whether a student is “ready” for the  tasks presented by an app they may want to use. This may include the mathematics involved in the tasks (app mathematical attributes), the student’s mathematical understandings (user mathematical attributes), what mathematics the app permits within given tasks (affordance of focused constraint), what students might do if they become frustrated (user personal attributes), and the productive struggle that may occur as the student progresses through successive tasks (attribute modification). The teacher can continue reflecting on these questions while observing as a student interacts with the app. Doing so may provide insights into the student’s mathematical understandings and the suitability of the app for other students. Applications of the MAAAD for Learning Framework extend beyond mathematics touchscreen tablet apps to other technology tools and content areas. Teachers  are encouraged to get MAAAD when integrating educational technology! ",67,Get MAAAD at Those Apps!
