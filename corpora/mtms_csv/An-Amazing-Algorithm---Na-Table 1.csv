0,An Amazing Algorithm - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The rapid growth of digital technology, including the worldwide adoption of mobile and embedded computers,  places new demands on K–grade 12 educators and their students. We believe that young people should have an opportunity to learn the technical knowledge of computer science  (e.g., computer programming, mathematical logic, and discrete mathematics) to participate in the growing digital economy. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that by 2020,  62 percent of new jobs in the STEM occupations will require computer  science knowledge (Austin 2013).",,
1,An Amazing Algorithm - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Many accessible programming languages are available (e.g., Alice, Kojo, Processing, and Scratch) to engage young students in computer programming experiences. However, there is a growing consensus among computer scientists (Bell et al. 2009; Cuny 2011; Wing 2008) that learning to code should be combined with instruction in computational thinking. We define computational thinking as the logical basis of computer science, which includes abstract structures, algorithmic processes, Boolean logic, and discrete mathematics.",,
2,An Amazing Algorithm - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,This article explores several class- room activities that introduce middle school students to computational thinking using mazes and related mathematical puzzles that are reducible to graphical representations and are solved through algorithmic processes.,,
3,An Amazing Algorithm - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,MAZES AND GRAPHS,,
4,An Amazing Algorithm - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"A maze is a network of passages connected by junctions, with a prescribed entrance and goal. We present a version of Trémaux’s algorithm that enables students to solve mazes and related puzzles efficiently. We also show how to represent a maze by its abstract graph. When studied together, these activities illuminate how Trémaux’s algorithm can be generalized to solve various puzzles (e.g., peg solitaire, the Towers of Hanoi, and river-crossing puzzles). These activities demonstrate some of the mathematical practices advocated in the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSM) (CCSSI 2010, pp. 6–7):",,
5,An Amazing Algorithm - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,• Make sense of problems and  persevere in solving them.,,
6,An Amazing Algorithm - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,• Reason abstractly and quantitatively.,,
7,An Amazing Algorithm - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,• Model with mathematics.,,
8,An Amazing Algorithm - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,• Use appropriate tools strategically.,,
9,An Amazing Algorithm - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Models are abstract representations of a complex problem or phenomena. Even a simple model that involves making choices and diagrams of graphs of various kinds are powerful tools for mathematical understanding and problem solving (CCSSM 2010). Developing an understanding of and implementing algorithms within the context of mazes can help students examine how algorithms work and how they model real-world situations. Mazes can be solved by random exploration or with a systematic strategy. Integrating the study of mazes with graph theory elucidates the connections between these puzzles and core areas in mathematics and computer science.,,
10,An Amazing Algorithm - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"A graph is an abstract structure that consists of a set of vertices (or points  or nodes) and a set of edges (or arcs) that connect either pairs of vertices or a vertex to itself. Every maze can be represented by a graph. First, vertices are drawn in the maze (see fig. 1a) coinciding with its essential features: the entrance, the goal, each dead end, and each junction (see fig. 1b). Edges are then drawn to represent each passage by connecting pairs of vertices that correspond to adjacent features in the maze (see fig. 1c). Think of the graph as being the skeleton of the maze, with the edges simplified by removing bends and shortening their lengths (see  fig. 1d). There exists a one-to-one correspondence between the routes through the maze and the routes through the graph. Consequently, any algorithm that can be used to solve a maze can be used to find an existing path between the starting and ending points in its graph. Conversely, any puzzle that can be reduced to finding a path in a graph between two given vertices can also be solved as if it were a maze.",,
11,An Amazing Algorithm - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
12,An Amazing Algorithm - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,TRÉMAUX’S ALGORITHM,,
13,An Amazing Algorithm - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"There are several methods for solving mazes. The most common method is “wall following” (e.g., place your left hand on the left wall when you enter the maze and follow that wall without removing your hand). Unfortunately, the wall-following method does not always produce a solution to the maze (see fig. 2).",,
14,An Amazing Algorithm - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,The earliest known algorithm for solving a general maze was attributed by Lucas (1891) to Charles Pierre Trémaux. This algorithm requires that students place one of two different marks (X and N) at the ends of the passages that they visit as they traverse the maze according to the following definitions:,,
15,An Amazing Algorithm - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,• One is said to be marching forward if one is traversing a passage for the first time.,,
16,An Amazing Algorithm - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,• One is said to be marching  backward if one is traversing a passage for the second time (thus going in the opposite direction of the first traversal).,,
17,An Amazing Algorithm - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Initially all passages are unmarked. The five rules enumerated in figure 3 describe how students mark the end of each passage they visit as they explore the maze. An important outcome of these rules is that every visited junction will be marked so that it has exactly one passage with an X. Every remaining passage that has been traversed is labeled with an N.,,
18,An Amazing Algorithm - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
19,An Amazing Algorithm - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,LEARNING ACTIVITIES,,
20,An Amazing Algorithm - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"One of the easiest ways to practice  Trémaux’s algorithm is with mazes drawn on paper. Begin with easy mazes, like the ones shown in figure 4, before working with more complex mazes. Encourage students to construct the equivalent graph of the maze as shown in figure 1. Reducing the maze to a graph requires students to define the locations of the junctions, which can vary according to interpretation. For example, the initial vertex in figure 1d has five incident edges, but it could be split into two vertices, resulting in a different application of Trémaux’s algorithm. Also note that the algorithm can either be applied within the maze (see fig. 5), or on the equivalent graph (see also fig. 7, which appears later in the article).",,
21,An Amazing Algorithm - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
22,An Amazing Algorithm - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
23,An Amazing Algorithm - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We have had success in asking students to pretend to be a mouse that always selects the leftmost available passage from its current perspective. We call this a left-bearing strategy. (Similarly, one can define a right- bearing strategy.) In figure 5, each of these strategies is applied to the maze shown from figure 1.",,
24,An Amazing Algorithm - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,APPLYING TRÉMAUX’S ALGORITHM TO LIFE-SIZE MAZES,,
25,An Amazing Algorithm - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Physically acting out different aspects of a mathematical problem helps students learn and understand concepts (Lengel and Kuczala 2010; Rayneri, Gerber, and Wiley 2006). One kinesthetic activity for students is applying Trémaux’s algorithm within life-size mazes (see the photograph on p. 546). Using painter’s tape, delineate a unique maze on a gymnasium floor for every four to six students in the class (see fig. 4).",,
26,An Amazing Algorithm - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Create passages that are about two feet wide and identify the location of the goal within the maze with an index card labeled with a special symbol (e.g., a gold $ sign). For each maze, allocate a stack of identically prepared index cards with a large X on one side and a large N on the other. Ensure that there are enough cards so that a student can place a card at each passage end that coincides with a junction. Also, give each student a matching picture of the maze to record his or her method for solving the maze and make a graph from it. You can challenge students by creating a variety of mazes, each containing several junctions and dead-ends for them to solve using the algorithm.",,
27,An Amazing Algorithm - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In any given turn, one student plays the role of the maze walker, who holds the labeled cards, placing one (correct side up) at the end of each passage visited, in accordance with Trémaux’s algorithm, without using notes. Another student plays the role of the maze master who tells the maze walker which unlabeled passage to follow when the algorithm provides a choice in situations 1 and 4. Another student records the decisions for the current maze walker, and the remaining students act as referees. Students take turns in the roles of maze walker, maze master, recorder, and referee. Once each group has completed the task of solving the maze, the groups rotate to the next maze and change roles.",,
28,An Amazing Algorithm - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"After the algorithm has been introduced and practiced, students can apply their new knowledge at a nearby corn maze, with the challenge of finding a path from the entrance to the goal using Trémaux’s algorithm (Snapp 2006).",,
29,An Amazing Algorithm - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Corn mazes can be found in  nearly every state; the website  www.cornmazesamerica.com provides an interactive directory for finding nearby commercial mazes. In a real corn maze (see the photograph on  p. 547), scratching two symbols representing the Xs and Ns into the soil with sticks or rocks provide the markings. Divide the class into groups of 4 to 6 students, so that they can share the labor. One student might be in charge of drawing the group’s X symbol; another, its N symbol; a third might read the ground for old marks (is this a new or an old junction?); and a fourth might choose which direction to proceed, based on the unlabeled passages as the maze master did in the gymnasium exercise. Because large corn mazes cannot be solved by inspection, this exercise demonstrates the computational power of Trémaux’s algorithm.",,
30,An Amazing Algorithm - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,STATE-TRANSITION PUZZLES,,
31,An Amazing Algorithm - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Since Trémaux’s algorithm can be applied to discover a path between two arbitrary vertices in a connected graph, it can be used to solve many mathematics puzzles by finding paths in graphs. An example of this is the well-known river-crossing puzzle, invented by pedagogue Alcuin of York in the eighth century, for teaching mathematical problem solving in Charlemagne’s palace school in Aachen (Hadley and Singmaster 1992).",,
32,An Amazing Algorithm - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"A farmer (F) arrives at the bank of the river that he needs to cross along with a wolf (W), a goat (G), and a bag of cabbages (C). The boat, however, is small and will only allow the farmer to transport himself and one other animal, or item, at a time. However, if the farmer leaves the wolf alone with the goat, the goat will be eaten (a lethal state). Likewise, the cabbages cannot be left alone with the goat. How can the farmer, by means of multiple crossings, deliver himself and all his possessions to the other side?",,
33,An Amazing Algorithm - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"First, we need to construct a state-transition graph for the puzzle. In  figure 6, each vertex corresponds to one of the sixteen different ways that the farmer and his three possessions can be placed on the two sides of the river. The green vertex, labeled FWGC||, denotes the initial state; within that labeling, the double bar || denotes the river; and each letter refers to the item that begins with that initial. The goal state appears as a gold vertex, with the label ||FWGC, indicating that the farmer and his positions are on the opposite riverbank. “Lethal” states appear in red, and “safe” ones in blue. The graph can be generated by a systematic procedure. Beginning with the initial state, every possible initial transition is considered:",,
34,An Amazing Algorithm - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,1. The farmer crossing the river  alone in the boat yields  WGC||F.,,
35,An Amazing Algorithm - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,2. Crossing with the wolf yields GC||FW.,,
36,An Amazing Algorithm - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,3. Crossing with the goat yields WC||FG.,,
37,An Amazing Algorithm - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,4. Crossing with the cabbages yields WG||FC.,,

39,An Amazing Algorithm - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Continuing the process generates the rest of the graph. Note that every state is accessible, and that two direct solutions exist.",,
40,An Amazing Algorithm - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"This puzzle can be solved by inspection. However, we show how Trémaux’s algorithm can be used  to determine a solution path. In  figure 7, the algorithm is applied with a left-bearing mouse strategy, using the rules enumerated in figure 3. Each edge of the graph corresponds to a passage in an equivalent maze. The lethal states (shown in red) represent dead ends, and blue vertices that are connected by more than two edges represent junctions. During the course of the algorithm, all but six edges (or passages) are traversed. If the seven edges traversed in both directions are subsequently ignored, one obtains a direct solution to the puzzle: FWGC||, WC||FG, FWC||G, W||FGC, FWG||C, G||FWC, FG||WC, ||FWGC.",,
41,An Amazing Algorithm - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
42,An Amazing Algorithm - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,The same procedure can be applied to create state-transition graphs and solution paths for these puzzles:,,
43,An Amazing Algorithm - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"1. A kitchen pantry contains two empty bottles, having capacities  of 3 and 5 pints, and an 8 pint  (1 gallon) jug of maple syrup. A chef would like to fill the 5 pint bottle with exactly 4 pints of syrup, leaving exactly 4 pints in the jug. How can this be done using only the three containers such that each transfer of fluid from one vessel to another must either completely empty one vessel or completely fill the other?",,

45,An Amazing Algorithm - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,3. Simplified versions of peg  solitaire.,,
46,An Amazing Algorithm - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Likewise, these abstractions and algorithmic processes can illustrate how data are routed through a computer network using a graph where nodes represent host computers and routers, and edges represent the operational data links between them. These processes also illustrate how messages are disseminated through a social network, in which the nodes represent individuals and the edges represent a social connection between pairs of individuals.",,
47,An Amazing Algorithm - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In all these problems, a graph is the underlying abstract structure in the mathematics. Here, computational thinking is used to reduce any one of these problems to a graph, which then may admit a previously studied algorithmic process, like Trémaux’s algorithm. In this sense, algorithms and graphs play a similar role in the abstractions of mathematics: points, lines, and planes in geometry; numbers in arithmetic; and equivalence relations in algebra. Whether in computer science or mathematics, a person employs the abstract tools of either discipline to solve problems successfully.",,
48,An Amazing Algorithm - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,SUPPORTING  COMPUTATIONAL THINKING,,
49,An Amazing Algorithm - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"With computational thinking, students “use a set of concepts, such as abstraction, recursion, and iteration, to process and analyze data” (Barr and Stephenson 2011, p. 51). In learning Trémaux’s algorithm, students employ abstraction, as they reduce a maze or a related puzzle to a graph, and recursion, as the same decision represented by the rules of figure 3 is applied at every step. Using Trémaux’s algorithm with the gymnasium mazes and recording the graphs, along with the culmination of solving the corn maze, can help students learn a recursive algorithm—thereby allowing students to think more abstractly about the problems. Teachers who help students develop a way of thinking and reasoning skills, and who emphasize problem solving and problem-solving strategies, in their teaching of the content, can enhance student achievement (Hattie 2009).",,
