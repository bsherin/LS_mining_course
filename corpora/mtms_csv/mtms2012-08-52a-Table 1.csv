Moving beyond Factor Trees,1,mtms2012-08-52a,,
"Many teachers use factor trees to explore the concept of prime decomposition, or the breakdown of a number into its prime factors. This factor-tree method, however, is not an ideal way to teach prime decomposition because no tools are used and little emphasis is placed on conceptual understanding. To view decomposition more comprehensively, teachers must move beyond factor trees.",2,mtms2012-08-52a,,
"The literature describes using  prime factor tiles as a way to support the teaching of prime decomposition at the upper-elementary-school levels (Kurz and Garcia 2010). Prime factor tiles, with prime numbers written on a sticker affixed to each tile, are movable tools. This sort of manipulation is not possible when using factor trees. Figure 1 illustrates prime factor tiles printed on card stock and more durable prime factor tiles made with one-inch plastic tiles. (See the primefactor-tile template, found online at www.nctm.org/mtms.) Prime factor tiles are treated differently from factor trees. Students start with the tile factors and then build up to the product. These lessons focus on extending the concept of prime decomposition beyond factor trees while emphasizing the multiplicative structure of numbers. Students should develop a greater sense of prime decomposition after exploring with these tools. During this activity, students will— 1.  use tiles to decompose numbers and  then find all the factors of a given number using the decomposition; 2.  identify and then develop definitions of greatest common factor (GCF), least common multiple (LCM), factor, and multiple;",3,mtms2012-08-52a,,
"Studies have shown that preservice teachers have difficulty with prime decomposition. They are generally able to make factor trees but are unable to apply the trees to mathematical contexts (Zazkis and Campbell 1996; Zazkis and Liljedahl 2004). Although no studies specifically address children’s knowledge of prime decomposition, it would make sense that they, too, have similar issues with this topic, since these preservice teachers eventually instruct this age group. Beyond that, the Standards state that students should “use factors, multiples, prime factorization, and relatively prime numbers to solve problems” (NCTM 2000, p. 214). The following activities move beyond the factor-tree diagram to a more robust model that integrates the use of tools to support an understanding of prime decomposition, factors, and multiples.

"This activity expands on Kurz and Garcia’s (2010) lesson in that students use prime decomposition to determine factors. Part 1 of activity sheet 1 asks students to find factors using prime decomposition. Part 2 asks students to use a frame to build factors for each number in pairs. Students will need the following tiles: 24, 32, 52, 7, 11, 13, 17. Figure 2 shows how the tiles might be used with the frame to build the factors of the number 24 with all possibilities shown. Students can only build two factors at a time. For example, they might put tiles 3 and 2 on one side of the handout and tiles 2 and 2 on the other side and record the factors of 6 and 4. At that point, they will need to find other factors based on the prime decomposition.",10,mtms2012-08-52a,,

Students often have difficulty recognizing the difference between a factor and a multiple. This activity helps students develop a strategy for finding the GCF and LCM of numbers. They will also generate a definition of factor and multiple. These student-generated ,12,mtms2012-08-52a,,

definitions will then be applied in a subsequent lesson on divisibility in context. ,14,mtms2012-08-52a,,
"Activity sheet 2 starts with investigations using Venn diagrams to find the GCF and LCM for pairs of numbers. Tiles 25, 34, 53, 73, 11 will be needed for this activity. Students may want to use a Venn diagram on a separate piece of paper for tiles and write their findings on the activity sheet. Figure 3 shows the Venn diagram for 56 and 36. In addition, the Factor Tree applet from the National Library of Virtual Manipulatives  (http://nlvm.usu.edu/en/nav/frames_ asid_202_g_2_t_1.html) can support this investigation.

"To decompose all primes and composites up to and including 102, the following tiles are needed:  26, 36, 54, 73, 112, 132, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97 and 101",16,mtms2012-08-52a,,

"Divisibility rules are often not clearly implemented. Divisibly is checked through division rather than logic (Zazkis and Liljedahl 2004). For example, students might be asked if a number is divisible by 2 and by 7. If the response is yes, then ask if the same number is divisible by 14. Students may not be able to reason that if a number is divisible by 2 and 7, then it must be divisible by 14. Students might work out long division by 14 to check for divisibility by 14 instead of using logic. It is important for students to understand the multiplicative breakdown of numbers and how it can be used to check divisibility. ",18,mtms2012-08-52a,,
"Activity sheet 3 can help students rationalize divisibility without using division or a calculator. When implementing this activity, encourage students to use logic. Do not permit the use of calculators, and discourage division. Although students may want to double-check solutions using a calculator, encourage them to have confidence in their reasoning instead.",19,mtms2012-08-52a,,
aPPlication Questions,20,mtms2012-08-52a,,
The questions listed below are designed to take some time. We do ,21,mtms2012-08-52a,,
"Fig. 3 in (a), the Venn diagram representation does not reveal the GCF of 56 and 36. The arrangement in (b) shows a correct Venn diagram. Duplicate factors are in the overlapping part of the diagram and discarded.  (a) Separate factors of 56 and 36 (b) Common prime factors of 22 for 56 and 36 not recommend that students work through all the problems at once. Rather, the instructor should offer time to investigate each question on the basis of students’ needs. Provide an opportunity for students to conjecture. What is the plan? How will they use the tiles? Allow students to use calculators when answering these questions so that they can focus on the mathematics rather than the computation. The answers for the application questions are provided in brackets.",22,mtms2012-08-52a,,
"1.  Find the two smallest numbers greater than 800 that have these numbers as factors: 2, 3, 7, and 17. [1,428 and 2,142] 2.  “Find the least divisible number by  each natural number less than or equal to 12” (Billstein, Libeskind, and Lott 2010, p. 312). [27,270] 3.  When checking whether 97  was prime, Patrick analyzed all numbers up to 97 by dividing each one on his calculator. Sammy told Patrick that he did not have to check all numbers but could stop  at a certain point. Patrick could not remember Sammy’s specific point. At what number can Patrick stop checking for divisibility? Why? Does this method work for all numbers when checking for divisibility? Try smaller numbers, such as 16, 36 and 48. Do you see a pattern? [The square root; once the square root has been reached, numbers on the opposite side would have already been paired. For example, 36 has the following factors: 1 and 36, 2 and 18, 3 and 12, 4 and 9, 6. Once 6 is reached, the numbers beyond 6 would have already been paired with the smaller factor.] 4.  Find the smallest number divisible by both 56 and 105. [840] What is the relationship between the number you found and the numbers 56 and 105? [The LCM] 5.  Arthur and David were trying  to find factors of a large number. They thought that this number might be prime. It was also not divisible by 2. David began checking other numbers, such as 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. . . . Arthur told David that he was wasting his time checking other even numbers (such as 4, 6, and 8). David disagreed and said that all numbers had to be checked. Who is correct? Why? [Arthur. If a number is not divisible by 2, then it will not be divisible by any multiple of 2.] 6.  “Find the greatest four-digit number that has exactly three positive factors” (Billstein, Libeskind, and Lott 2010, p. 312). [972 = 9,409] 7.  The numbers 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49,  64, 81, 100, 121 . . . are examples of perfect squares. Juanita and Pepe are trying to find the prime factors of a perfect square. After obtaining a few of them, Pepe exclaims, “Each of the prime factors appears in groups of two.” What does he mean? [The prime numbers appear  in pairs.] Can there be only three 5s in the prime decomposition of the perfect square? [No] Why? [Each prime factor appears an even number of times.]  8.  If you know the prime factors of 10 and 15, do you know the prime factors of 150? What are they? [The prime factors of 10 and of 15 are  2 × 5 × 3 × 5.] This strategy can help you find the prime factors of large composite numbers. What would be the prime factors of 15,000? [2 × 5 × 3 × 5 × 2 × 5 × 2 × 5; the factors of 10 × 15 × 10 × 10] 9.  If 5 appears twice in the prime  decomposition of 100, then how many 5s appear in the prime decomposition of 10,000? [Four because 100 × 100 = 10,000] How many 5s appear in the prime decomposition of 100300? [600] Why? [There are two 5s in each 100. Three hundred 100s would contain 2 × 300 = 600 5s.] 10. 20 × 15 = 300 is divisible by 6. However, neither 20 nor 15 are divisible by 6. How is this possible? [2 × 3 = 6; 2 is a factor of 20 and 3 is a factor of 15.] If 300 is divisible by 3, is it always true that either  20 or 15 is divisible by 3? [Yes] Why is this different for 6? [Because 6 is a composite number and could be decomposed among the two composite factors, whereas 3 cannot be decomposed any further.] 11. What is the smallest number that has 12, 24, 48, and 96 as factors? [96]",23,mtms2012-08-52a,,

"position, they need opportunities to move beyond factor trees. These activities allow students to focus on a more robust level of investigation. Prime decomposition is a complex notion. It takes time to develop conceptual understanding, and factor trees should not be the sole method of instruction. This fundamental concept should not be lightly touched on. Teachers should offer rich, meaningful investigations focusing on conceptual development rather than computational development. The lessons provided here support that goal. ",27,mtms2012-08-52a,,
"Beyond the lessons provided in this article, others are available to support the concepts of factors, multiples, and prime decomposition. Kurz and Garcia (2010) discussed prime numbers, composite numbers, factors, and the classification of 1 as neither prime nor composite. Burkhart (2009) described a model similar to that presented here but used colored blocks to support investigations. He focused primarily on concrete representation using colored blocks, with an emphasis on patterns and structures of factors and multiples. ",28,mtms2012-08-52a,,
"Robbins and Adams (2007)  wrote an article that evaluated prime decomposition, with an emphasis on the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, the sieve of Eratosthenes, and Goldbach’s conjecture. Robbins and Adams also focused on framing these concepts using understandable explorations designed for middle school students. Yolles (2001) also used the sieve of Eratosthenes to teach primes and connect history. The activities analyzed patterns of prime numbers. Finally, Bell, Leisner, and Shelley (2011) produced activities to help students develop a concept of what GCF looks like in practice.",29,mtms2012-08-52a,,
It is hoped that these activities as  well as the additional information noted above will break down prime decomposition into useable parts.,30,mtms2012-08-52a,,
