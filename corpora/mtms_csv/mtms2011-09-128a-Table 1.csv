"Golf balls are generally sold three to a package (see the photograph at right). They are also packaged by the dozen and sold as a four pack. Various factors can affect packaging, such as shipping to retailers, display space available, and cost of materials. Manufacturers, concerned with the best design for a package, have become more creative with package designs.",4,mtms2011-09-128a,,
"QUESTIONS 1.  A golf ball has a diameter of about 1.68 inches (or 42.7 mm). Consider the solids (a prism, a cone, and so on). Which shape would be best to use when packaging a single golf ball? Defend your answer. Make a scale drawing of the package using mathematical drawing tools.",5,mtms2011-09-128a,,
"2.  The photograph shows a package  containing three golf balls. The girth of the package is the distance  around one set of faces. Which is a larger measure for the package, its girth or its height? How can you tell? Are there other ways to package a set of three golf balls? 3.  Use drawing tools or graph paper  to sketch at least two different ways that a box can be designed to contain four of the packages of three. In the sketch, show how these packages are arranged in the box. Draw nets for each new box design. Cut out the nets. Use scissors and tape to create the box.",6,mtms2011-09-128a,,
"4.  Determine the length, width,  and height of a package containing three golf balls. Calculate the total surface area for each new box, which holds a dozen golf balls.",7,mtms2011-09-128a,,
5.  Calculate the volume of each new  box that holds twelve golf balls. ,8,mtms2011-09-128a,,
