19,A Percentage Increase Is Needed on Homework! - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
20,A Percentage Increase Is Needed on Homework! - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"c. For a 600 percent increase: 100 percent of 5 minutes is 5 minutes. Therefore, a 600 percent increase represents an increase of 6  5, or 30 minutes. The amount of time spent on homework would be 5 + 30, or 35 minutes.",,
21,A Percentage Increase Is Needed on Homework! - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"For a 700 percent increase: The time spent on homework would increase by 7  5, or 35 minutes. The new amount of time spent on homework would be 5 + 35, or 40 minutes.",,

24,A Percentage Increase Is Needed on Homework! - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"For a 333 percent increase: 5 + 3.33  5, or 21.65 minutes",,
25,A Percentage Increase Is Needed on Homework! - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"2. The correct answer is C, about 233 percent. Sample solution: The amount of increase is $20.00  $6.00, or $14.00.",,
26,A Percentage Increase Is Needed on Homework! - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
27,A Percentage Increase Is Needed on Homework! - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Students who incorrectly choose A may have divided 20 by 6, obtaining 3.33. . . and incorrectly interpreted that to mean about 3.33 percent. Students who incorrectly choose B may have divided 6 by 20, obtaining 0.30, or 30 percent. Clearly, a jump from $6.00 to $20.00 represents more than a 100 percent increase, so 30 percent is unreasonable. Students who incorrectly choose D may have divided by 20 by 6, obtaining 3.33. . . and incorrectly interpreted that to mean about a 333 percent increases. Whereas 20 is about 333 percent of 6, the increase from $6.00 to $20.00 is only 233 percent.",,
28,A Percentage Increase Is Needed on Homework! - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,3. a. About 4.9 percent. Sample solution:,,
29,A Percentage Increase Is Needed on Homework! - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,First test score (original amount) = 82,,
30,A Percentage Increase Is Needed on Homework! - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Second test score (new amount) = 78,,
31,A Percentage Increase Is Needed on Homework! - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Amount of change: 82  78 = 4,,

42,A Percentage Increase Is Needed on Homework! - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,The two percentages are not the same.,,
43,A Percentage Increase Is Needed on Homework! - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"5. $7.84. Sample solution: A 96 percent drop from $100.00 means that the stock loses 96 percent of $100.00, or $96.00. So after the drop, the stock is worth $100.00  $96.00, or $4.00. A 96 percent increase from $4.00 means that the stock gains 96 percent of $4.00, or $3.84. So after the gain, the stock is worth $4.00 + $3.84, or $7.84.",,
44,A Percentage Increase Is Needed on Homework! - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"6. 0. Let x be the original number. A 200 percent increase means that the number increases by 2x. So the new number is x + 2x = 3x. A 100 percent decrease means that the number is decreased by its entire value. The final result is 3x  3x, or 0.",,
45,A Percentage Increase Is Needed on Homework! - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"7.  $8,000.00 was raised two years ago. Sample solution: Let x be the amount raised last year. The amount of change from last year to this year was $10,120.00  x. Because the donations increased by 15 percent this year, we can solve for x as follows:",,

53,A Percentage Increase Is Needed on Homework! - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I tried the comic A Percentage Increase Is Needed on Homework! with my algebra students. They were allowed to pick groups of three to four students to work with, and most of the groups got into heated discussions about who was right and who was wrong. I was very impressed with the amount of mathematical vocabulary I heard, along with the discoveries that the students were able to discern on their own. This comic really pushed students to remember what they knew about percentages and then explain their reasoning to other students.",,

56,A Percentage Increase Is Needed on Homework! - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Jerome, Indiana",,
57,A Percentage Increase Is Needed on Homework! - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"My sixth-grade prealgebra students attacked the problems about percentage change and heatedly debated the first question! A students first response carefully explained that 30 divided by 5 was 6, so that meant it was a 600 percent change. Another student explained that 0.01 was a percentage and therefore it was a 600 percent increase. The discussion continued with a third student stating that 5 was 100 percent and therefore 30 was 600 percent. Finally, a student noted that the first 100 percent should not be included in the increase and therefore the percentage increase was 500 percent.",,
58,A Percentage Increase Is Needed on Homework! - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The reason for a formula became apparent to the class as they recalled that percentage change is calculated by the amount of change divided by the original amount. Once convinced that percentage-change calculations followed a pattern, the remaining problems were conquered.",,
