"While building models to address questions about fractions, we explore the types of reasoning that naturally emerge and the environment that motivates students to engage in proof.  mMathematical understanding is  founded on reasoning; students must understand relationships to make connections to new ideas (Ball and Bass 2003). This view of mathematics as reasoning is in contrast with the view of mathematics as a rule-oriented activity (Yackel and Hanna 2003). In fact, teaching algorithms only can be detrimental and counterproductive to the development of numerical reasoning. This is because students often erroneously remember algorithms and rely on these rules more than their own thinking. ",2,mtms2009-09-108a,,
"Reasoning flourishes when students are given the opportunity to share their thinking in a community of learners. Their mathematical understanding is based on the relationship between individual student activities and overall classroom practices (Cobb 2000). Thus, the classroom microculture has a major influence on the meaning that students make of mathematics, as well as their use of explanations. In fact, there is increasing evidence that in a supportive environment, all students, as early as  elementary school, can and do make ",3,mtms2009-09-108a,,

"In a student-centered classroom, such as the one described here, students  rather than teachers are the ones doing mathematics. They are building on their own and their classmates’ prior knowledge and previous experiences to make sense of the mathematics. Through this sense-making environment, they conceptualize and internalize the mathematical ideas and take ownership of the entire process.  and refute claims and participate in inductive and deductive reasoning (Maher 2005; Maher and Martino 1996; Yackel and Hanna 2003). However, reasoning that leads to proof does not happen spontaneously. It is elicited by the teacher’s expectations for students to explain their thinking, convince others in the community, and justify their ideas (Maher 2009). Thus, teacher questioning is crucial in promoting detailed, efficient representations and justifications.",13,mtms2009-09-108a,,
"In this article, we share an episode from an after-school program and focus on eight of the twenty-four urban, sixth-grade students who volunteered to work on mathematical problem solving. When students are given a supportive environment, open-ended tasks, and thoughtful teacher questioning, their reasoning can develop naturally. By analyzing their reasoning as they explain and justify solutions, successful strategies that promote reasoning and justification can be learned.  table 1 challenges posed during the first five sessions session",14,mtms2009-09-108a,,

"Effective tasks evoke a variety of responses and challenge students to extend their knowledge. Table 1 outlines the tasks that were used during the five sessions of the after-school program. These tasks were developed as a component of an earlier yearlong teaching experiment on fractions with a class of fourth-grade students (Steencken and Maher 2002, 2003). (For a detailed list of tasks and sequences, see Bulgar 2002; Mueller 2007; Reynolds 2005; and Steencken 2001.)",22,mtms2009-09-108a,,
"Although the fraction content was at an elementary level, students exhibited a variety of forms of reasoning in building ideas about fractions. Since our goal was to promote collaborative reasoning and problem solving, we chose these tasks to use during the initial sessions because we believed that they would promote this collaboration. This was the first time that these students were asked to work collaboratively on open-ended tasks.",23,mtms2009-09-108a,,
"To create models of solutions to the tasks, students were each given a set of Cuisenaire® Rods, ten rods that increase in length by one-centimeter increments (see fig. 1). Since the students were not accustomed to using these manipulatives, they were initially given thirty minutes of free time to explore the rods and make observations.  the classRooM enviRonMent",24,mtms2009-09-108a,,
"A classroom community that supports sharing ideas and knowledge is imperative to the development of mathematical understanding. Minimal, carefully planned teacher interventions can empower students to take ownership of their learning and solutions. Thus, the responsibility for learning shifts to the students. ",25,mtms2009-09-108a,,
"After an initial task was posed, students worked independently in small groups of four. They were given time to explore, build models of their solutions, ",26,mtms2009-09-108a,,

"Fig. 2 one group’s presentation contained each member’s contribution, as the different handwriting styles show.  talk about and explain their ideas to one another, and listen to alternative solutions with minimal teacher input. Groups were asked to document their ideas and models using an overhead transparency (see fig. 2). The teacher  moved around the room and listened attentively to students’ ideas, encouraging them to share solutions with one another and, as appropriate, build other arguments. The intention was to give students the autonomy to take  ownership of their learning and allow them to decide if a solution was valid and if the reasoning was sound.",28,mtms2009-09-108a,,
"Students were asked to provide justifications for solutions within their small groups and then share their ideas with the larger community. Teacher questioning became crucial, as students were encouraged to create and defend justifications. The questions posed were intended to— •  help gain an understanding of student thinking (“I don’t understand”);  •  direct students’ attention to an  incomplete component of an argument (“I’m not convinced”);  •  maintain and promote student  thought about a mathematical idea (“What if we named the rod ‘10’?”);  •  allow students to consider the  arguments of others (“Did you see what Chanel did?”);  •  help students strengthen their explanation (“How can you convince the class?”);  •  broaden students’ knowledge (“Does that always work?”). ",29,mtms2009-09-108a,,
"During small-group and whole-class discussions, students were asked to listen to the ideas of others and compare them with their own strategies and models. For example, the teacher would ask who had a similar explanation or who had a different thought about the problem. Problems were often revisited to provide the time needed to reflect on the strategies of others. ",30,mtms2009-09-108a,,
Reasoning leading  to PRooF,31,mtms2009-09-108a,,
"The after-school sessions were videotaped, transcribed, and analyzed according to the forms of reasoning used by the students. (See Mueller 2007 for a detailed analysis of the forms of reasoning that emerged during the five sessions.) We found that students used four main types of reasoning when building arguments.",32,mtms2009-09-108a,,
"Problems were often revisited to provide the time needed to  reflect on the  strategies of others.  1.  Direct reasoning. “A direct proof is based on the assumption that the hypothesis contains enough information to allow the construction of a series of logically connected steps leading to the conclusion” (Cupillari 2005, p. 12). A direct proof takes this form: “If p, then q” or  p → q. In this model, if it is first assumed that p is true, then steps are taken to arrive at the conclusion that q is true (Fletcher and Patty 1995). When using the rods, for example, students would argue that the white rod was half the red rod because the length of two white rods was equivalent to the length of the red rod.  2.  Reasoning by contradiction. Also  known as the indirect method, this reasoning is based on the agreement that whenever a statement is true, its contrapositive is also true or that a statement is logically equivalent to its contrapositive. For example, p → q (if p, then q) is equivalent to (not q) → (not p); so if (not q) → (not p) is true, then p → q is also true (Cupillari 2005). While students were finding half the blue rod, some students reasoned that the blue rod was equivalent to nine white rods only. Nine is an odd number and cannot be evenly divided in half.  3.  Reasoning by cases. In the five sessions, students often considered  different cases with the Cuisenaire Rods when forming an argument. For the purpose of this study, justifications were coded as reasoning by cases when students defended an argument by defending separate instances. They defended an implication in the form p → q by identifying propositions p1, p2, . . . , pn and established each of the implications: p1 → q1, p2 → q2, pn → qn  Using all the rods, some students showed the “cases” of all the rods that had a rod that was half its length.   4.  Reasoning using upper and lower  bounds. Students were to identify bounds of a set and show that all elements under some attribute are either within the set, on the bounds, or outside the bounds. An upper bound of a subset is an element that is greater than or equal to every element in that set. A lower bound of a subset is an element that is less than or equal to every element in the set. In addition, when reasoning using a lower-bound and upper-bound argument, it must also be established that no elements in the set are outside the bounds. Using the Cuisenaire Rods, the students focused on the attribute of length; the set of rods are bounded by the smallest (white) and largest (orange). In this case, the white rod is considered the lower bound and the orange rod, the upper bound. All rods in the set are bounded by these two rods; there is no smaller or larger rod in the set.

We report on the work of two groups of four students who were videotaped. The highlighted episode occurred during the second meeting of the after-school program. ,34,mtms2009-09-108a,,

"Michael argued that the yellow rod and purple rod were half the blue rod. Shirelle agreed and built a model using the yellow rod and purple rod placed next to the blue rod (see fig. 3). Michael and Shirelle used direct, although faulty, reasoning to justify why the two rods could be named one-half (“the length of the purple rod and yellow rod are equivalent to the length of the blue rod; therefore, they are half of the blue rod”). ",38,mtms2009-09-108a,,
"The teacher did not correct either  student but instead asked Chanel what she thought. Chanel explained that two purple rods would be too small and two yellow rods would be too large, as her model shows in figure 4a. After hearing the students argue back and forth, the teacher said, “I’m hearing Shirelle say that these two could be halves.” As Chanel and Dante attempted to convince Shirelle and Michael that a rod whose length is half of the blue does not exist, they developed a justification using upper and lower bounds:",39,mtms2009-09-108a,,

"Chris, Jeffrey, Brittany, and Danielle were in group 2. Three of them began the task by building models of rod combinations that were equivalent to the length of the blue rod. Chris, however, lined up a train of nine white rods next to the blue rod (see fig. 5). Jeffrey added that the result of taking half of nine would yield a decimal or a remainder. While his group members worked on defining upper and lower bounds, Chris listened to the arguments, pointed to his model of nine white rods next to the blue rod, and explained: ",44,mtms2009-09-108a,,

"The students demonstrated several forms of reasoning in building their solutions, including direct arguments, contradictions, cases, and upper and lower bounds.

"It was interesting to note that the students did not use the learned rules or algorithms when beginning to work on the given tasks. They did, however, use their rules and procedures to back up their rod construction. Their attempts sometimes revealed the inadequacy of their rule and procedure understanding. For example, during the third session, a student at another table named the light green rod “0.3.” ",55,mtms2009-09-108a,,
Chanel: What’s 0.3 plus 0.3 plus 0.3?,56,mtms2009-09-108a,,

Chanel: The numerator is the one that changes; the denominator stays the same.,60,mtms2009-09-108a,,
"Instead of correcting the students, the teacher asked that they model their explanation using the rods and identify the numerator and denominator. She discussed another student’s response, “David says that if you add 0.3 plus 0.3 plus 0.3 you get what, David? He says that you get 0.9. What do the rest of you think?” ",61,mtms2009-09-108a,,
"As the sessions progressed, and  students became more comfortable sharing and talking about their ideas, they more readily corrected one another and challenged one another’s ideas. Students also began to pose challenges, first in their small groups and then to the class. For example, during the third session, Jeffrey posed the following challenge: “What’s the number name for red [when blue is named one]?” The students responded to Jeffrey’s challenge and immediately connected to and built on the task of naming the light green rod. They recreated the model used to name the light green rod, then removed a white rod. They reasoned that the light-green rod was named three-ninths and that the red rod was shorter by one white rod; therefore, the red rod would be named two-ninths.",62,mtms2009-09-108a,,
"The students seemed to thoroughly enjoy working on the tasks and “talking” math. Of the eight students studied, none were absent during the five sessions analyzed.  develoPing collaboRative Reasoning in YoUR classRooM",63,mtms2009-09-108a,,
"These sessions were conducted as a component of an after-school program that the students volunteered to attend. The sessions were an hour  and a half long, immediately following the regular school day. One might expect that at the end of the school day, students would be weary and unlikely to give up their time for mathematics. However, their engagement and participation were inspiring. In addition, the students expressed enjoyment working on the tasks and working with one another. They took pleasure in building models, defending their arguments, and trying to convince others of the reasonableness of their solutions. They were enthusiastic about sharing their models and solutions using the overhead projector. By the second session, students not only extended the given tasks but also posed their own tasks for peers to solve. ",64,mtms2009-09-108a,,
"We can only speculate about the reasons for the student’s engagement and commitment, but several factors seemed to play a role: 1.  The students were successful. 2.  Many of them had not previously experienced success in mathematics class.  3.  The after-school forum allowed  them to generate important ideas, which were accepted and seriously considered by peers and adults. 4.  A safe environment emerged in which students could take risks without fear of embarrassment or criticism. ",65,mtms2009-09-108a,,
"How did their ideas emerge? The students began by first building personal representations of their solution using numbers, drawings, and physical models. They shared these representations in their small groups, made conjectures about their ideas, justified their arguments, listened to the arguments of others, and either built an acceptable solution or revised their model on the basis of feedback from their peers. They then shared justifications with the larger group  and listened to the ideas of others. In subsequent sessions, they could revisit their arguments, reflect on their own and the ideas of others, and repeat the process. They clearly took ownership of their solutions. ",66,mtms2009-09-108a,,
"It is our view that the success of these students mirrors the vision offered by the NCTM (2000), which calls for students to be engaged in problem-solving by using reasoning, making conjectures, creating representations, and communicating through the entire process. ",67,mtms2009-09-108a,,
