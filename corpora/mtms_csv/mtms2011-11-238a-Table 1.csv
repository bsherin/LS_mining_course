"Teacher wWith the ever-changing dynamics  challenges for teachers. Teaching mathematics to ELLs can be particularly challenging. Mathematics contains many of the same challenges as other subjects and can be perceived as being less diffi cult because it is based on the language of numbers. However, as Janzen (2008) asserts, mathematics instruction is often oral, and knowledge is attained through  of society, teachers are often faced with a classroom of students who have diverse linguistic and academic needs. Research has shown that schools are becoming more linguistically diverse throughout the United States (Beavers and D’Amico 2005) and that English language learners (ELLs) are posing their own sets of  conrado L. Gómez, Terri L. kurz, and Margarita Jimenez-Silva language; therefore, linguistic demands are as signifi cant in mathematics as in other content areas. Freeman and Crawford (2008) point out that language in mathematics is complex and that ELLs must contend with two types of language: the language of words and the language of symbols.",5,mtms2011-11-238a,,
"Despite the many daunting challenges that occur when teaching ELLs, mathematics teachers should remain vigilant when addressing their needs. Readers will be shown ways to adjust word problems to better meet the linguistic needs of ELLs. What follows are two examples of word problems written in a traditional format and rewritten in an adjusted format reducing linguistic demands while maintaining rigor. The framework can be used by teachers to support their ELLs by modifying word problems to focus more on the mathematics.  guidelines for adjusting  Word Problems for ells",6,mtms2011-11-238a,,
"The U.S. Department of Education’s Office of English Language Acquisition, Language Enhancement, and Academic Achievement for Limited English  Proficient Students published a series of guidelines on how to simplify  language without distorting meaning (OELA 2005). The guidelines  included these strategies: ·  Write shorter sentences. Make sentences as short as you can to simplify  the linguistic demands without compromising the academic content.  ·  Simplify the vocabulary. Make sure to incorporate words that ELLs have  already used in your classroom. A word problem should not be the first place in which ELLs encounter a new vocabulary word.",7,mtms2011-11-238a,,
·  Simplify the grammar. State word problems in the active voice instead of the passive voice to aid ELLs’ comprehension. It is also beneficial to use simple tenses when possible.,8,mtms2011-11-238a,,
"·  Rework the sentence entirely, if necessary. In numerous cases, changing a  sentence in a superficial way is not enough. You may need to write a new sentence, making sure to preserve the original meaning. In some cases, you may want to eliminate extraneous material.  ·  Add additional language for clarification. A simple example or rephrasing  can help make the meaning clearer.  ·  Repeat words if it will help clarify the statement. ELLs can benefit more  from repetition than from the introduction of new, unknown words.",9,mtms2011-11-238a,,
"·  Use cohesive devices (e.g., then, such, first, however, it, also). By using cohesive ties, students receive clues as to the structure of the question as a whole. This helps students understand the logical relationships among elements in the question and aids students’ general comprehension. ",10,mtms2011-11-238a,,
"This list of strategies illustrates that adjusting word problems can be a complex endeavor when considering vocabulary, sentence structure, complex phrases, and word choice (Abedi and Lord 2001).  stRUctURed english iMMeRsion The Content Standards assume that students have attained a certain level of English proficiency (NCTM 2000). When mathematics educators assume that all students have the same level of oral English proficiency, they erroneously presume that all it takes to teach ELLs is simply good teaching practices. Consequently, most mathematics education programs do not emphasize the instructional skills that content teachers need to address and meet the needs of ELLs (Freeman and Crawford 2008).",11,mtms2011-11-238a,,
"However, there are ways to address language development to support ELLs’ journey of learning the English language. In structured English immersion (SEI) courses, education students learn about language development and how language varies according to the context in which it is used. They are taught that it is easier to learn language that is embedded in the visual context provided by manipulatives, other visual cues, and hands-on demonstrations and activities (Gibbons 2002), which are elements commonly used in the mathematics curriculum. They also find that ELLs are supposed to learn English as well as other  subjects in English. ELLs need access to a continuous language-focused program across all subjects, including mathematics. Furthermore, simple exposure to English does not guarantee that ELLs will learn both the academic language and mathematics content. Consequently, the mathematics educator needs to understand that integrating content and language requires systematic planning (Gibbons 2002). The mathematics classroom is an excellent environment in which to learn a second language because the context provided in a mathematics word problem, for example, allows the language components germane to mathematics to be emphasized.",12,mtms2011-11-238a,,
"This goal of addressing both  subject content and English language development means that activities should address both mathematics and language goals. The mathematics educator must learn how to integrate language into all activities, something that takes experience and practice. Because listening to and understanding language are essential elements for English language acquisition, teachers can provide the means and the environment for ELLs to learn language in context. When teachers design appropriate activities, ELLs learn to communicate by using the language. This form of instruction is more useful than asking students to merely study the language. Adjusting word problems to support both  mathematics and language acquisition can help ELLs use language as a form of communication.  adJUsting the langUage  oF WoRd PRoBleMs",13,mtms2011-11-238a,,
"ELLs must be held to the same challenging standards as other students and need to participate fully in the curriculum. ELLs need to participate in an educational program designed to enable them to acquire the requisite mathematics skills. However, as Echevarria, Vogt, and Short (2008, p. 79) indicate, when ELLs “are learning material in a language they do not yet speak or understand completely, they require specialized teaching techniques to make the message understood.” When an activity can be illustrated visually or by manipulating objects, students can comprehend the concept without the spoken word. ELLs frequently have difficulty understanding language that is spoken rapidly or contains idioms. For example, the statement “Way to go!” means that someone performed well, not that he or she knows the directions. Whenever a concept or skill can be illustrated, the language barrier is lessened and ELLs benefit.",14,mtms2011-11-238a,,
"Mathematics, by its very nature,  lends itself to this type of instruction because tools are often used successfully to support its instruction (Furner, Yahya, and Duffy 2005). Although these accommodations are advantageous, they are not the only adjustments that can help. Modifying linguistic demands of word problems can also be beneficial. However, while reducing the complexity of the sentences and the chosen words, the mathematical demands can remain at the same academic level (Bielenberg and Fillmore 2004). ",15,mtms2011-11-238a,,
"Although reducing the linguistic  demands may seem to be detrimental to language development, it can also be viewed as beneficial. Instead of  focusing on decoding numerous words and phrases, ELLs can better understand the context and meaning when they have fewer words to decipher. By adjusting word usage, language can still be learned in context, which helps ELLs see the words used properly and in typical educational situations. However, this strategy should be viewed as a temporary scaffolding action until students have developed proficiency in the academic language of mathematics.",16,mtms2011-11-238a,,
"Martiniello (2008) analyzed the text of mathematics word problems and found that there were many different language factors that influence understanding. She found that the syntax and vocabulary of word problems do not favor ELLs. In terms of syntax, limiting factors to ELLs included multiple clauses, long noun phrases, and unclear text. In terms of vocabulary, factors that gave ELLs difficulty included a lack of understanding of words, words with multiple meanings, idioms, and cognates. With Martiniello’s findings in mind, it is important that teachers of ELLs learn how to adapt word problems to address some of these language barriers.",17,mtms2011-11-238a,,

"After reviewing the U.S. Department of Education guidelines (2005), a seasoned middle school mathematics teacher adapted this item (see fig. 1b) by simplifying the grammar, as suggested by the OELA. (See the sidebar.) By changing the verb tense in the first sentence from past progressive to future tense, English learners are more likely to understand the meaning of the sentence, since it is a tense form that is more commonly understood. Mr. Jacob’s was removed as it was unnecessary mathematically. The teacher also used the term oral reports more often in  his class than the term speeches and therefore incorporated the academic language that was familiar to the students. In so doing, he minimized the number of unfamiliar words for students.",26,mtms2011-11-238a,,
"He also repeated the term oral  reports in each sentence, following OELA’s advice to repeat words if it will help clarify the statement.
