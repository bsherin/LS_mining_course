"The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) employs a process called plurality with elimination to select the Academy Award for Best Picture. Voters rank the nominees as first place, second place, third place, and so on. A movie wins if it receives over 50% of the firstplace votes. If there is no winner, the movie with the smallest number of first-place votes is removed from the list. For the voters who ranked the discarded movie in first place, their second-place movies will receive additional first-place votes. Again, if no movie has more than 50% of the first-place votes, the movie with the smallest number of first-place votes is removed. The process continues until a movie has garnered 50% of the votes.",4,mtms2012-11-256a,,
