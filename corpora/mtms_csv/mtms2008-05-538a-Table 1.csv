"Literature in the Mathematics Classroom: introducing The Inch Boy  to Middle school students iI was sitting in a faculty meeting  when my principal suggested that teachers of all disciplines should read to their students. I remember thinking to myself, These are middle school students. They should know how to read already. My principal continued by explaining that reading aloud to a class is an excellent and effective way to instill the love of literature in students. I was doubtful, and thought, I’m a math teacher. We don’t have time to read books in math. As if he were reading my mind, the principal gave examples of how teachers of all disciplines, including mathematics, could incorporate literature into their lessons. I was skeptical but decided to give it a try.",2,mtms2008-05-538a,,
"My students were about to begin  ties associated with it. One activity involved computing the mean and determining the median and mode of the height (in inches) of the students in the class, which my students were readily able to do. ",3,mtms2008-05-538a,,
"The next day, I brought in a book titled The Inch Boy (Morimoto 1991) and read it aloud to students. The story discusses Issunboshi, a one-inch tall Japanese boy, and his quest to become a Samurai warrior and serve a noble lord. After reading it aloud, I was amazed by The Inch Boy’s ability to motivate and engage my students. ",4,mtms2008-05-538a,,
"What significance did this book have for the mathematics classroom? The main character, Issunboshi, and his one-inch size served as a way to introduce the notion of outliers in data sets. Having already calculated the mean, median, and mode for the heights in the class, students were told that the  susan Foss, sfoss@derbyps.org, is the dean of students at Derby Middle School/High School in Derby, CT 06418. She taught middle school mathematics for ten years. She is interested in finding unique ways for students to learn, especially those who have experienced difficulty in mathematics. She is also interested in using literature to teach middle school mathematics.",5,mtms2008-05-538a,,
"a unit on statistics, which opened with the study of measures of central tendency: mean, median, and mode. This unit had many engaging activi-",6,mtms2008-05-538a,,
Fig. 1 Students compute the mean when Issunboshi joined the class.,7,mtms2008-05-538a,,
"character Issunboshi was a new student. They were then asked to recalculate the class mean with Issunboshi included (see fig. 1), which allowed them to determine the effects that an outlier has on the mean. With the introduction of the one-inch Issunboshi to the lesson, students were able to determine that this type of outlier (a very small number compared with the rest of the data set) decreased the mean. It is clear in figure 1 that students were also able to verbalize why the mean decreased: “Because he is so small. And you have to divide by another number.” This discovery led to a discussion of misleading statistics. Did this new mean that was calculated with Issunboshi added to the list really represent our “average” class height? I asked the students to think of other real-world examples in which an outlier would dramatically change the mean.",8,mtms2008-05-538a,,
"The students were then asked to  determine the effect that Issunboshi would have on the median and mode (see fig. 2). When discussing the effect that Issunboshi had on the median, the students often reported that the median stayed the same or that it decreased. Of course, either answer could be correct. The new median, resulting from the addition of Issunboshi, was dependent on the data set that represented the class. For example, if the data set, calculated in inches, was 59, 60, 60, 62, 63, 64, 64, 65, 65, the original median would be 63 inches. If Issunboshi were added to the list, the data set would be 1, 59, 60, 60, 62, 63, 64, 64, 65, 65, making the median 62.5 inches. In this case, the median decreased. If the data set had been 59, 60, 60, 62, 62, 64, 64, 65, the original median would be 62 inches. Adding Issunboshi, the set would be 1, 59, 60, 60, 62, 62, 64, 64, 65, and the median would still be  62 inches. The effect of an outlier on the median is not an easy concept for students to understand. It is evident in one student response in figure 2 (“Yes, because there is the same number in the middle.”) that although the student was able to compute the new median, she did not yet conceptually understand what was happening mathematically. Since the new median was dependent on the original data set, I encouraged my students to respond that the median was to the left of the original median (making it either equal to or less than the original median).",9,mtms2008-05-538a,,
"When computing the mode, the students responded excitedly, “Issunboshi doesn’t change the mode. He’s the only one that’s one inch tall!” Since the mode was the number that occurred most often in a data set, Issunboshi would not change the mode because he would be the only ",10,mtms2008-05-538a,,

Questions posed with this lesson provided a basis for group discussion and contributed to excellent opportunities to write in mathematics class: •	 Explain why the mean decreases  when Issunboshi is added to the class.,15,mtms2008-05-538a,,
•	 Does the median always decrease when a very small outlier is added to the class list? Give examples.,16,mtms2008-05-538a,,
"•	 Can a single outlier be added to the class list to change the mode? Why or why not? •	 How can a company that is trying to hire new employees use outliers to mislead prospective workers into thinking that the mean salary of the company is higher than it really is? •	 Which statistic—mean, median, or mode—would be the best measure of central tendency to use with the  addition of the outlier? Explain your reasoning. ",17,mtms2008-05-538a,,
"As a follow-up to this lesson, I introduced another new student to the class, the Statue of Liberty, which happens to be 111 feet, 1 inch tall from heel to head. Using our original class data (Issunboshi not included), the students were asked to make predictions about the effects the Statue of Liberty would have on the mean, median, and mode. Students immediately answered, “The mean is definitely going to be greater!” and “The mode will not change, just like it didn’t change with Issunboshi.” The students then verified their predictions by calculating the new mean, median, and mode. They generalized that the mean would always increase when a very large outlier was added to the data set and that the outlier would have no effect on the mode.",18,mtms2008-05-538a,,
After seeing that the addition of ,19,mtms2008-05-538a,,
"Issunboshi to the class forced the new median to move to the left of the original median, the students were able to infer that the addition of the Statue of Liberty would force the new median to move to the right of the original median (making it greater than or equal to the original median, depending on the data set). Because there is no clear-cut “rule” for what happens to the median when a large outlier is added to the data set, I asked the students to conjecture, which is a higherlevel thinking skill, and then test their conjectures. The students showed greater understanding of this concept than they had earlier in the unit. In figure 3, a student wrote, “Yes it will be the same because there are four 63’s. And even if there is one more number,  the next number is still 63 if you move to the right.” Just as with Issunboshi, I took advantage of this opportunity to show students that there are situations in which the median would increase with the addition of a large outlier and other examples where it would stay the same. The outcome was dependent on the original data set. ",20,mtms2008-05-538a,,
"Last, the students were asked to  examine what would happen if Issunboshi and the Statue of Liberty were both added to the class (see fig. 4). I asked students to make predictions about the mean, median, and mode before actually performing the calculations. By this point in the unit, most students were able to accurately predict the outcome and also justify these predictions with convincing arguments. In figure 4, students said that the median “will be the same because we added a number to each end.” The students’ basic knowledge about statistics was elevated so that they had a conceptual understanding of why and how these changes were occurring.",21,mtms2008-05-538a,,
I will continue to look for other  examples of literature that are untapped sources of mathematical possibilities. My principal was right: Teachers of all disciplines should read to their students. ,22,mtms2008-05-538a,,
