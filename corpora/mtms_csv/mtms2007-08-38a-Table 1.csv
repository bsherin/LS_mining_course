Using Pattern Tasks to Develop Mathematical Understandings and Set Classroom Norms,0,mtms2007-08-38a,,
"Margaret S. Smith, Amy F. Hillen,   and Christy L. Catania tThe capacity to reason algebraically  is critical in shaping students’ future opportunities and, as such, is a central theme of K–12 education (NCTM 2000). One component of algebraic reasoning is “the capacity to recognize patterns and organize data to represent situations in which input is related to output by well-defined functional rules” (Driscoll 1999, p. 2). Geometric pattern tasks can be a useful tool for helping students develop algebraic reasoning, because the tasks provide students with opportunities to build patterns with materials such as toothpicks or pattern blocks. These materials help students “focus on the physical changes and how the pattern is being developed” (Friel, Rachlin, and Doyle 2001, p. 10). Such work might help bridge students’ earlier mathematical experiences and lay the foundation for more formal work in algebra (English and Warren 1998; Ferrini-Mundy, Lappan, and Phillips 1997; NCTM 2000). Finally, the relationships between the quantities in pattern tasks can be expressed using symbols, tables, and graphs, as well as words. Thus, pattern tasks can also give students opportunities to make connections among representations—a key compo-",1,mtms2007-08-38a,,

Teachers work together to identify tasks from a variety of sources (e.g., journals, materials from teachers’ master’s-level course work and professional development experiences, and other curricular materials) and decide which tasks to use at each grade level to ensure that students explore different ones each year.

"In addition, students who have  opportunities to explore and discuss relatively simple linear patterns, such as the Upside Down T Pattern, will be able to draw on their work as they encounter more complex items, such as the S Pattern task (shown in  fig. 3), which grows in two directions. For example, students who created solutions such as those in figure 2a or 2b (in which the Upside Down T was broken into different chunks) might try a similar strategy for the S Pattern (e.g., breaking the S into a top row of size (n + 1); a bottom row of size (n + 1); and a rectangle, or square, with dimensions n × n). Since strategies are shared publicly, all students have opportunities to make sense of and draw on a range of different strategies in subsequent work.  tasks can be revisited Pattern tasks that are explored at the beginning of the school year can become memorable for students and can be referenced as the year progresses. In so doing, these tasks further develop students’ understandings of key algebraic ideas. For example, once students have some experience graphing linear equations in two variables, students could draw a graph that shows the number of tiles in each step as a function of the step number in the Upside Down T Pattern task.

"three different symbolic ways of expressing the relationship between the step number and the number of tiles in each step (shown in fig. 2). From a mathematical perspective, this also provides an opportunity to discuss why these expressions are equivalent and how you could justify it. For example, in justifying why the expressions that generalize the relationship in the Upside Down T Pattern  n + 2(n – 1), 3(n – 1) + 1, and 3n – 2 are equivalent, students would have opportunities to use algebraic skills, such as combining like terms, using the distributive property, and substituting values for n in each expression and determining whether all the expressions produce the same answer.

"In addition, as students explore  pattern tasks individually and in small groups, the teacher can challenge them to determine different ways of viewing, describing, and generalizing the pattern. Thus, students learn that  the teacher values different ways of thinking about the same problem, and that solving a task in one way is not sufficient.

"Generating and sharing multiple solutions also provides a way to help students learn how to participate in the classroom community. For example, instead of the teacher beginning the school year by giving students a list of classroom rules, students learn important norms and practices through participation in a community where the practices are reinforced as students engage in mathematical work. For example, beginning on the first day of the pattern unit (usually the first day of school), students are assigned to groups and encouraged to both talk with and listen to one another. Students are consistently asked to look for alternative ways to solve problems and to question the teacher and one another when they do not understand. Students realize that the teacher is a source of support and encouragement but is not someone who is there just to give out answers.   Sharing solutions also serves to establish key aspects of classroom culture. To illustrate how norms and practices such as accountability, clarity, and respect might be established, we zoom in on a classroom in which students are sharing solutions to the Garden Pattern task (shown in  fig. 4).

"Several aspects of these excerpts  are noteworthy. First, students explain and clarify their thinking with the help of comments and questions posed by the teacher. For example, in the beginning of her explanation, Beth tells the class to “multiply by two and add six.” The teacher then asks, “You multiply what by two?”—a question that helped to clarify Beth’s initial statement. In addition, after Faith demonstrates her method on step 1, the teacher presses her for further clarification by commenting, “OK, I don’t think they [the students in the class] understood that.” With help from the teacher, Faith then provides an explanation that is more clearly connected to the pattern. The teacher also ensures that a clear written record of students’ thinking is created by asking students to draw and record their ideas on the transparency. Through these moves, students also learn which aspects of their explanations should be recorded so that everyone in the class can understand the presented strategy. ",156,mtms2007-08-38a,,
"In addition, students in the class  are held accountable for making sense of solutions presented by others. For example, during Beth’s presentation, the teacher asks other students to help clarify statements made by Beth and Adam. After Faith demonstrates her method on the first step of the pattern, the teacher holds students accountable by asking if anyone can apply Faith’s strategy to find the number of squares in the next step in the pattern. In response to this query, Caitlyn explains Faith’s method on the second step of the pattern. Thus, students learn that they are responsible not only for explaining their own thinking but also for carefully listening to, making sense of, and explaining the ideas shared by other students in the class. ",157,mtms2007-08-38a,,
"During this discussion, the class is also developing important norms regarding respect. The teacher shows respect for her students’ mathematical abilities by positioning them as authors of mathematical work. For example, when Faith offers an explanation that the teacher feels may be unclear to other students in the class, the teacher presses Faith to continue her explanation, instead of taking over the explanation for her. Students also show respect for one another’s thinking by applying other students’ solution strategies.",158,mtms2007-08-38a,,
"Finally, important mathematical ideas are publicly made during the discussion. For example, the solution strategies shared by Beth, Faith, and Phoebe are explicit forms of pattern generalization (Friel, Rachlin, and Doyle 2001) (rather than recursive strategies). That is, the students’ generalizations represent the relationship between the step number and the number of white tiles such that the input is related to the output by a well-defined functional rule (Driscoll 1999). For example, Beth notes that “you multiply [the number of black squares] by two and add six.” ",159,mtms2007-08-38a,,
"In addition, students are encouraged to make connections between representations—an activity that helps students make sense of relationships such as linear functions (Friel, Rachlin, and Doyle 2001) and develop a more robust understanding of functions (Knuth 2000). In their work on the Garden Pattern task, the teacher presses students to make connections between their generalizations and the geometry of the pattern.  conclusion",160,mtms2007-08-38a,,
"As we have demonstrated in the article, pattern tasks can provide rich opportunities for students to begin to explore relationships between variables and patterns of change. In addition, as one teacher noted, pattern tasks can help set the tone for the school year by helping students “get used to how you run your classes that might be different from other math experiences.” It is also important to note that students at Bellfield Middle School appear to recognize the benefits of the pattern unit. For example, one student noted, “Starting with [the pattern unit] made me feel more comfortable in class. I know I can ask questions and not feel stupid. Now I feel encouraged to participate and I enjoy math more.” Another student commented, “I was never good at math and I always started out dreading math class. This year I have new hope because I’m allowed to think differently and I’m having success. I look forward to coming to class every day now.”",161,mtms2007-08-38a,,
"So how does one start such a pattern revolution? At Bellfield Middle School, the pattern revolution began with one teacher sharing her students’ work on geometric pattern tasks with colleagues. This student work provided an opportunity for teachers to have grounded conversations about what students were able to do mathematically. Other teachers were intrigued by the pattern tasks, and one by one  began asking the teacher to share them. As the pattern unit has evolved over time, teachers have had opportunities to draw on a shared experience that has served as the basis for conversations in the teachers’ lounge and at department meetings, as well as a platform for further collaboration and discussion. ",162,mtms2007-08-38a,,
"It is interesting to note that the teachers at Bellfield Middle School have recently adopted a reform- oriented curriculum—due in part, they claim, to their opportunities to witness firsthand what students can do mathematically when posed with high-level tasks during the pattern unit. Despite the adoption of the new curriculum, teachers continue to launch the school year with the pattern unit, since they feel that it serves important mathematical and social purposes.
