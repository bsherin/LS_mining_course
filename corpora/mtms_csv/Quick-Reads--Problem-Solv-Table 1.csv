3,Quick Reads: Problem Solving with Laser Precision,"Engaging all students in mathematics has been an age-old challenge that has become increasingly difficult in the twenty-first century. Remarkable new technologies—smart phones, tablet computers, and video games—have further eroded students’ attention spans. The traditional method of a teacher-centered classroom with students plugging away on endless activity sheets is a thing of the past. Creating a student-centered, inquiry-driven classroom is essential to reinvigorating students so that they can actively engage in learning mathematics.

4,Quick Reads: Problem Solving with Laser Precision,"To prepare students to succeed  in the future by simply memorizing formulas and algorithms would be a disservice. Since the world is ever changing, those students who learn problem solving as well as interpersonal skills and critical-thinking skills will be the most successful. How, then, are teachers to prepare students to be successful problem solvers and critical thinkers? ",4,Quick Reads: Problem Solving with Laser Precision

Lessons are developed around a central problem or question, thus allowing students to work cooperatively toward a solution. By taking a problem-solving approach, students are building not only interpersonal skills but also critical-thinking skills (Hmelo-Silver 2004). As students progress, they will have a context with which to apply mathematical reasoning, and mathematics will become purposeful.  creating a PurPose",6,Quick Reads: Problem Solving with Laser Precision

9,Quick Reads: Problem Solving with Laser Precision,"years past, I have done what many other teachers have done: Write an example problem on the board and assign countless problems from the textbook and assorted activity sheets. I noticed that my students would become successful at completing the activity sheets with astounding accuracy, but their understanding was weak. Within a week or two, the memorized skill was forgotten because it had been taught out of context. That is when it clicked for me: If I wanted my students to understand mathematics, I would need to provide a purpose and a context. ",9,Quick Reads: Problem Solving with Laser Precision
10,Quick Reads: Problem Solving with Laser Precision,"To engage the students, I directed a laser pointer at a mirror on the floor, with the reflection hitting the 12 on a clock positioned above the classroom door. I posed the simple question, “Who can explain what is happening?” Knowing that my students had just completed a unit on the electro- magnetic spectrum and light in science class, I was confident that this would be a conversation starter. As a class discussion progressed, students expanded on one another’s ideas, with each student adding more and more detail to the science and mathematics behind this relatively basic phenomenon. By the end of the discussion, the students had made a drawing on the board, showing how light reflected off the mirror forming two similar triangles.  guiding inquiry",10,Quick Reads: Problem Solving with Laser Precision
11,Quick Reads: Problem Solving with Laser Precision,"Students were then divided into groups of three or four and given a mirror, laser pointer, and meterstick and asked to measure the heights of flags hanging along the ceiling in the school gymnasium. Students were given minimal instruction and were asked to devise and execute a plan to determine the measurements. Most groups jumped at the opportunity and the freedom in such an inquiry-based lesson; however, some of my “best” ",11,Quick Reads: Problem Solving with Laser Precision

13,Quick Reads: Problem Solving with Laser Precision,"students were hesitant to take on the activity. They hesitated because it involved much more work; it involved problem solving. With students taking ownership of the problem, they were able to make concrete connections to the mathematics and science involved in indirect measurement.

14,Quick Reads: Problem Solving with Laser Precision,"As part of the activity, students  were asked to detail how their groups solved the problem and include a labeled diagram representing their experiments (see an illustration in fig. 1). Once these tasks were accomplished, students were given the actual heights of the flags and asked to calculate the percentage error. They then reflected on what could have been done differently to get a more accurate answer in the future. ",14,Quick Reads: Problem Solving with Laser Precision

16,Quick Reads: Problem Solving with Laser Precision,"To further develop my students’ understanding of indirect measurement, I assigned an additional task: Find the width of the soccer goal outside our school. Having the students brainstorm solutions and then actually go outside and implement their ideas provided a context to engage even the most difficult-to-reach students.

18,Quick Reads: Problem Solving with Laser Precision,"The students’ solutions to this  problem were both creative and feasible. One group proposed using the Pythagorean theorem (see fig. 2). Another group of students knew that the ratio of height to width of a soccer goal was 1:3. Using this fact, the students then developed a method using shadows from the sun and similar triangles to calculate the height of the goal. Once the group established the height, students determined that they could set up a proportion to solve for ",18,Quick Reads: Problem Solving with Laser Precision

Although these solutions were  reasonable and had addressed the given problem, they did not include the paper towel roll. I wanted to expand on my students’ problem-solving abilities so I encouraged them to look through the paper towel roll and develop a possible relationship between the size of the roll and what they saw when looking through it. After I posed some guiding questions and encouraged creative thinking, most groups proposed the relationships shown in figure 4. As I moved among the students,  I heard many different proposals. In one magical moment, I realized that every student was actively engaged. They were grappling with an activity that fostered problem solving, critical thinking, and interpersonal skills. By creating a student-centered, inquirydriven classroom, students had become re-engaged with learning math. ",22,Quick Reads: Problem Solving with Laser Precision
