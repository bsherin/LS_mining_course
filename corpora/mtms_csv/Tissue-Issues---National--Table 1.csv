0,Tissue Issues - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Every day, 27,000 trees are used to make bathroom tissue. Americans use an average of 23.6 rolls per person per year, and more than 7 billion rolls of toilet paper are sold yearly in the United States alone. Perhaps we can reduce the amount of bathroom tissue used by changing the dimensions of the paper or the core.",,
1,Tissue Issues - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"1. Recently, the size of toilet paper changed from the standard 4.5 in. Ã— 4.5 in. The width (the length of the cardboard core) changed to 4.1 inches, and the length of one sheet changed to 3.7 inches.",,
2,Tissue Issues - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"a. If a roll has 132 sheets, how much longer is the standard roll than the new when unrolled?",,
3,Tissue Issues - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,b. How far will 23.6 rolls of the new paper stretch if unrolled?,,
4,Tissue Issues - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,c. How much smaller is the area of one new sheet than the original? Express the new area as a percentage of the standard area.,,
5,Tissue Issues - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"2. If we place a roll of toilet paper so that the cardboard core is vertical, then the top view will appear as shown. This washer-shape region is called an annulus.",,
6,Tissue Issues - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
7,Tissue Issues - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"a. If the radius of the core is 0.836 inch, and the radius of the roll is 1.875 inches, what is the area of the annulus?",,
8,Tissue Issues - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"b. If the height of the core is 4.1 inches, what is the volume of the paper used?",,
9,Tissue Issues - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"3. If a double roll contains twice as much paper, what will be the radius of the double roll?",,
10,Tissue Issues - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,4. A way to reduce the amount of paper on a roll is to enlarge the core.,,
11,Tissue Issues - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"a. If the cardboard core of a single roll is enlarged to have a radius of 1 inch while the radius of the roll remains 1.875 inches, what is the new volume of the paper?",,
12,Tissue Issues - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,b. How much smaller is the volume of this roll than the original? Express the reduced volume as a percentage of your answer to 2(b).,,
