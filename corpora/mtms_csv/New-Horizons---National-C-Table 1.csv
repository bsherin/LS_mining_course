0,New Horizons - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The  New Horizonsspaceship launched from Earth on January 19, 2006, to study Pluto and its moons.New Horizonsmade its closest approach to the Pluto system on July 14, 2015, more than 9.5 years later, having traveled more than 3 billion miles. This distance is hard to visualize. One way to visualize large distances is to use familiar lengths and ratios. For example, theDeepsea Challenger(a submersible vehicle) traveled 10,994 meters to reach the bottom of the Mariana Trench. The depth of the trench is about the same length as 100 football fields, lined end to end (since each football field is about 110 meters long).",,
1,New Horizons - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,1. Use a distance you are familiar with to describe the distance of the  New Horizons  trip. You may want to say something like â€œ3 billion miles is the same distance as __________ trips from ________________________ to _______________________â€ or â€œ3 billion miles is the same distance as ____________________________________________________.â€,,
