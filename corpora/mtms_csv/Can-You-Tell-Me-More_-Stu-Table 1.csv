0,Can You Tell Me More_ Student Journaling and Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Journaling in mathematics has been found to be a valuable tool both for students and for teachers. Students benefit from journaling because it advances their mathematical understanding and ability to communicate in mathematics; teachers benefit by reading students’ written thoughts, a resource that is not readily available, and by engaging with students through written feedback (Albert and Antos 2000). I sought to use journaling to further develop reasoning and sense making (CCSSI 2010; NCTM 2010, 2014) through teacher and student responses to each other in journals. In so doing, I also wanted to promote students’ critiques of one another’s thinking and written mathematical discourse.",,

2,Can You Tell Me More_ Student Journaling and Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"This work occurred in a mathematics class that focused on algebra. Each week, one class period was dedicated to “lab time,” which included inquiry-based lessons that applied to core course topics such as slope, data collection and analysis, and linear equations. These activities generated multiple opportunities for journal writing, resulting in 450 journal entries over a semester.",,
3,Can You Tell Me More_ Student Journaling and Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The Calculator Based Ranger 2 (CBR 2™) motion sensor activity, in particular, was well suited for journaling. As others have done in the past, students used the CBR 2 to investigate slope (Doerr, Rieff, and Tabor 1999). The motion sensor collects data in real time as students move in front of it. The data are then displayed on a graphing calculator. Distance from the motion sensor is plotted on the y-axis against elapsed-time on the x-axis. The class began with a demonstration of the use of the motion sensor at the front of the room. Students were then invited to break into smaller groups to experiment on their own by “playing around,” such as moving in front of the main sensor to become familiar with how it gathered data as they moved. First, I asked students to create lines of positive or negative slope with their movement. Then, the students had to match their movements to graphs generated by the CBR 2.",,
4,Can You Tell Me More_ Student Journaling and Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Before students were asked to physically match the graph, they wrote descriptions in their journals about what they predicted a student would have to do to match the graph. This allowed them time to make sense of what needed to happen after having worked just minutes before with the CBR 2. After completing their written descriptions, students exchanged papers with a partner and offered written feedback to one another. As shown in figure 1, initial entries were purely descriptive, but then progressed toward more conceptual aspects of mathematics. The work in example response 1 showed that the student recognized the importance of the y-intercept when offering descriptions (“start 2 feet away”) and hinted at slope when indicating movement (at an “average speed”). Once students offered their written descriptions to classmates, they realized the need to be specific with mathematical language so as to communicate necessary actions. Figure 2 illustrates a student’s understanding that he needed to include the y-intercepts and slope (2 seconds/1 foot) in subsequent entries.",,

7,Can You Tell Me More_ Student Journaling and Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"After sharing their predictions and feedback, students were prompted to compare one another’s predictions, as shown in figure 3. Although some student responses were vague (e.g., “My strategy was different”), other responses included more detail. The student entry in figure 3 recognized the benefit of using the y-intercept as a specific beginning point. The third journal entry (see fig. 4) was the last journal prompt of the day, and I used it to close the activity. At the end of each class, I collected all journals to read and write responses to each student. This practice allowed me to see how students were making sense of the concept and how they were responding to one another, thus providing me with another layer of assessment. It is important to note that journaling formed a type of written dialogue between students and teachers.",,

15,Can You Tell Me More_ Student Journaling and Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"This four-part interaction helped me better understand how Michelle was making sense of the motion sensor activity. Her mention of having to “think differently” refers to the fact that students have to think deeply before they move in front of the motion sensor to ensure that it will produce the desired graph. For example, to produce a graph with negative slope, a student starts at some distance away from the sensor and walks at a constant pace toward it. When doing the match-the-graph activity, all student movement takes place linearly in front of the sensor, but they are either walking forward, backward, or standing still. The graph produced, however, does not show a single line with one equation.",,
16,Can You Tell Me More_ Student Journaling and Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Michelle, as noted by her responses, was realizing that you had to “think differently” to garner the desired graph result. In addition to commending Michelle’s realization that “different thinking” was necessary, a better response would have included an additional question, asking her to explain what she meant by “think differently”:",,
17,Can You Tell Me More_ Student Journaling and Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,How did you “think differently to get the graph to show up”? Can you tell me more about what you mean by “think differently”? What mathematical terms may you include to help me better understand?,,
18,Can You Tell Me More_ Student Journaling and Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"It is worth noting that, beyond this assessment of students’ developing understandings (as Michelle’s writing indicates), journaling also gave me, the teacher, a personal connection with students through written dialogue, which became a recorded history of their reasoning and sense making throughout the course.",,
19,Can You Tell Me More_ Student Journaling and Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,RESPONSE TYPES,,
20,Can You Tell Me More_ Student Journaling and Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The journals allowed for two types of responses: student-to-student responses (e.g., Journal prompts 1 and 2) and teacher-to-student responses (e.g., Journal prompt 3).",,
21,Can You Tell Me More_ Student Journaling and Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Student-to-student responses: Having classmates exchange journals allowed students to discuss, in writing, their mathematical ideas. It encouraged them to construct viable arguments, promote reasoning, critique others’ reasoning, and engage in meaningful mathematical discourse (CCSSI 2010; NCTM 2014). I did find, however, that student-to-student feedback was not as detailed (see fig. 1). Similar to the examples above, students tended to agree with their classmates or ask for more detail but would not offer more specific feedback as to what detail would be helpful. I did see promise, however, in having students read and respond to one another’s thinking. It allowed them time to reason not only through their own responses but also through the responses of their classmates. I also noticed as the semester continued that students would sometimes model their feedback to classmates on the feedback I was offering them in their journals.",,
22,Can You Tell Me More_ Student Journaling and Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Teacher-to-student responses: When I returned journals, I gave them a few minutes to respond in writing to my inquiries. This time allowed students to review what we had discussed the week before and further explain their previous responses. Once they had time to respond, we would begin that week’s lab. The students became familiar with the routine and seemed excited to receive their journals with my feedback. I would then be able to read their new entries, based on that day’s lab, as well as their responses to my inquiries from the previous lab when I collected the journals from that day.",,
23,Can You Tell Me More_ Student Journaling and Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,CONCLUDING REMARKS,,
24,Can You Tell Me More_ Student Journaling and Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Journals provide a history of each student’s thinking over time and allow this history to be easy to review. Although I value exit slips and find them helpful for certain situations, they tend to be lost or forgotten after I review them. I sometimes used journals in place of exit slips, which allowed one central location for both the student and me to review their reasoning and sense making. Figure 5 summarizes some tips for encouraging more detailed student writing. With further development and modeling of what mathematical conversation looks like, teachers and students can continue to engage in high-quality mathematics that promotes the ideals set forth in Principles to Actions and CCSSM.",,
