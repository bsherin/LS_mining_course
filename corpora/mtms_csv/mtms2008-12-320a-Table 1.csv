The middle school section contains seven sets of 5 problems from five previous Math Olympiads (a total of 175 questions). The book also contains “Solutions” and “Hints” sections. Navigating among the various sections is hampered by the book’s lack of cross-referencing. Despite this weakness, the book would serve as a fine resource of extension activities or as a tool to prepare for mathematics competitions.",17,mtms2008-12-320a,,
