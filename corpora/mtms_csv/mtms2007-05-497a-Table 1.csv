"B eane  argues  persuasively  that  if  that none of it matters after the test. for this reason, Beane and other scholars (abt-perkins and pagnucci 1993; Dewey 1965; Drake 1998; hinde 2005; parker 2005;  and  reilly  1997)  argue  strongly  that  teachers must develop a more integrated curriculum.",3,mtms2007-05-497a,,
"The  deadening  effect  the  separate-subject  approach has  on  the  lives  of  young  people  cannot  be  overestimated. (Beane 2000, p. 229)",4,mtms2007-05-497a,,
"Sample Callout teachers want students to have meaningful educational experiences, rather than disconnected factual learning, they must push for curriculum integration. like Beane, we are concerned that when students leave our classrooms, they see no connections between the subjects and anything else in  their  other  classes  or  their  daily  lives.  Most  students assume that mathematics is for math class, art is for art class, and english is for english class, and  eDel reilly, e.reilly@iup.edu, teaches eighthgrade mathematics at Westmont Hilltop Middle School in Johnstown, PA 15905.

PhotograPh by Kenneth Sherwood; all rightS reServed energized  by  all  these  scholarly  arguments,  we decided  to  undertake  our  own  curricular  integration project. Our central goal in developing the high M.a.r.C.s. project, to integrate mathematics, art, research, collaboration, and storytelling, was to help students contextualize their learning. in this article, we describe the project in detail, discuss sample student work, and discuss how the project was evaluated.",5,mtms2007-05-497a,,
An Overview of the High M.A.R.C.S. Project,6,mtms2007-05-497a,,
"We  COnDuCteD  the  high  M.a.r.C.s.  prOjeCt with  three  mathematics  classes  over  a  one-month period. the school has full inclusion, so each class has students who cover the full range of mathematics abilities. in these classes, roughly 10 percent of the students  were  identified  as  gifted,  25  percent  were identified as students needing learning support, and the majority of students were at grade level, with the most common mathematics student grade being a B.",7,mtms2007-05-497a,,
"vOl. 12, nO. 9  .  May 2007   497 the  high  M.a.r.C.s. project was codesigned  by  two teachers,  edel reilly,  a  mathematics  teacher, and gian pagnucci, an english  professor.  Middle  school  students  involved in the project were asked to collaboratively write and illustrate  mathematics  storybooks.  as  they  worked on these projects, the students gradually came to see that concepts in mathematics could be connected to other aspects of both school and daily life.",8,mtms2007-05-497a,,
"We were interested in curriculum integration, however, with more and more standardized tests pushing every subject into its allotted time slot, there did not seem to be much we could do about the issue on a practical level. But then someone happened to give reilly a wonderful children’s book called Sir  Cumference  and  the  First  Round  Table  (neuschwander 1997). in this book, a knight has to use mathematics to solve several legendary challenges. the book gave  us  a  concrete  idea  for  showing  students  how mathematics could be linked to other disciplines.",9,mtms2007-05-497a,,
"We decided to ask reilly’s eighth-grade mathematics students to write their own children’s mathematical stories, much like the tale of Sir Cumference. We hoped this would help the students grasp how mathematical  knowledge  can  be  linked  to  other  areas. students normally are asked to develop their understandings of mathematics concepts by solving problems, but this approach keeps learning isolated. By writing stories about mathematics concepts, students would have to find a way to frame their understandings of the concepts. that is, they would have to tell a story that showed they understood the mathematical idea. they would also have to link that idea to the story’s plot, thereby demonstrating how mathematical knowledge is related to life situations.  after  several  weeks  of  planning  sessions,  we settled  on  three  subjects  that  we  felt  this  storywriting  project  could  integrate:  mathematics,  art, and english. the project would require students to write a story that contained a mathematics concept they had studied in class. the students would also have to illustrate their story to help readers better understand the mathematical ideas. We also would require  the  students  to  complete  research  for  the stories, a task that certainly crosses the disciplines. finally, since we were interested in breaking down problems of isolation of topics, we decided that we would  also  try  to  break  down  the  isolation  of  our students  by  asking  them  to  write  their  mathematics stories in teams. too often, students are asked to solve problems alone, although in the real world, most big problems are tackled through teamwork.

"Dekker  and  elshout-Mohr  (1998),  among  others, discuss the importance of having mathematics students  work  collaboratively.  By  the  time  we  had  a fully developed plan, we decided to call our idea the high  M.a.r.C.s.  project,  because  students  could earn  high  marks  (grades)  if  they  successfully  integrated mathematics, art, research, collaboration, and storytelling.",11,mtms2007-05-497a,,
Project Design,12,mtms2007-05-497a,,
"We  DesigneD  high  M.a.r.C.s.  as  a  fOur-Week project. it was introduced through a full day of reading  and  discussion  of  mathematics  storybooks,  followed  by  a  weeklong  out-of-class  research  project and another full day of discussion. in addition, three weeks were used for writing, illustrating, and editing the mathematics stories. During these three weeks, however, shorter time segments were used so that students could also spend time on other parts of the curriculum. roughly three times per week, each team was given fifteen minutes to work on their project at the  end  of  a  forty-two-minute  regular  mathematics class. in the final week of the project, one day was used for a trip to the school computer lab to work on publishing the stories, and two other days were used for having each team present its story to the class. students were expected to work on the project outside of class, but our own experience with collaborative projects had taught us that they do not succeed without regular in-class work time. in the rest of this section, we briefly explain some of the key phases of the project.",13,mtms2007-05-497a,,
"reilly  began  the  high  M.a.r.C.s.  project  by asking students to read several fictional children’s stories that contained mathematical problems from everyday life. these included the tale of Sir Cumference as well as the following books, to mention only a few: Alice in Pastaland: A Math Adventure (Wright 1997), Cut Down to Size at High Noon: A Math Adventure (sundby 2000), Dealing with Addition (long 1998), The King’s Chessboard (Birch 1988), Lemonade  for  Sale  (Murphy  1998),  and  Math  Curse  (scieszka and smith 1995).",14,mtms2007-05-497a,,
"after  they  reviewed  these  sample  books,  reilly then told the students that they were going to write their own children’s mathematics stories. One of the great  things  about  middle  school  students  is  they still  understand  that  learning  can  be  fun.  the  students were told that they would indeed be writing and illustrating their own children’s storybooks. But reilly also emphasized that each story was required to include a mathematics concept that had already been explored. she explained that one goal of the project was to see how well students understood the mathematics concept they chose for their story.",15,mtms2007-05-497a,,
Studying Mathematics in Everyday Life,16,mtms2007-05-497a,,
"OnCe  stuDents  unDerstOOD  that  the  project’s basic goal was to write a mathematical story, reilly explained the secondary goal: the story-writing task was meant to help students learn how mathematics  fits  into  everyday  life.  to  guide  students  toward this goal, reilly assigned a research grid. for the first week of the project, each student was asked to record on a chart all the uses of mathematics encountered in daily life. students were limited to one example per day from school, and they were not permitted to use any examples from their mathematics class. they could include as many examples as they wanted from outside school.  these  guidelines  were  meant  to  encourage the students to find mathematics being used in a wide range of situations.",17,mtms2007-05-497a,,
"this short research project led to a lively discussion, with some surprising findings. at the end of the week, each student brought a research grid to class for  discussion.  the  students  broke  into  their  project teams and compared their grids. the most common  mathematical  task  turned  out  to  be  calculating grades. students found many uses of statistics related to  sports,  especially  football  players’  performances. What students found most surprising was how many of their parents talked about mathematics: the value of money, family finances, and work-related salary issues. it prompted several students to talk to their parents and other adults about how mathematics was used on the job. these students learned that many adults used mathematics for calculating budgets, comparing sales results, and constructing homes.",18,mtms2007-05-497a,,
students  were  surprised  to  find  mathematical  ideas  in  the  movies  and  television  shows  they watched. they heard statistics about the spread of aiDs  and  a  news  report  about  the  federal  budget deficit. One student said he had watched a financial program  with  his  father  and  was  pleased  that  he could follow some of the mathematical ideas.,19,mtms2007-05-497a,,
"the  most  effective  part  of  the  entire  discussion was that all the students had begun to see mathematical concepts as critical for engaging with the world outside of school. several students even said they felt mathematics was more important than they had ever thought, based on the data they collected. Of course, not every student was excited by the research, but students  did  uniformly  report  a  new  awareness  of mathematics in the world around them.",20,mtms2007-05-497a,,
"Completing the Project in  Week  tWO  Of  the  prOjeCt,  the  stuDents used their research grids to brainstorm mathematical  concepts  they  could  use  to  write  their  stories. each team then picked a key mathematics concept  around which they would build the plot. the teams were  required  to  write  and  illustrate  the  story  together  and  explain  the  mathematics  concept  fully and accurately so that readers could grasp the mathematical concept’s importance.",21,mtms2007-05-497a,,
"in  week  two  of  the  project,  students  used  their class work time to outline their stories, write drafts of  each  section,  and  get  feedback  on  their  stories from reilly. students also spent class time illustrating  their  stories.  some  teams  drew  their  own  pictures for the stories while other teams searched for suitable computer clip art.",22,mtms2007-05-497a,,
"During the third week of the project, the student teams traded drafts with one another, then offered suggestions and comments about the stories, which helped  the  teams  to  make  revisions.  in  the  final week of the project, the student teams were given a full class day in the computer lab to assemble and print their story materials. they also used this day to create covers for their books and to add typical publishing  elements  like  page  numbers,  dedications, and author biographies.",23,mtms2007-05-497a,,
"the  highlight  of  the  project  was  the  final  day when  each  team  read  its  story  to  the  class  and passed around the books. there was plenty of applause and laughter, and several students asked for permission to print extra copies of the books to take home to share.",24,mtms2007-05-497a,,
"Samples of Students’ Mathematics Stories althOugh  We  WOulD  like  tO  share  all  the students’ mathematics stories, we only have space to briefly discuss a few representative samples.  in Math Short Stories, one team wrote a series of stories about the life and times of a group of middleschool-age students. these fictional characters did the types of things most middle schoolers do in their spare time: hang out with friends, shop at the mall, and order pizza. in the stories, the characters had to calculate a variety of discounts before making their purchases:",25,mtms2007-05-497a,,
"One dismal sunday afternoon, nancy and her mom went shopping at the mall. While they were there, nancy was feeling  a  little  depressed  because  her  boyfriend  just dumped her. so her mom said she could buy whatever she wanted as long as it was only $100 or less. so nancy went to the gap for her first stop. she bought a shirt that was originally $28.99 but was on sale at 15% off. then she went to  pacific  sunwear  and  bought  a  jacket  originally  $79.00 at  25%  off.  finally  at  Bloomingdale’s  she  found  two  cute pairs of shoes. the red pair was $19.99 and marked 10% off. the brown pair was even nicer, but it cost $24.00 and was marked 5% off. Did nancy have enough money left to buy either pair of shoes and finally forget about her lousy boyfriend? Or would she have to head to the food court to make herself feel better? vOl. 12, nO. 9  .  May 2007   499 since  many  student  teams  wrote  stories  involving abstract mathematical concepts, the students would often write several pages of text and then include a separate illustration that gave a feel for the characters in the story. the illustration from Math Short Stories (see fig. 1) shows what happens when nancy realizes she cannot afford to buy the new shoes and instead starts buying junk food and also offers advice about the consequences of unhealthy eating. Other stories  wove  text  and  art  together,  so  there  were many scenes of characters thinking, taking measurements, and reading numerical figures. the examples illustrate how students used art to enhance both their stories and the exploration of mathematical ideas.",26,mtms2007-05-497a,,
"in the story Jimmy’s Day with the Ogres (A Book about Math), middle schooler jimmy is kidnapped by three ogres who plan to eat him for dinner. to save  himself,  jimmy  must  help  the  ogres  clean up  their  messy  house.  (see  the  illustration  in  fig. 2.) to fix up the place, however, he has to use his knowledge of mathematics, specifically, how to calculate volume: “the next thing we need to do is store all your stuff. the way we do this is to calculate how big a box to make, and then we’ll put the stuff into it,” said jimmy.",27,mtms2007-05-497a,,

Evaluating the Project,40,mtms2007-05-497a,,
"We  evaluateD  these  stuDent  prOjeCts  using a variety of criteria. the most important criterion was how accurately the mathematical principles were discussed in the story. students were judged on  the  complexity  of  the  mathematical  concepts they wrote about as well as their knowledge of those concepts. although some student teams discussed fairly basic mathematics, most succeeded in weaving grade-appropriate mathematical ideas into their stories. for instance, in the story Math Daze, a student named Casey learned about the commutative property as she tried to calculate her grade in a class (see the illustration in fig. 3):",41,mtms2007-05-497a,,
"Casey had two grades, 24 and 13. if she added 24 and 13, she would get the total points. if she added 13 and 24, she would still get the total points. she realized she had been using the commutative property of addition: a + b = b + a. no matter how she added the points, she knew she had a lot of explaining to do to her mother!  in later semesters when we repeated the project, we learned it was useful to keep reminding the student teams  that  their  stories  should  use  mathematics concepts that had been discussed in class.",42,mtms2007-05-497a,,
"students were also judged on the quality of their writing  in  general;  the  books  were  evaluated  for how engaging their stories were as well as for accurate  use  of  grammar  and  punctuation.  finally, students were judged on their collaborative work. each student was asked to write a short reflective piece discussing how well the team had worked together, problems encountered, and individual contributions  to  the  team’s  success.  One  other  measure we used to judge effective collaboration was the  cohesiveness  of  each  book:  good  books  had tightly woven plots, whereas poor books read like individual  papers stapled together.",43,mtms2007-05-497a,,
"not  ever y aspect  of  the project  was a  success. some stories we received  used overly simple mathematics concepts,  like addition  and ",44,mtms2007-05-497a,,

"One last bit of evidence that the project was a success occurred when the classes were reviewing for their state tests. as reilly reviewed key concepts, several students recalled examples they had read in the class stories. everyone recalled jimmy and the ogres, for example, when reviewing volume. this convinced us that the high M.a.r.C.s. project was successful enough to merit more investigation in the future.",47,mtms2007-05-497a,,
