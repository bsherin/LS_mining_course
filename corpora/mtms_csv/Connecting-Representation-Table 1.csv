0,"Connecting Representations_ Using Predict, Check, Explain - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Although educators agree that making connections with the real world, as advocated by Principles to Actions: Ensuring Mathematical Success for All (NCTM 2014), is important, making such connections while addressing important mathematics is elusive. We have found, however, that math content coupled with the instructional strategy of predict, check, explain can bridge such real-world contexts. In so doing, this procedure supports the research-informed teaching practices of using evidence of student thinking and aiding meaningful mathematical discussion.",,
1,"Connecting Representations_ Using Predict, Check, Explain - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","In contrast to the common symbols-first approach, in which students manipulate symbols and memorize the mathematics, we have found that allowing students to investigate motion phenomena through the use of technology-based representations can foster students deep understanding of mathematics (Vahey et al. 2013; Vahey, Roy, and Fueyo 2013). As an example, we describe a high-cognitive-demand task (Stein and Smith 1998) that connects a real-world context with mathematics while supporting seventh-grade students understanding of rate and proportionality.",,
2,"Connecting Representations_ Using Predict, Check, Explain - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics",THE TASK,,
3,"Connecting Representations_ Using Predict, Check, Explain - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","The task is part of a learning module (SRI International 2009) in which seventh-grade students develop an understanding of rate and proportionality. Initial tasks ask students to investigate proportional relationships using software that connects graphs of time and position to a simulation of real-world motion. As the students progress through the module, they explore connections among such representations as tables, algebraic expressions, and narratives. All the representations are unified through investigations of the proportional relationship y = kx.",,
4,"Connecting Representations_ Using Predict, Check, Explain - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","A fundamental instructional strategy in the module is predict, check, explain (PCE), in which students make predictions based on the simulation and features of the mathematical representations, check their predictions, and explain similarities and differences between their predictions and results in the software. To illustrate how PCE supports the teaching practices that NCTM (2014) promotes, we will describe how a seventh-grade teacher and her students discuss their conceptions of a sprint (see fig. 1). The graph created in SimCalc MathWorlds (UMass Dartmouth 2015) represents how long it took Jace to run a race, shown both graphically and through an animated simulation of the motion. We highlight this pivotal task because it challenges students to go beyond calculating speed and explore proportional relationships using not only graphs and animations but also the representations of a table and an equation. Together these representations provide an encompassing image that a singular representation cannot provide (Tripathi 2008).",,

7,"Connecting Representations_ Using Predict, Check, Explain - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Before the whole-class discussions, the teacher asked students to explore the task individually or in small groups. This allowed students to explore their intuitive conceptions of the task before the whole-class discussion. It also created the need to make those individual or small-group conceptions public so that the teacher and class could discuss and evaluate them together. For example, students worked in small groups using the software to determine how long it would take Jace to run 25 meters and 50 meters. The teacher then prompted the students to use the graph (see fig. 1) to predict how long it would take Jace to run 100 meters if he continued to run at the same speed.",,
8,"Connecting Representations_ Using Predict, Check, Explain - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics",Teacher: Does anybody have a prediction?,,
9,"Connecting Representations_ Using Predict, Check, Explain - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics",Chelsey: 12.,,
10,"Connecting Representations_ Using Predict, Check, Explain - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics",Teacher: Did anybody else have 12? Anything else?,,
11,"Connecting Representations_ Using Predict, Check, Explain - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics",Jackson: 16.,,
12,"Connecting Representations_ Using Predict, Check, Explain - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Teacher: And we have a debate. Dont we love a debate? What do you think, Connor? The question was if Jace keeps running at the same rate, how long will it take Jace to run 100 meters?",,
13,"Connecting Representations_ Using Predict, Check, Explain - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","As the conversation continued, the students were urged to make a second prediction. This time, they were prompted to use the table (see fig. 2) to predict how far Jace would run in 15 seconds and 30 seconds, respectively, if he continued to run at the same speed.",,
14,"Connecting Representations_ Using Predict, Check, Explain - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics",,,
15,"Connecting Representations_ Using Predict, Check, Explain - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Teacher: When youre done with that, fill in the third and fourth rows of your table [see fig. 2], and then we have another prediction. Whats the next prediction? Drew?",,
16,"Connecting Representations_ Using Predict, Check, Explain - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Drew: Fifteen seconds, 30 seconds.",,
17,"Connecting Representations_ Using Predict, Check, Explain - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics",Teacher: So how did you come to that prediction?,,
18,"Connecting Representations_ Using Predict, Check, Explain - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","This dialogue had several important features. First, by concentrating on students predictions, the teacher was able to encourage them to make their intuitive mathematical ideas public. At this point, the teacher did not respond to the correctness of the predictions; instead, she took differences in predictions as an opportunity to discuss the task. This purposeful choice helped to create a mathematical environment in which students could engage in meaningful discourse to build shared understanding of mathematical ideas being explored (NCTM 2014). The teachers decision was also important because public conjectures allowed students to build on the thinking of others (Knudsen et al. 2014).",,
19,"Connecting Representations_ Using Predict, Check, Explain - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","It is also worth noting that students were challenged to make predictions about the relationship using two different representations. They were asked first to predict the time given the distance using the graph, and second to predict the distance given the time using the table. As a result, the students had to mathematically link the graphical and tabular representations.",,
20,"Connecting Representations_ Using Predict, Check, Explain - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","The predictions allowed the teacher to observe the practice of eliciting and using evidence of student thinking (NCTM 2014). The attention given to predictions permitted the teacher to assess what the students noticed in the graph and table as a way to interpret the sprint. Moreover, it allowed the teacher to move the mathematics agenda forward by preparing students to participate in the check phase, the second step in the strategy.",,
21,"Connecting Representations_ Using Predict, Check, Explain - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics",Check,,
22,"Connecting Representations_ Using Predict, Check, Explain - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","After the predictions were made public, students checked them using the software, thus challenging students to make sense of both their correct and incorrect lines of reasoning as well as that of their peers. In this way, technology became a tool to assist students in understanding the mathematical relationship they were exploring. For instance, after working in pairs, the teacher noted one students strategic use of technology (CCSSI 2010), showing how long it would take Jace to run 100 meters if he continued to run at the same speed.",,
23,"Connecting Representations_ Using Predict, Check, Explain - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Teacher: Who stretched their graph to see if their prediction was accurate? Lindsay, show us what you did.",,
24,"Connecting Representations_ Using Predict, Check, Explain - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Lindsay: I started with this at 100 [student moved end of line to point (16, 100); (see fig. 1)] . . . then I moved the time all the way to 32 and then I was looking to see if it went up to 200 [see fig. 3].",,
25,"Connecting Representations_ Using Predict, Check, Explain - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics",,,
26,"Connecting Representations_ Using Predict, Check, Explain - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","By making this students stretching of the line public, the teacher gave students a visual link that connected the graph and table. In addition, the link meant that the teacher could point out the quantitative aspects of the relationship to the whole class.",,
27,"Connecting Representations_ Using Predict, Check, Explain - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics",Teacher: How would we find Jaces speed?,,
28,"Connecting Representations_ Using Predict, Check, Explain - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics",Quinn: We would take the distance in meters and divide it by time.,,
29,"Connecting Representations_ Using Predict, Check, Explain - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics",Teacher: Distance over time; everybody agrees with that [teacher posted students reasoning on the interactive white board]. He [Quinn] took 25 divided by 4. Did everybody take 25 divided by 4?,,
30,"Connecting Representations_ Using Predict, Check, Explain - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","As the conversation continued, Quinns mathematical conjecture, that Jaces speed was 25 meters  4 seconds = 6.25 m/s, provided an opportunity to return to predictions of distances made earlier in the conversation.",,
31,"Connecting Representations_ Using Predict, Check, Explain - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics",Student: I did 200 divided by 32.,,
32,"Connecting Representations_ Using Predict, Check, Explain - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics",Student: I did 100 divided by 16.,,

34,"Connecting Representations_ Using Predict, Check, Explain - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics",Student: The table.,,
35,"Connecting Representations_ Using Predict, Check, Explain - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Teacher: The table is one. Where else were we looking for our distances? On your line. Was there a precise distance on that line that we could say was definitely that distance at a certain time? What about the end point? The 100, the 200? You can pull from the table, you can pull from your visual [graph], and it really doesnt matter which one you choose. All of you are going to come to the same what?",,
36,"Connecting Representations_ Using Predict, Check, Explain - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics",Students: Speed.,,
37,"Connecting Representations_ Using Predict, Check, Explain - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","The dialogue up to this point was noteworthy because it allowed the teacher to ensure that all the students in the class were exposed to the important mathematical connections that only some students had in their smaller groups. Furthermore, the dialogue allowed the teacher to bring gaps in students understanding to the surface as she began to move the class toward the underlying mathematical reasoning explored in explain, the final phase of the instructional strategy.",,
38,"Connecting Representations_ Using Predict, Check, Explain - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics",Explain,,
39,"Connecting Representations_ Using Predict, Check, Explain - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","The last phase involved engaging students in explaining the mathematical differences between their predictions and what the software showed. When done well, explanations can serve as a way to connect various mathematical representations and in turn deepen students understanding. For example, the teacher engaged the students after they worked individually on the final part of the task.",,
40,"Connecting Representations_ Using Predict, Check, Explain - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics",Teacher: Explain connections between patterns in the table and the formula that you wrote [in small groups]. Lets piggyback off where Jacob just was. Now lets describe connections between the patterns that we see in the table and the formula that you wrote.,,

43,"Connecting Representations_ Using Predict, Check, Explain - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics",Sophia: The formula is distance is 6.25t.,,
44,"Connecting Representations_ Using Predict, Check, Explain - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","In the end, the instructional routine of PCE allowed the teacher to bring her students intuitions to the surface using a position time graph before providing them with the formal quantitative relationship d = rt. Further, the shared reasoning granted the teacher and students opportunities to develop mathematical links among graphs, tables, equations, and verbal descriptions. These links also provided a foundation that will serve students well as they study rate, proportionality, and slope.",,

49,"Connecting Representations_ Using Predict, Check, Explain - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","In Principles to Actions, mathematics teachers are encouraged to use high-cognitive-demand tasks that require students to explore key concepts in real-world contexts. When such tasks and contexts are combined, teachers and students employ an alternative to a symbols-first approach. Rather than requiring students to manipulate symbols, we suggest that teachers use a graph as the driving representation to allow students to predict a mathematical situation. The predictions then can be checked using technology (e.g., SimCalc MathWorlds, TI-Navigator). The juxtaposition of a prediction and a check allows a teacher to make students reasoning public and as a result allows them to spend a majority of a discussion to use research-informed teaching practices like the ones outlined in Principles to Actions (NCTM 2014) while guiding students toward a deeper explanation of the mathematics.",,
