"Concrete Computational Strategies for Dividing Fractions Christopher M. Kribs-Zaleta oOranges, posters, ribbons, and lemonade in a mathematics classroom sound like recipe ingredients for a class party. Instead, they were used as story- problem contexts and concrete models to help students develop computational strategies for dividing fractions. ",3,mtms2008-04-453a,,
"The topic of division of fractions  is so universally associated with a single, hard-to-explain algorithm in U.S. classrooms that many teach- christopher Kribs-Zaleta, kribs@uta.edu, teaches at the University of Texas at Arlington, in Arlington, TX 76019. His interests  include the development of (measurement) unit concepts in K–8 mathematics, as well as mathematical epidemiology and ecology. The author gratefully acknowledges several helpful conversations with Nancy Mack in framing this project.",4,mtms2008-04-453a,,
"ers, when describing how they see it taught, laughingly cite the old rhyme, “Ours not to reason why, just invert and multiply!” A colleague and I set out to walk a path toward meaningful understanding of this operation. ",5,mtms2008-04-453a,,

"Mathematics suggests building on student knowledge of division of whole numbers so that students can develop a meaningful understanding  of division of fractions (NCTM 2000, p. 219). Research by Ambrose, Baek, and Carpenter (2003) and others has shown that students who are working with whole numbers develop distinct computational strategies for different kinds of problems. For example, when making as many groups as possible when the group size is known, measurement division, often represented symbolically as repeated subtraction, is used; when dealing items out one or a few at a time and when splitting items among a given number of groups, partitive division, also called fair sharing, is used. We were interested in seeing whether these distinctions would persist when the numbers involved were fractions. To look at students’ initial experiences with this topic and since most of the literature on learning division of fractions describes students working at a purely pictorial or symbolic level, we used story problems grounded in contexts that allow students to construct concrete models.",7,mtms2008-04-453a,,
"Most division of fractions story  problems used in textbooks and research studies use only measurement division problems (for a notable exception, see Ott, Snook, and Gibson 1991), perhaps because it is difficult to write a story problem involving sharing among a fractional number of groups. However, the notion of a fraction as a quotient typically draws from a partitive notion of division. For this reason, we wrote problems in pairs, grounding one measurement and one partitive problem in the same context. Figure 1 shows four pairs of division problems, marked M for measurement and P for partitive. Question 5, for example, is a measurement division problem similar to ones that appear in Principles and Standards (NCTM 2000, p. 219) and research studies (Sharp and Adams 2002). We have not seen partitive problems like question 6 in use, which require a different kind of thinking to find a solution (prior to using a generalized algorithm).",8,mtms2008-04-453a,,

"We worked at a local Title I school with sixth graders who had no prior formal introduction to division of fractions. We provided materials for making concrete models, as well as plenty of paper for recording work and drawing pictorial models. We also answered students’ questions (often with questions of our own) while they worked. The only formal direction given was that students could use any methods that they could explain. At no time did we mention that these problems involved division of fractions, because we wanted to see what sense the students would make of them. Most students worked in small groups, making concrete models to solve the problems. We were excited to see two different types of strategies emerge, one for each problem type, each one drawing from common invented strategies for division with whole numbers. For measurement division problems such as that in question 1, most solutions involved a two-step process: 1.  Subdivide everything into units of the given denominator (e.g., fourths).",11,mtms2008-04-453a,,
"2.  Group the new pieces according to  the numerator (e.g., three).",12,mtms2008-04-453a,,
The second step is a classic measurement-division-of-whole-numbers strategy; the first step is needed to deal with the denominator that is now part of the divisor. Figures 2 and 3 illustrate solutions of this type for question 1.,13,mtms2008-04-453a,,
"Some groups, however, used a  one-step procedure to solve question 1, making as many 3/4 oranges as possible with a minimum of cuts (see fig. 4). This was possible because 3/4 is a recognizable quantity and easily modeled. With question 3’s divisor of 2/3, everyone divided sheets into thirds first, then grouped by twos.",14,mtms2008-04-453a,,
"Solutions to the partitive problems  also tended to involve two steps, but here the order was reversed from that  given in the earlier examples: 1.  Partition the dividend into as many groups as the numerator (e.g., three).",15,mtms2008-04-453a,,
"2.  Build as many of the groups created above as the denominator (e.g., five).",16,mtms2008-04-453a,,
"The first step is a classic dealing-out  strategy for partitive division of whole numbers, and the second step is added to adjust the “units” from those of the denominator (e.g., from fifths of a serving to servings). The student work for question 2 is shown in figure 2.",17,mtms2008-04-453a,,
"This two-step solution was used universally for question 2, in which the divisor is less than 1. However, ",18,mtms2008-04-453a,,

"Fig. 5 students discuss the remainder in question 5 (in this model, 1 inch of ribbon represents 1 foot).",22,mtms2008-04-453a,,
"with question 4’s divisor of 2 1/3, we found that most groups attempted instead a one-step approach based on the dealing out used in partitive division of whole numbers: They dealt out sheets or half sheets of paper into two stacks, reserving some for the 1/3 pile, then checked to see if what was held in reserve was actually 1/3 of what was in each of the full piles.",23,mtms2008-04-453a,,
"We also observed some common  errors as the students worked on the problems. The error that stood out most involved remainders in the measurement division problems. Students would often complete the division using the concrete model and correctly report the number of complete groups made but then report the remainder in terms of the original units. For example, in question 1 (see again figs. 2 and 3), many students  initially reported the answer as 3 1/4 and moved on; only after we asked for the units did students realize that they had 3 servings and 1/4 of an orange. A further conversation was needed to figure out how much of a serving that last 1/4 orange represented. A similar confusion arose for one group in discussing question 5; students considered the remainder, pictured in figure 5 as 3/4 (feet of ribbon), until they were asked for the units.",24,mtms2008-04-453a,,
"Interestingly, this issue never arose  in the partitive problems, perhaps because remainders manifest concretely in a very different way (repeatedly, as part of each group). Instead, sometimes students erred by mistaking the type of division involved: for instance, dividing the oranges into fifths for question 2 before realizing that this process did not help them answer the question.  (We did not get to follow up with the tempting question of why the answer they would get by completing the measurement division was the same as the answer they eventually found through using a correct partitive model.)",25,mtms2008-04-453a,,
"Finally, the other misstep we saw students make in measurement problems was to subdivide the fractional part of the dividend into as many parts (rather than the same-sized parts) as they had divided the whole-number part. In question 1, quartering the half orange into eighths was common (one group even went back and halved all the other quarter oranges before realizing the error). In any case, though, these last two errors were typically selfcorrected by the group when trying to make sense of the problem.",26,mtms2008-04-453a,,
conclusions,27,mtms2008-04-453a,,
"This activity was just the beginning  of the learning process for these students beginning to divide fractions and mixed numbers. Although they clearly came to class with some welldeveloped notions about division and representing fractions, the concrete models they made to solve problems shaped their approaches in new ways and helped them identify and correct some errors themselves. At this point, they were ready for problems involving more complicated quantities, which would eventually encourage them to move to more abstract strategies: using pictures and then symbolic computation. Sharp and Adams (2002) identified the removal of context and the inclusion of remainders as two key elements in developing more generalized procedures (but note that all their contextual problems involved measurement division). Some educators have suggested that meaningful development of computational fluency for division of fractions may lead for some to a common-denominator approach (see, for instance, the second approaches developed in Flores, ",28,mtms2008-04-453a,,
"Turner, and Bachman 2003 and Perlwitz 2004),  rather than a straight invert-and-multiply approach.",29,mtms2008-04-453a,,
"Teachers should keep in mind several considerations illustrated by this activity when planning their own students’ work with division of fractions. It is important to give students the opportunity to develop concrete models in their first experiences with these problems and to provide a balance of measurement and partitive division problems. The partitive interpretation of division, which is often invoked in interpreting fractions, casts remainders in a different light, which are then more likely to be reported correctly. Teachers may also want to choose initial problems that allow one-step division of whole numbers procedures to be carried over (by using simple, familiar divisors in measurement problems, or using divisors greater than 1 or 2 in partitive problems) before presenting students with problems  whose complexity requires a two-step solution. Specific problem contexts are also important. Oranges and sheets of paper, for example, provide a recognizable whole (as compared with ribbon and lemonade), and lemonade can be un-divided or re-divided, leaving no trace of earlier divisions, whereas cuts made on oranges, paper, and ribbon are permanent. All these issues can prove to be important steps down the road at the end of which measurement and partitive problems become one: simply division.",30,mtms2008-04-453a,,
