The solution methods that students employed to solve this problem involved both symmetry and guess and check. The methods also opened up windows of understanding for them.,3,mtms2009-09-74a,,

Window Panes,7,mtms2009-09-74a,,
"Diana designs stained-glass windows. She has a large supply of square glass window panes. Some panes are yellow, and some panes are red. She wants to place them in windows like the one below in such a way that no two windows are the same, even when the design is rotated or reflected. How many different window designs can she create using any combination of red and yellow panes?",8,mtms2009-09-74a,,
Example: The following window designs would be considered the same and counted as one design.,9,mtms2009-09-74a,,
"This department shares creative solutions to the problems in “Solve It!” articles, which appear a few times a year in MTMS. Classroom teachers can send their students’ work along with sufficient information to follow their students’ thinking. Send manuscripts to edward s. Mooney, Illinois State University, Campus Box 4520, Normal, IL 617904520, or by e-mail to mooney@ilstu.edu. Published solutions will be credited. ",10,mtms2009-09-74a,,
Fig. 2 Other students used colored paper to simulate glass window panes to create and categorize possible designs.  designs for the window panes. Some students tried a guess-and-check approach. Others tried to be more systematic in listing or drawing the designs (see fig. 1 for sample work). Other students worked with paper to simulate window color to determine the 24 unique designs (see fig. 2).,11,mtms2009-09-74a,,
"Some students recognized the  symmetry that can be found. Michele (see fig. 3) explained that the number of designs for 2 red and 4 yellow panes will be the same as the number of designs for 4 red and 2 yellow panes. Therefore, it was unnecessary to draw those windows. The same held true for the number of designs using 1 red and 5 yellow panes and 5 red and 1 yellow pane.",12,mtms2009-09-74a,,
Pane-less eXtensions Adding more panes is just one way that this task can be extended. ,13,mtms2009-09-74a,,
Karen Perna asked her students to work on two different extensions. The first extension involved looking at the different designs that could be created with red and yellow panes if the original window had 8 panes instead of 6. They found 68 unique designs (see fig. 4). ,14,mtms2009-09-74a,,
"The second extension Perna’s  students worked on was finding the different designs that could be created if Diana could work with red, yellow, and blue panes. They found 216 distinct designs (see fig. 5). ",15,mtms2009-09-74a,,

Fig. 5 The number of design possibilities increased greatly when using 6 panes and 3 colors of glass. These designs are just a few of the 216 that students found.,20,mtms2009-09-74a,,
