"Many people see mathematics differently than I do. This realization coincided with my decision to become a math teacher. To me, mathematics was a fascinating array of logical processes and connections; to others, it was nothing more than meaningless memorization or guesswork that left them frustrated and demoralized. People often reflect on their mathematics experiences by saying, “I never liked math” or “I never got math.” Traditional practices of teaching are painting an image of the subject that does not reveal its purposes or potential. ",5,mtms2011-09-88a,,
"After receiving my teaching   license, I was anxious to begin cultivating my mathematical environ- on complex mathematical tasks that engaged them in problem solving and making and evaluating conjectures, much like the image painted by NCTM’s vision (2000). I assumed that a committed teacher could easily implement these practices in the classroom. However, none of this happened automatically. Overcome with learning how to manage a classroom, navigating the constant time crunch, and working around the lack of support and resources for teaching math differently, I found myself neglecting my goals and adopting survival mode to deal with more pressing priorities, as many teachers have described (see, for example, Cady 2006). ",6,mtms2011-09-88a,,
"Rather than creating opportunities for my students to explore and refine conjectures, I was often positioned at the front of the room, demonstrating procedures while frantically trying to help students see the meaning behind the procedures that they applied to predictable exercises found in their textbook. Needless to say, participation in my classroom failed to challenge the widespread belief that doing mathematics means memorizing rules without understanding their meaning (Boaler 2000; Frank 1989). ",7,mtms2011-09-88a,,
"After surviving my first two years of  teaching, I decided to take small and manageable steps toward this overwhelming goal of my original vision. The environment I was attempting to  establish ran counter to both my years and my students’ years of sitting in a classroom. It caused me to question whether I was a good teacher, even though research suggests that these experiences are an integral part of the transitional process that every teacher must undergo when changing practices (Edwards 2000; Frykholm 2004). I hope that my story empowers others who are attempting similar endeavors.",8,mtms2011-09-88a,,
claRiFYing MY vision,9,mtms2011-09-88a,,
"To begin to make changes in my practice, I needed a clearer vision of those changes and was inspired by reading the work of Gaye Williams (2000, 2002a), another mathematics teacher who shifted her classroom practice from a teacher-centered to a studentcentered approach. Williams’s work offered some practical insights into how this change would appear. Her approach involved structuring an entire lesson around a complex and unfamiliar problem so that students learned new concepts as they developed solution strategies (Williams 2002a). I anticipated that this learning environment would help my students develop and refine their strategies, solve problems, and see the meaning behind the mathematics. Williams suggested that tasks should allow for multiple entry points and solution paths, and the mathematical content should push students to find a new procedural approach to a solution (Williams 2002b). In addition, NCTM (1991) made  recommendations for worthwhile mathematical tasks, suggesting that teachers should select items that “do not separate mathematical thinking from mathematical concepts or skills, that capture students’ curiosity, and that invite them to speculate and to pursue their hunches” (p. 25). Although these tasks often resembled word problems, they were clearly different from the oversimplified versions offered by textbooks.",10,mtms2011-09-88a,,
"My main source for tasks was Figure This! Math Challenges for Families (NCTM 2004). I selected as many tasks as would fit within the goals of my eighth-grade mathematics course. These goals were shaped by standards, department expectations, the textbook, and my own judgment about what mathematics was most worthwhile for my students.",11,mtms2011-09-88a,,
needing a neW stRUctURe,12,mtms2011-09-88a,,
The Launch-Explore-Summarize teaching model (Lappan et al. 1998) provided a way to structure how students participated in tasks. Shifting the structure of lessons helped me foster my desired environment. This approach to teaching was different for me in that it recommended giving students very little instruction before they began work on a mathematical task. ,13,mtms2011-09-88a,,
Launch,14,mtms2011-09-88a,,
"During the Launch, or the brief period of instruction at the beginning of the lesson, the teacher provided critical information, reviewed prerequisite knowledge, and then issued the challenge (see fig. 1). I had to be  careful not to give away any important mathematics that I wanted my students to explore. By allowing students to figure it out on their own, they felt ownership of the idea and, it was hoped, remembered it better. Before the Grape Juice task began, I had to ensure that my students understood the term concentrates, as in grape juice concentrates. Beyond that, I did not want to offer suggestions for any mathematical procedures so that students could make sense of the problem on their own and reason their way to the solution using their own methods. ",15,mtms2011-09-88a,,
Explore,16,mtms2011-09-88a,,
"The Explore phase occurred when students problem solved in groups to find their own solution to the task. When students collaborated, Brown and colleagues (1989) suggested, they were able to “synergize insights” that they could not have on their own. When one student made a suggestion that intrigued the group, the students could pursue it together.

"Source: Williams (2000)  ing, phase of the lesson began. The teacher held a class discussion in which each group shared its solutions, and class members asked questions. The teacher emphasized key mathematical ideas that were discussed and helped students come to consensus (Grant 2009). To streamline the reporting process, Williams (2002a) suggested asking each group to share one key idea that was new or different from that shared by another group. During this summary discussion, the job of the teacher was to ask questions that shed light on similarities and differences in solutions, that reached generalizations on which solution strategies were effective and efficient, and that brought out any potential misconceptions.  estaBlishing neW classRooM noRMs",39,mtms2011-09-88a,,
"After selecting tasks and beginning to use them in my classroom, I learned that simply implementing a new practice, such as the LaunchExplore-Summarize lesson structure, was not sufficient for establishing new ways of participating in mathematics. The environment I was attempting to establish ran counter to years of mathematics experiences of both my students and myself. Thus, it took time to model new ways of participating and to begin the process of renegotiating classroom norms  with the students, a process also recognized by others (Goos 2004; van Oers 2001).",40,mtms2011-09-88a,,
"My initial implementation of  tasks was met with complaints and difficulties as students were exposed to a different view of mathematics. Groups were initially unproductive, did not know where to begin, and were apprehensive about the perceived lack of guidance they were receiving. They expressed frustration about the open-ended nature of the task and the lack of direction I was providing when they made these comments: “I don’t get this”; “We haven’t learned how to do this yet”; and “What do we do?” When I would not comply with requests to show them what to do, they attempted more subtle efforts to obtain a hint.",41,mtms2011-09-88a,,
"As groups thought of an idea during the Explore phase, they flagged me down, shared their ideas, and searched my face for some evidence of an evaluation. I asked students to share their thinking, tried to serve as another sounding board for their ideas, praised their creativity, and persistently asked them to justify all their ideas. However, despite the fact that many students had experienced only limited success in previous mathematics classes, they were more comfortable with recognizable routines and looked to me to maintain them. ",42,mtms2011-09-88a,,
"In addition to the struggle caused  by my students’ discomfort as they experienced new ways of participating in mathematics, I experienced internal tension as well. Encouraging students to explore mathematics required letting go of some control of the class. “Will they come up with any meaningful ideas without my guidance?” This question seemed silly, having witnessed all that they could do. Juggling my own uncertainty, I attempted to send the message that this was just a typical day in my classroom and encouraged students by saying: •	 “You	may	not	have	done	math	this	 way before, but this is the way we do math in my classroom.”  •	 “I	know	I	haven’t	shown	you	how	to	 do this problem, but there is not just one right way to do it. I want you to discuss it in your group and come up with the best solution that you can.” ",43,mtms2011-09-88a,,
"I hoped that these comments convinced them to give it a try. Being lured by my students toward upholding a traditional role and pulled internally by my own lack of comfort with my new role, we struggled together with renegotiating a new mathematical culture. ",44,mtms2011-09-88a,,
"I tried to steer clear of the role of “knower of all things,” because I wanted my students to develop the confi dence and autonomy to fi nd their own solutions. Rather than affi rming their decisions, I listened, asked “Why?” to press for further reasoning and justifi cation, and explained, “I’m not trying to sway your decision; I’m just trying to understand how you made your decision.” It was challenging to respond to questions without directing them to a particular strategy that I might use.",45,mtms2011-09-88a,,
"Students often experienced dif- fi culty at the beginning of a task because they were not confi dent about trying a strategy without knowing the outcome. This required giving students affi rmative feedback about trying ideas, regardless of the immediate success, because they needed to learn how to think for themselves. If their initial strategy was unsuccessful, they typically realized the error themselves and refi ned the strategy.",46,mtms2011-09-88a,,

Using a vaRietY oF aPPRoaches The Grape Juice Task,50,mtms2011-09-88a,,
"One of the fi rst tasks implemented (see fi g. 1) was selected to promote the concept of proportionality, which should develop as students collaborated to solve the problem. I wanted students to fi nd their own strategies for comparing ratios that we could in turn develop as a class into more effi cient procedures. I added additional prompts to the original task, intending to move students’ thinking beyond the context of grape juice toward a mathematical representation and then toward a generalization of how to compare ratios. ",51,mtms2011-09-88a,,
"Groups approached this problem in various ways. Two groups did all their reasoning using the context of a grape juice recipe and a process of elimination, demonstrating a conceptual understanding of proportionality without employing traditional mathematical representations. Most groups eventually saw a connection to writing recipes as ratios and comparing them as fractions. One group drew representations they called fraction bars, likely drawing on past experiences comparing fractions.",52,mtms2011-09-88a,,
"Each group correctly selected the recipe with the strongest grape taste. Since this particular task had one correct answer, it was diffi cult to help them see value in justifying it. They were accustomed to a classroom norm in which the answer was the most important part or the only part needed to get full credit. I grappled with how to help them see that reasoning and justifi cation had as much value as fi nding the answer and found myself constantly emphasizing this in verbal and written feedback.",53,mtms2011-09-88a,,
"Despite an elaborate conversation  that one group had before making its decision, its written response to “Carefully explain how you made your choice” read only “Process of elimination.” Battles such as getting my students to value new things in mathematics class were ongoing. Another group, after agreeing to a solution, spent ample time deliberating how to express their thoughts as a “mathematical explanation.” They fi nally wrote their response as < .",54,mtms2011-09-88a,,
This group was not alone in thinking that the “mathematical” request implied numbers and symbols rather than words.,55,mtms2011-09-88a,,
"During the Summarize phase of this lesson, each group presented its solution methods. Their collective verbalized understanding drove the class discussion that involved comparing recipes and examining generalizations. Students were able to see which strategies were the most effi cient for comparing ratios. ",56,mtms2011-09-88a,,
"After each new task, I refl ected on the lesson, analyzed what areas needed to be emphasized to improve participation, and often concluded that I needed to encourage better justifi cation and explanation of solutions. One aspect of renegotiating classroom participation involved sending value signals, or suggestions, of the mathematical behaviors that were valued in my classroom. To send a value signal, I returned papers with follow-up questions or comments, subtracted points for lack of elaboration, and introduced tasks with verbal reminders:  •	 “I	am	not	grading	you	on	the	correctness of your answer but on your participation and how well you can justify your thinking.”  •	 “Make	sure	you	involve	everyone	 in your group when making decisions.” ",57,mtms2011-09-88a,,
The Statue of Liberty Task,58,mtms2011-09-88a,,
This task was also implemented:  ,59,mtms2011-09-88a,,
"This task was much more open-ended than the Grape Juice task and allowed for multiple possible solutions. Students initially suspected that I had accidently omitted critical information in the problem. I encouraged them to devise a strategy using the information they had. Eventually, they began to think about their own measurements and the potential for proportionality between one’s arm and nose. One prompt on their task sheet asked the following:  Describe in detail how you calculated the length of the Statue of Liberty’s nose. Describe the process in so much detail that other students could follow your method on their own.",60,mtms2011-09-88a,,
" The arm of the Statue of Liberty is 42 feet long. How long is her nose? (NCTM 2004, Task No. 61)",61,mtms2011-09-88a,,
"This was another example of encouraging students to elaborate when writing their solutions, both to help  them learn to communicate—and to help me understand—their thinking. On this particular task, students offered elaborate written descriptions about the steps they followed to solve the problem (as shown in fig. 3). ",62,mtms2011-09-88a,,
"Although the open-ended nature of the task gave the class more ownership over the solution, it was coupled with students’ growing more comfortable with the process of explaining their thinking and seeing their thinking as being valuable. Aware of various unit-discrepancy errors from the past, I was impressed to see that each group had resolved any discrepancies in units on their own by the end of the lesson. The extended time to explore a single task seemed to enhance students’ ability to make sense of the context and check for any inconsistencies. ",63,mtms2011-09-88a,,

The sense of pride that students showed in their work helped me realize that my efforts were not in vain. I was slowly renegotiating a new image of mathematics with students. My worries about students not reaching any conclusions were often unfounded. When it was time to share their fi ndings, every group had ideas to report. At times, clever strategies emerged that I had not anticipated. When groups presented different conclusions, the summary reporting and discussion time provided classmates with an opportunity to challenge the ideas and come to a shared understanding of the solution.
