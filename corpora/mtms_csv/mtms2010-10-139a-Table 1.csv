Kickin’ It with  “Integer Football”,2,mtms2010-10-139a,,
"Students often struggle with adding and subtracting integers. To help alleviate this struggle, I found a way to relate integers to a topic that is practically universal: football. I developed the game of “integer football” as a way for students to practice the skills of adding and subtracting integers and to show them how these concepts work outside the classroom.

"This game is played with a standard deck of cards. An ace is 1 yard, each number card is its face value in yards, and all face cards are 10 yards. Black cards have positive values, and red cards have negative values. You can opt to play with the jokers, which can represent fumbles: Each player will draw a card, and the higher value will “recover” the ball. The student who “fumbled” will draw from the passing pile, and the other player will draw from the running pile. ",7,mtms2010-10-139a,,

The Kickoff,20,mtms2010-10-139a,,
"To determine a starting point, or ﬁ rst down, the ﬁ rst player draws three cards; adds the values, regardless of color; and multiplies the sum by 3. (Unlike the real game of football, the player who “kicks off ” in “integer football” starts on offense.) This number is placed in position (a) in the calculation as shown in ﬁ gure 1. The remaining cards in the deck are divided into two piles: running and passing. ",21,mtms2010-10-139a,,
Making a Play,22,mtms2010-10-139a,,
"The player then draws one card from either the running pile or passing pile. The card’s value goes into positions (b) and (f ), representing the number of yards moved on this play. If the card is black, the player writes a positive value; if red, the player writes a negative value in the two blanks for the play. Calculate the new yard-line location, (c), and the number of yards necessary to complete 10 yards, (g). Position (d) keeps track of the player’s downs. Just as in real football, players have four tries, or downs, to gain 10 yards. If this is achieved, the player starts over with a ﬁ rst down for another 10 yards. Position (e) states how many yards are needed to get another ﬁ rst down. ",23,mtms2010-10-139a,,
The Next Play,24,mtms2010-10-139a,,
"The same player continues with his or her turn, and, once again, has four tries to make a second down. To start the second play, he or she picks another card and—  •  puts the value in (c) into (a); •  copies the value from (g) into (e); •  increases (d) by 1; and •  clears out (b), (c), (e), (f ).",25,mtms2010-10-139a,,
"After any play up to four, a negative value in position (g) indicates that the player got the 10 yards required for the down. At this point, the count in (d) starts over at 1 and (e) starts back at 10. Hence, ﬁ rst and 10.  an exaMple",26,mtms2010-10-139a,,
"To determine where I start, I draw three cards: a 10, 8, and 2. I multiply their sum (20) by 3 (60). My score sheet reads that I am at my 60-yard line, first down, with 10 yards to go (see fig. 2a). ",27,mtms2010-10-139a,,
I draw a black 7 from the running pile. Now I enter the 7 into positions (b) and (f ). I perform the calculations and place the answers in the appropriate positions (see fig. 2b).,28,mtms2010-10-139a,,
"My next entry will start on the 67yard line, second down, with 3 yards to go to get a first down (see fig. 2c). This time, I draw a black 5 (see  fig. 2d.) Since the number of yards left, (g), is negative, I have reached the required 10 yards and start my downs over on the next play. This means that my count of downs (d) resets to 1,  and my yards (e) is reset to 10 (see  fig. 2e).",29,mtms2010-10-139a,,
"I draw again, this time from the  passing pile. I draw a red 9. Since the card is red, I add a −9 to the 72 and subtract it from 10. Remember, since I got a first down, positions (d) and (e) were reset to first and 10. ",30,mtms2010-10-139a,,
Second Player’s Turn,31,mtms2010-10-139a,,
"Let’s assume that I have gone through all my downs without moving the required 10 yards, and it is time for a turnover. The second player must subtract my final yard line from 100 to establish his or her beginning yard line. For example, if the turnover occurred when I was on the 63-yard line, the second player would start at his or her 37-yard line. The player has gained possession of the ball at the 37-yard line; the goal is to get to the 100-yard line.",32,mtms2010-10-139a,,
scoRing,33,mtms2010-10-139a,,
"A player scores 6 points for a touchdown by reaching the 100-yard line and then has the option of winning 1 or 2 extra points. To score 1 extra point, the player must draw a 10, jack,  queen, or king from the passing pile. To score 2 extra points, the player must draw a queen or a king from the running pile. Teachers can ask players to discuss the probabilities of scoring 1 or 2 extra points and the decisions they might make for these two options.  penalties",34,mtms2010-10-139a,,
"After students are comfortable playing the game, the teacher can introduce the idea of penalties. A penalty is a loss of 5 yards. It will occur if one student makes a computational error and the other student catches it. Students automatically become more careful in their calculations and pay closer attention to the game when there is a potential loss of yardage.  conclUsion",35,mtms2010-10-139a,,
"An added benefit I found when using this game is the collaboration that occurs among groups. My students who were on the football team were always ready to help other students who were unfamiliar with the rules of the game. Through this collaborative effort, students practice both addition and subtraction of integers to help solidify their knowledge of integers. Although each student can have his or her own score sheet, I normally ask a team to share one sheet so that I can more easily see the progression of their game and ensure that all understand the integer rules. After several games of “integer football,” most students have mastered the rules of integer  addition and subtraction.",36,mtms2010-10-139a,,
