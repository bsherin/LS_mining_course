0,Going Off-the-Pegs_ Revisiting Geoboard Squares - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,How many squares can be found on a typical 5  5 geoboard? Teachers who are unfamiliar with this question may wish to stop here and reflect a bit. The question can lead to wonderful student discourse: How can we tell if something is a square? Do we count squares that are the same size (but in a different location) or just different sizes? How do we know if squares are different sizes? How many squares are on an N N geoboard?,,
1,Going Off-the-Pegs_ Revisiting Geoboard Squares - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Teachers who are familiar with this question, which is often used to promote open-ended investigations, may think of what we call usual squares because they all have vertices on the pegs, such as in figure 1. Note that only single, isolated geoboards are being considered throughout this article; we are not using connected geoboards, which can be created by combining separate geoboards.",,
2,Going Off-the-Pegs_ Revisiting Geoboard Squares - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Much has been written about usual squares (fig. 1), which have vertices on the pegs (Mooney and Bair 2012; Bennett, Burton, and Nelson 2007; Speck 1979). This article, however, explores what can happen when teachers encourage students to take the reins of a planned investigation and lead it somewhere unexpected. That is what happened after Monique, a student fiddling with rubber bands and a geoboard, held up the example shown in figure 2 and asked, What about squares like this?",,
3,Going Off-the-Pegs_ Revisiting Geoboard Squares - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"When this scenario occurred in author Matthew Ciancettas class with eighth graders, many thoughts ran through his mind:",,
4,Going Off-the-Pegs_ Revisiting Geoboard Squares - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"No, we dont want those. I dont even know if there are any squares there.We want the vertices of the squares to be on the pegs. Didnt I say that? That wasnt part of my lesson plan.  I was aiming for a different diagram [shown in fig. 1].",,
5,Going Off-the-Pegs_ Revisiting Geoboard Squares - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Despite the fleeting thoughts about a lesson going somewhere unplanned, Ciancetta elicited clarification from Monique to learn that what she was interested in were the quadrilaterals formed by her intersecting rubber-band line segments. The class was then encouraged to add Moniques ideas to the list of allowable possibilities. As teachers, we know that one of the many joys of our profession is encouraging students to explore mathematics, often leading to new and unexpected questions.",,
6,Going Off-the-Pegs_ Revisiting Geoboard Squares - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"All three authors have spent time exploring what we are calling Off-the-Peg (OTP) squares with classes of middle school students as well as with preservice middle school teachers. In this article, we will showcase what students meant by OTP squares and how they redefined what it meant to ask, How many squares of differing sizes really can be found on a typical  5  5 geoboard? Along the way, we will profile some insights we gleaned from students about what it really means to do mathematics as they progressed in investigating their  redefined question.",,
7,Going Off-the-Pegs_ Revisiting Geoboard Squares - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Easing Into The Task: What We Did,,
8,Going Off-the-Pegs_ Revisiting Geoboard Squares - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We have taught this OTP square investigation in eighth-grade and ninth-grade classrooms as well as in university classes with preservice teachers while looking at models for measurement of area and length. For instance, in the three sets of squares in figure 1, (a) illustrates various uses of a 1  1 square unit; (b) and (c), which students called tilted squares, invoke side lengths having an irrational measure (NCTM 1999). Our students already knew how to obtain a squares area from its side length (and vice versa), and so the class consensus was to classify two squares as different simply if they had different side lengths or areas. They then focused their investigation on finding squares with different side lengths and not on orientation or placement.",,
9,Going Off-the-Pegs_ Revisiting Geoboard Squares - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"After the students progressed in finding squares, we used this prompt if a student had not already raised it: Are there any other squares that can be made on a 5  5 geoboard just by using the rubber bands? We used that phrasing because when students start making polygonal shapes on a geoboard, many of them automatically put all the vertices on the pegs, even without being directed to do so. Some students, like Monique, use rubber bands as segments from peg to peg, creating shapes from intersecting segments. Can any squares be seen lurking within those created shapes?",,
10,Going Off-the-Pegs_ Revisiting Geoboard Squares - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Exploring on the Physical Geoboard,,
11,Going Off-the-Pegs_ Revisiting Geoboard Squares - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We can usually count on at least one student producing a geoboard resembling figure 2, which we use as a springboard to discuss OTP squares. Taken from a compilation of classes, here is an example of the kind of dialogue that ensued:",,
12,Going Off-the-Pegs_ Revisiting Geoboard Squares - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"After a short discussion addressing Jens question, the class agreed that anything was fair as long as it was formed on a single 5  5 geoboard with rubber bands stretched from peg to peg. In this sense (using rubber bands as segments and pegs as endpoints), a square might emerge having any or all of its vertices off-the-pegs. With this clarification, the class began covering their geoboards with rubber bands, looking for shapes that they suspected might be squares. Because so many possible squares seemed to emerge, we handed out copies of a 5  5 geoboard paper template to help students record what they were doing.",,
13,Going Off-the-Pegs_ Revisiting Geoboard Squares - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Recording Thinking on a Paper Template,,
14,Going Off-the-Pegs_ Revisiting Geoboard Squares - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"After we saw a variety of ideas for OTP squares (or what might turn out to be squares), we put the paper templates on a document camera and asked students to discuss their thinking. In reflecting on figure 3, discourse typically progressed with questions from the class and prompts from the teacher:",,
15,Going Off-the-Pegs_ Revisiting Geoboard Squares - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The class at that point had made a reference to needing 90 degree angles to be a square, so we talked about how to check that on a geoboard. As teachers, we considered our students algebraic knowledge as we processed the notion of perpendicular segments having slopes that were negative reciprocals of one another. In some classes, simply talking in general terms about the slopes seemed to be enough to satisfy students:",,
16,Going Off-the-Pegs_ Revisiting Geoboard Squares - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"After a self-correction (she was counting 5 dots in one direction and 2 spaces in another direction), Jamie reconnected her earlier notions of perpendicular lines to identify slopes of 2 and 1/2. Accepting and using the style of language and analysis that they had used for the tilted usual squares of figure 1, students convinced themselves of the perpendicularity of sides (or lack thereof) of the quadrilaterals in figure 3.",,
17,Going Off-the-Pegs_ Revisiting Geoboard Squares - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Moving to a Dynamic Software Environment,,
18,Going Off-the-Pegs_ Revisiting Geoboard Squares - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"At this point, we had many examples of quadrilaterals with 90 degree  interior angles, and all had at least one OTP vertex (see fig. 4). However, how could we check them for congruent side lengths?",,
19,Going Off-the-Pegs_ Revisiting Geoboard Squares - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Students input generally varied according to their prerequisite knowledge and the kinds of tools they had already used:,,
20,Going Off-the-Pegs_ Revisiting Geoboard Squares - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Rick: We could measure with a ruler.,,
21,Going Off-the-Pegs_ Revisiting Geoboard Squares - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Beng: How about using a compass [as dividers]?,,
22,Going Off-the-Pegs_ Revisiting Geoboard Squares - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Eva: Cant we use Sketchpad [The Geometers Sketchpad]?,,
23,Going Off-the-Pegs_ Revisiting Geoboard Squares - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We knew that we could help steer this situation in different directions and realized that a discussion of approximation and precision might be useful in responding to Rick and Beng, for instance. For classes in which a tie-in to coordinate geometry was appropriate, it might have made sense to move this part of the investigation so that more algebra emerged. Yet the basic mathematical structure and questioning would be the same, whether we used algebra or software: Find the points of intersection of two pairs of segments, and then find the distance between those two points. Also, teachers interested in having their classes apply congruent triangle theorems can find interesting ways of testing for side-length congruency. (See one example in fig. 5.)",,
24,Going Off-the-Pegs_ Revisiting Geoboard Squares - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Thus, we underscore that although it is unnecessary to use dynamic software to check for congruent side lengths (because other techniques are possible), this article highlights part of a classs journey to find and verify OTP squares using Sketchpad. As an example of an appropriate use of technology, our students were comfortable in using a software tool to expedite their goal of finding, verifying, and classifying squares. Whether a class uses coordinate geometry and algebra, geometric theorems about congruency or any other method of checking side-lengths depends largely on the teacher.",,
25,Going Off-the-Pegs_ Revisiting Geoboard Squares - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Because all of our classes could explore this on laptops and were familiar with dynamic geometry software, we went with Evas suggestion and used Sketchpad. Before bringing out the laptop cart, we had the class clearly list what we were looking for, which led to the redefined task being made explicit by the students themselves. Here is an example of a typical classs clarification of guidelines for using software to simulate and investigate:",,
26,Going Off-the-Pegs_ Revisiting Geoboard Squares - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,How many squares of different sizes can you find on a 5  5 geoboard?,,
27,Going Off-the-Pegs_ Revisiting Geoboard Squares - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,1. You have to keep the rubber bands on the geoboard.  This means,,
28,Going Off-the-Pegs_ Revisiting Geoboard Squares - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,a. you can only connect  peg-to-peg segments; and,,
29,Going Off-the-Pegs_ Revisiting Geoboard Squares - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,b. you can use any of the  25 pegs you see.,,
30,Going Off-the-Pegs_ Revisiting Geoboard Squares - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,2. If you see something you think might be a square,,
31,Going Off-the-Pegs_ Revisiting Geoboard Squares - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,a. you have to check for right angles; and,,
32,Going Off-the-Pegs_ Revisiting Geoboard Squares - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,b. you have to check for  congruent sides.,,
33,Going Off-the-Pegs_ Revisiting Geoboard Squares - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"3. Make a note of how many  OTP vertices it can have,  if it is a square.",,
34,Going Off-the-Pegs_ Revisiting Geoboard Squares - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,4. Put the square on the list only if it has an area not already listed.,,
35,Going Off-the-Pegs_ Revisiting Geoboard Squares - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Summarizing The Findings and Extending The Task,,
36,Going Off-the-Pegs_ Revisiting Geoboard Squares - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"As students eagerly took their collection of paper templates (where they had drawn many candidates for OTP squares) to Sketchpad, we realized that this investigation was getting big, and fast. By that we mean that while students were confirming or eliminating squares, more questions were being asked by both students and teachers. One question, prompted by author Stephen Blair, was this: How can we classify the different OTP squares?",,
37,Going Off-the-Pegs_ Revisiting Geoboard Squares - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Among the suggestions from students was an idea that involved the slopes of the segments used for the sides. By this time, students were generally open to using the negative reciprocal notation. In fact, the notion of a slope family of lines became common in one class: Figure 6 depicts the (2 and 1/2) slope family, in which every possible segment connecting two pegs has either a slope of (2) or (1/2).",,
38,Going Off-the-Pegs_ Revisiting Geoboard Squares - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In several classes, something analogous to the idea of slope family arose, and a diagram similar to figure 7 was discussed in terms of the possible slope families that existed on a 5  5 geoboard:",,
39,Going Off-the-Pegs_ Revisiting Geoboard Squares - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Note that in figure 7, the horizontal segment could represent a slope family such as (0, N/0) or (0, undefined). However, students understood that this particular slope family contained only 4 usual squares (having all vertices on the pegs), and they had already analyzed and counted all usual squares (suggested by fig. 1) in prior work.",,
40,Going Off-the-Pegs_ Revisiting Geoboard Squares - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Table 1 represents an example of what some classes found after eliminating redundant slope families and finding and classifying squares of differing dimensions. The table is merely our summary of what students have typically put on the whiteboard as they made changes and updates throughout their investigation on Sketchpad. Our students found 29 total squares having distinct areas, some of which were usual squares and some of which were OTP squares (having at least 1 OTP vertex).",,
41,Going Off-the-Pegs_ Revisiting Geoboard Squares - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"To give an example of what students noticed in the creation of this table, the slope family of (2 and 1/2) had 5 total squares: One usual square (which corresponded to having 0 OTP vertices) and 4 OTP squares (having at least 1 OTP vertex). Some students felt comfortable seeing all squares for a given slope family (as in fig. 8), whereas other students wanted to create separate shaded areas for each distinct square (as in fig. 9).",,
42,Going Off-the-Pegs_ Revisiting Geoboard Squares - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Admittedly these results were obtained by a brute force method, whereby students were motivated to find any and all squares of differing sizes (especially those having at least  1 OTP vertex), abiding by the guidelines they created in their redefined task. But a sense of conjecture and structure is at the heart of mathematics, and looking for patterns and asking questions is among the first steps in what we mean by doing mathematics. Moreover, as new relationships are discovered, students realize that doing mathematics involves more than finding answers or even verifying relationships. Indeed, doing mathematics at its best also involves making connections and seeking insight as to why relationships are true.",,
43,Going Off-the-Pegs_ Revisiting Geoboard Squares - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"To this end, we asked students to list the areas of squares within each slope family. To take just one example, consider figure 9a, showing 5 squares with the indicated areas (in square units).",,
44,Going Off-the-Pegs_ Revisiting Geoboard Squares - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In most of our classes, with both eighth graders and preservice teachers, it usually took little or no prompting for someone to notice that the smallest area times consecutive square numbers (1, 4, 9, . . .) would yield the areas of the other squares in that slope family. As another example, consider figure 9b, showing six squares in the (2/3 and 3/2) slope family, which have the indicated areas (in square units). This idea holds for each slope family.",,
45,Going Off-the-Pegs_ Revisiting Geoboard Squares - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Why does this relationship exist? As students reflected on their findings, noticed connections, and wondered which relations held and why, we ended up with many more questions. Some questions came from students, and others came from us. We have continued working with this task outside of class and found ourselves asking:",,
46,Going Off-the-Pegs_ Revisiting Geoboard Squares - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Leaving with more questions than when they had started, students who participated in this investigation gained a sense that mathematics does not need to end with an answer. In a very real way, problem posing and inquiry, empowerment and exploration have all been key themes in our classrooms as we explored OTP squares on the geoboard.",,
47,Going Off-the-Pegs_ Revisiting Geoboard Squares - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,What it Means to Do Mathematics,,
48,Going Off-the-Pegs_ Revisiting Geoboard Squares - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"This exploration led us in unexpected directions as we often learned and discovered alongside our students. Although new to our students and us, we later learned that the topic of OTP squares was not an original idea. Although Masalski (1974) directly addressed the concept and wrote about the mathematical aspects of the task, we found great value in having our students explore it as part of a dynamic classroom investigation.",,
49,Going Off-the-Pegs_ Revisiting Geoboard Squares - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Teachers who try this with their classes will find it easy to segue into this investigation of OTP squares once students have explored geoboard polygons, with all vertices on the pegs. Depending on the schedule, this task can turn into a multiday investigation, a group project, or even something in which participants collaborate online. Alternatives to using technological resources include measurement (e.g., using rulers and protractors), coordinate geometry (e.g., using algebraic techniques to find side lengths), or relying on geometric proofs (e.g., using properties of congruent figures). We suggest allowing the sophistication of the class, along with available resources and goals of the teacher, to dictate which approaches are relevant and useful.",,
50,Going Off-the-Pegs_ Revisiting Geoboard Squares - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"For several reasons, this investigation, led by student inquiry in a direction different than originally intended by the teacher, ultimately held a great deal of wealth for what it means to do mathematics. First, a beautiful aspect of mathematics is in exploring something for which an answer is unknown. For all three authors, there were aspects of this investigation that we were initially exploring alongside our students. Second, the sense of noticing, wondering, making conjectures, and solving problems systematically are all hallmarks of genuine mathematical practice. This investigation provided many avenues for students to define a problem and apply tools in the journey toward a solution. Third, and most important in our view, this investigation encouraged students to be authors and owners of new questions. As we reflected on the journey from usual squares (our original lesson plan) to where we ended in looking at OTP squares, we realized that much depended on the inquiring nature of our students and the freedom to explore where their inquisitiveness led.",,
