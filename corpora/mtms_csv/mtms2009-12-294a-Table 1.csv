Middle school teachers in Central Texas and rural Guatemala have some mathematics in common. ,4,mtms2009-12-294a,,
These students learn about the relationship between the volume of regular prisms and pyramids with different bases in models that were inspired by Mayan and Egyptian cultures. Students may have explored the volume of a pyramid (V = (1/3) × area-of-base × height) using squares as the base.,5,mtms2009-12-294a,,
This activity explores this question:    Does the volume formula still hold if we consider a pyramid with a base that is not a square?,6,mtms2009-12-294a,,
"In rural Guatemala, where the  majority of students and teachers are of Mayan descent, students color what they call “La Cruz Maya,” or The Mayan Cross (see fig. 1). This geometric design has special properties that are meaningful in Mayan culture, especially for the Cakchiquel Maya. Their Tzolkin calendar includes a geometric design that has an area of 13 units and a perimeter of 20 units, which represents the 260 days in the calendar (Morley and Brainerd 1983). It is speculated among Mayan descendants that this design resembles the base for many of their pyramids. Teachers can use this activity to explore the volume  of a prism and pyramids with different bases while teaching Mayan mathematics that goes beyond their numeration system (Farmer and Powers 2005). By exploring the volume of Mayan  and Egyptian pyramids, students in the middle grades should be able to— •	 develop	strategies	to	determine	 the volume of selected prisms and pyramids; •	 use	three-dimensional	representations to visualize and solve problems involving area and volume; •	 use	geometric	models	to	represent	 and explain numerical and algebraic relationships; and •	 recognize	and	apply	geometric	 ideas and relationships in subjects outside the mathematics classroom, such as art, science, and everyday life (NCTM 2000).",7,mtms2009-12-294a,,

The goal of this activity is to derive the formula for the volume of two pyramids with different bases. Students will use activity sheet 1 and 2 and snap cubes to build models for the prisms and pyramids and calculate their volumes and ratios. ,9,mtms2009-12-294a,,
"Activity sheet 1 asks students to  focus on building the first four rectangular prisms and pyramids with square bases and measuring their volume. As they measure the volume of the first four models, students can observe that the areas of the bases for the block prisms are square numbers (1, 4, 9, 16, etc.) and the respective volumes are cubic numbers (1, 8, 27, etc.). The volumes of the block pyramids are sums of square numbers (1, 1 + 4, 1 + 4 + 9, 1 + 4 + 9 + 16, etc.). Teachers can take the opportunity to relate these particular computations to the use of the recursive formula for finding the next term in the sequence; they can then explain that the calculations in the table can be completed without having to build all the models. ",10,mtms2009-12-294a,,
"In activity sheet 2, students conduct the same steps but with a different base by using the Mayan cross. The patterns for the Mayan block prisms and block pyramids in this activity are more complex. Students should be encouraged to notice the patterns in relation to the block prisms and block pyramids from activity sheet 1. For example, the areas of the bases for the Mayan block pyramid are 13, 52, 117, and so on. If these quantities are rewritten as 13, 13 × 4, 13 × 9, students should see that each area is 13 times the area of the bases of the Egyptian block pyramid. Teachers can make this clear by pointing out that it takes 13 block prisms (or cubes, in this case) to make the Mayan block prisms in activity sheet 2. Similarly, the volumes of the Mayan block pyramids are 13, 65, 182, and so on. If the quantities are rewritten as 13, 13 × 5, 13 × 14, it ",11,mtms2009-12-294a,,
The block construction of this Mayan pyramid shows how one layer is built on the next.  is again clear that each volume is thirteen times the volume of the Egyptian block pyramid. ,12,mtms2009-12-294a,,
"As students compute the volume  ratio in the last column, they will note that they are the same for both pyramids. Specifically, they approach 1/3 at the same rate. Both teachers and students have found this result surprising. Teachers should discuss the observation that the volume of the Mayan pyramid is thirteen times the volume of the Egyptian pyramid and rewrite the ratios for activity sheet 2 as  to demonstrate numerically why the ratios are the same for both pyramids. If this activity is used for preservice middle school teachers who have some calculus background, they can use limits to show that the ratio approaches 1/3 in both situations. ",13,mtms2009-12-294a,,
"Another observation about the  volume ratio is that it is not 1/3 from the beginning, and it keeps changing  as more layers are added. The reason is that block pyramids, comparable to Egyptian and Mayan pyramids, do not have straight edges and flat faces. The models overestimate the volume of a smooth pyramid with the same height and base.",14,mtms2009-12-294a,,
"To illustrate how the overestimation of the volume changes as layers are added to the block pyramids, consider the side views, shown in figure 2. In this two-dimensional picture, the area of the side view of the block pyramid is larger than the area of the triangle. However, as the number of layers increases, the extra area becomes less and less significant. As we build pyramids, an analogous phenomenon will occur with the volume of the block pyramid compared with the volume of a smooth pyramid. Hence, the ratio of the volume of the block pyramid to the volume of the prism decreases little by little, approaching 1/3.",15,mtms2009-12-294a,,

On the second day, students can observe patterns and relationships, share strategies for calculating the volume of each pyramid, and derive the general formula.
