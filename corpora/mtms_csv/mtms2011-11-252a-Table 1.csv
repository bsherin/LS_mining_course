Each chapter outlines important and relevant information for teachers about special education law, intervention plans, and conventional thinking versus new thinking on cognition of math concepts.

"Achieving Fluency is an excellent  primer in teaching special needs students and does not assume any prior knowledge. The authors discuss the history of teaching special populations. That history is compared with what we now know about how deep mathematical understanding is acquired in the brain and how all students can gain access to that understanding with appropriate accommodations. Each chapter outlines expectations for each strand and how teachers can model and challenge students with disabilities. In addition, misunderstandings and misperceptions common to special education students are discussed, and strategies for intervention are explained thoroughly. ",7,mtms2011-11-252a,,
I recommend this book as a compendium for all teachers who struggle to find ways of promoting deep learning of mathematics for all students.,8,mtms2011-11-252a,,

"In mathematics education, researchers, policymakers, and teachers have different immediate goals and timelines. Generally, they agree on the  ultimate goals of improving classroom practice and student learning. Misunderstandings lead to isolation between groups and breakdowns within each group. Much of mathematics education research produces little effect in schools because research is usually written for other researchers. Teachers are often vexed by policies that ignore their problems, and they find little solace with research offering a panacea. And all too often, policymakers seeking quick solutions to problems create unintended consequences. This book offers examples in which researchers, policymakers, and teachers communicate and work together to meet everyone’s needs. “Examining What We Know for Sure: Tracking in Middle Grades Mathematics” by Lee Stiff, Janet Johnson, and Patrick Akos is an eye-opening chapter. In an applied research study in middle school math, discriminatory recommendations by teachers and counselors (most damaging for African American students) are highlighted. How disheartening to learn that placing students in less  rigorous mathematics classes occurs disproportionately across ethnicities. Once placed in less rigorous math classes, a point of no return occurs for students who may have otherwise been successful. ",13,mtms2011-11-252a,,
"Drawing attention to the need  to synthesize findings from multiple audiences in mathematics education is a strength of this book.

Focus in high school  Mathematics: Fostering Reasoning and sense Making for all students,18,mtms2011-11-252a,,

"This book is one in a series about reasoning and sense making in high school mathematics; meeting this need for all groups of students is its focus. Each of the six chapters addresses ways of fostering reasoning skills and ensuring an opportunity for all students to learn mathematics, including English language learners, students with disabilities, and advanced students.",20,mtms2011-11-252a,,
A common theme of each chapter  is that all students must have access to highly qualified teachers who are willing to move away from traditional methods of teaching toward providing students with rich problems and problem-solving tasks as a way of developing reasoning habits. This approach has the added benefit of including all students and giving each one the opportunity to experience success in mathematics. Anecdotal evidence is given of schools that have successfully modeled this approach. ,21,mtms2011-11-252a,,
"The chapters each provide supporting evidence for the benefits of building reasoning and sense-making skills for students. It seems clear that to develop this pedagogical approach on an institutional basis requires dedicated time for teachers to work together. An additional chapter or two that includes more detail about how this approach is implemented in the classroom, along with books and websites that provide rich problems, would give teachers a jump start in their own classrooms or schools.",22,mtms2011-11-252a,,
I would recommend this book to groups of teachers who have the opportunity to work together to develop this approach in their school.,23,mtms2011-11-252a,,

"This seventy-third yearbook gives readers an overview of some of the different ideas concerning motivation and dispositions as they relate to topics in mathematics education and mathematics education documents, like  the Standards. Math content ranges from working with base-ten blocks for double-digit subtraction to working with students in a college calculus class. Readers can likely adapt many authors’ suggestions, regardless of the grade level addressed. ",29,mtms2011-11-252a,,
"A strength of the yearbook is that  even though authors draw from a variety of ideas, there is consistency in the message of the text. This message is the importance of providing ways to engage students in learning math (and in wanting to learn math) while also increasing their autonomy, competence, persistence, and self-confidence. Most of the chapters provide specific ways for teachers to think about using ideas linked with research in their own classrooms. For instance, Wilburne and Keat (2011) suggest using storybooks to promote mathematical problem solving, whereas Cai and Merlino (2011) advocate using metaphors to help assess students’ mathematical dispositions. The section on cultural and societal issues provides pertinent discussions of how to support rural and aboriginal students, for example. ",30,mtms2011-11-252a,,
"Many of the chapters would likely  be of interest to preservice teachers within a methods course. Clearly, the benefit of this text is giving the reader ideas about how (with some very concrete ways) to assist teachers in helping more students like math and feel more confident in their ability to do math.  —Sarah A.

"Middle School Math Interventions  was written for use with students in grades 5-9 who have difficulty with  six common problem areas in mathematics. These problem areas, determined from surveying hundreds of teachers, include  multiplication, division, fractions, decimals, algebra, and word problems. Seltzer focuses on these areas by devoting a chapter to each and outlines, in a step-by-step approach, strategies for reteaching these concepts to struggling students.",35,mtms2011-11-252a,,

"Chapters begin with definitions, vocabulary, and properties surrounding each skill. Expectations of students, what common mistakes are made, and research about student performance are then outlined for each skill. Models, hints, and keys for memorization follow, along with practice problems and a final test to check student mastery. A notable strength of the book is the use of pattern blocks throughout the fraction chapter. This modeling allows the student to visualize fractions, which is a hard concept for many students. Another highlight is the inclusion of the text on CD with software that supports its display on a SMART Board®. ",37,mtms2011-11-252a,,
"My only criticism is that practice  problems are embedded in the text, so extracting them for blackline copies or use on a SMART Board could be cumbersome. Despite this, Seltzer has written a useful book for teachers who wish to help students master common errors in their basic math skills.",38,mtms2011-11-252a,,
