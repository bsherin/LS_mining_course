Many Facets,1,mtms2010-09-110a,,
"Manipulatives and technology can model the scaffolding of language acquisition while teaching algebra and geometry.  rRecent research indicates that the  methodology for teaching English language learners (ELLs) is unique (Echevarría, Vogt, and Short 2008). One approach most commonly used to teach this group in the United States is referred to as sheltered instruction (Crawford 2004). With Sheltered English Immersion (SEI), middle school teachers simultaneously teach content and language skills. I will explore how to integrate manipulatives and technology into a lesson that incorporates major components of Structured English Immersion. ",2,mtms2010-09-110a,,
"An effective SEI teacher incorporates listening, speaking, reading, and writing in mathematics content and language instruction (Gibbons 2002). According to Echevarría, Vogt, and Short (2008), best practices of SEI include the following topics:  •	 Identifying	mathematics	and	language objectives •	 Activating	students’	prior	knowledge •	 Developing	vocabulary •	 Using	visuals	and	manipulatives •	 Modeling	and	enacting	real-world	 experiences  •	 Assessing	both	content	and	language objectives ",3,mtms2010-09-110a,,
"The lesson described here demonstrates SEI components while using technology. The components of effective SEI practices in this article come directly from the Structured Instruction Observation Protocol designed by Echevarría, Vogt, and Short (2008).",4,mtms2010-09-110a,,
Using technology in instruction is a way to transition ELLs to the mainstream	curriculum	(Donnelly	 2007).	The	lesson	titled	“Using	Euler’s	,5,mtms2010-09-110a,,
Formula:	Discovering	Patterns	in	,6,mtms2010-09-110a,,
Three-Dimensional	Solids”	is	designed for ELLs in grades 5 through 8. It incorporates structured English immersion methodology while content and language are discussed. ,7,mtms2010-09-110a,,
"The lesson was taught to a group of sixth-grade through eighth-grade English language learners. They were asked to explore a collection of geometric solids. Half the lesson (3 of 6 hours) was conducted in the classroom; the other half was conducted in the computer lab. The student work demonstrates how incorporating technology-supported pedagogy  can promote student understanding (Cummins, Brown, and Sayers 2007).",8,mtms2010-09-110a,,
Math content and language,9,mtms2010-09-110a,,
"Posting, reviewing, and assessing mathematics and language objectives throughout	the	lesson	are	a	teacher’s	 responsibility. It is important for ELLs	to	know	the	lesson’s	intent	 (Echevarría, Vogt, and Short 2008), especially since content and language objectives must follow state mathematics and language standards. The objectives for this lesson are explored below. ",10,mtms2010-09-110a,,
Mathematics Objective,11,mtms2010-09-110a,,
Students will analyze the attributes and properties of three-dimensional solids and develop mathematical arguments about their relationships.,12,mtms2010-09-110a,,
Language Objectives,13,mtms2010-09-110a,,
Listening and speaking: Students will express similarities and differences found for three-dimensional solids. Reading: Students will read instructions on how to complete an Excel file.,14,mtms2010-09-110a,,
Wrting: Students will write similarities and differences found for threedimensional solids. ,15,mtms2010-09-110a,,
Linking Past Learning,16,mtms2010-09-110a,,
"Making	links	to	past	learning	allows	 students to understand the connection between previous concepts and new concepts introduced in class (Echevarría, Vogt, and Short 2008). Past learning serves as an anchor for ELLs who then can build a bridge to new learning. To make the connection, the teacher briefly reviewed the previous lesson, which discussed two-dimensional geometric figures. A quick review of the names of these geometric figures demonstrated to ELLs that the current lesson on three-dimensional solids was a continuation of the previous one.",17,mtms2010-09-110a,,
Activating Prior Knowledge,18,mtms2010-09-110a,,
"New knowledge builds on old knowledge.	Regardless	of	the	lesson’s	concepts,	teachers	must	activate	students’	 prior knowledge (Echevarría, Vogt, and Short 2008). Although important in all contexts, it is especially important for ELLs. Teachers sometimes ",19,mtms2010-09-110a,,
Fig. 1 A student described the properties of a rectangular prism and a triangular prism before key terminology was taught.,20,mtms2010-09-110a,,
"fail to see the importance of activating prior knowledge; others do not know how. Even though ELLs may be unfamiliar	with	the	lesson’s	topic,	they	 may be familiar with the overarching concept. For instance, ELLs may not know about the Holocaust; however, they may have experienced prejudice and discrimination. This is the prior knowledge the teacher must activate.",21,mtms2010-09-110a,,
"In this lesson, ELLs were given six  three-dimensional solids to analyze. They worked in cooperative groups and used a Venn diagram to compare and contrast two of the solids. Since this activity was completed before the teacher introduced key vocabulary, the descriptive words used by the students were from their own working vocabulary. (See fig. 1’s	Venn	diagram.)	 introducing vocabulary",22,mtms2010-09-110a,,
"After students shared their Venn diagrams, the teacher introduced the lesson’s	vocabulary.	The	number	of	 vocabulary terms identified for this lesson was limited to face, edge, and vertex. Pointing to each one of the attributes as they were found in the classroom scaffolded vocabulary. For example, the instructor pointed to the faces of the room, and students formulated their own definition of a face while working in groups. Each group shared its own definition of the term. To further scaffold the definition of terms, students were given sentence frameworks.	(One	group’s	sentence	 framework is shown in fig. 2.) ",23,mtms2010-09-110a,,
Meaningful Activities,24,mtms2010-09-110a,,
"Once students recognized vocabulary in the real world, they used it to identify the number of faces, edges, and vertices found in six different three-dimensional models: a cube, a triangular prism, a rectangular prism, a hexagonal prism, a square pyramid, and a tetrahedron. This information was recorded in an attribute chart. (See an example in fig. 3.)",25,mtms2010-09-110a,,
Fig. 2 Explanations and definitions in this sentence framework were useful for instruction as well as assessment. ,26,mtms2010-09-110a,,

"ing listening, speaking, reading, and writing (Echevarría, Vogt, and Short 2008). The computer lab was an ideal place for this purpose. To give students additional practice recognizing the attributes of solids in a two-dimensional plane, they labeled a face, an edge, and a vertex of a cube in a Word document. They also counted the faces, edges, and vertices of the dodecahedron in the Geometric Solids lesson found on NCTM’s	Illuminations	Web	site	(see	 illuminations.nctm.org/activitydetail.",44,mtms2010-09-110a,,

Students then opened and filled the cells in an Excel spreadsheet file ,46,mtms2010-09-110a,,
"Fig. 3 This geometric solids attribute chart incorporated many aspects of shapes.  As students built the table, patterns and relationships emerged.",47,mtms2010-09-110a,,
"In their groups, students found the patterns that existed among the faces, edges, and vertices of each solid. The intent of this activity was to generate Euler’s	formula.	After	some	brainstorming, students came up with three versions of the formula, F for faces, V for vertices, and E for edges: 1.  F + V – E = 2 2.  F + V – 2 = E 3.  F – 2 + V = E",48,mtms2010-09-110a,,

Review and Assessment,64,mtms2010-09-110a,,
"Key concepts and vocabulary review as well as assessment were accomplished by giving students opportunities to demonstrate mastery of knowledge and skills (Echevarría, Vogt, and Short 2008). Students determined a missing attribute of fictitious threedimensional	solids	using	Euler’s	 formula F + V − E = 2, for example, by being asked this question:   What is the missing addend in the following three-dimensional solid? 8 + ___ − 12 = 2",65,mtms2010-09-110a,,
Students practiced until they mastered the	formula’s	application.,66,mtms2010-09-110a,,

The last step for students was to figure out the number of faces for each polyhedral, which was the missing attribute. ",68,mtms2010-09-110a,,
"The assessment consisted of an  attribute chart with the names of ten three-dimensional solids with one missing attribute. (See fig. 5.) Students provided the missing attribute by	applying	Euler’s	formula.	The	average score on this independent assignment was 90 percent. Students were also asked to explain, in writing, how they found their answers. Both pieces of the assessment became part of the students’	portfolio.	 conclusion",69,mtms2010-09-110a,,
"This article emphasizes the need for instruction that is tailored to the unique challenges of learning English and content simultaneously. Through effective SEI practices, middle school math teachers can make subject matter comprehensible while promoting English language development. Integrating manipulatives and technology into a lesson can incorporate major components of Structured English Immersion. Using a specific math topic, precise suggestions are given about how to scaffold language and content learning for English language learners in the mainstream classroom. ",70,mtms2010-09-110a,,
