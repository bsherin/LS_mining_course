3,Mathematical Explorations: Will It Terminate?,"Can your students tell at a glance whether a fraction will terminate or repeat when written as a decimal? Students’ facility with numbers includes understanding how numbers behave when divided. Many students know that thirds and ninths repeat, but a true understanding of the underlying principle of factors will make this determination obvious to all students who master the “big idea.”",3,Mathematical Explorations: Will It Terminate?
4,Mathematical Explorations: Will It Terminate?,"Too often, teachers lack time and tend to focus more on what students can do rather than on how much they understand. The following explorations were developed to meet the needs of my sixth-grade students who needed help making connections about underlying patterns but who still benefited from opportunities to extend their learning.

6,Mathematical Explorations: Will It Terminate?,"Because the only prime factors of 10 are 2 and 5, the only fractions that terminate when written as decimals have denominators exclusively composed of prime factors 2 and 5. This big idea is found in the teacher’s guide of the math textbook we use. To facilitate my students’ discovery of this idea, I developed this exploration.",6,Mathematical Explorations: Will It Terminate?

8,Mathematical Explorations: Will It Terminate?,Inquiry-based learning using different investigations that allow for differentiation is the key to this activity. The first investigation asks students to practice their long division skills. Students work in pairs to write assigned fractions as decimals and determine whether they will terminate or repeat. Each exploration “level” contains two fractions: One will terminate and one will repeat. Students who have ,8,Mathematical Explorations: Will It Terminate?

Students are also asked to describe in words how they know that they have discovered that a fraction will repeat when written as a decimal. This description will help students ensure that they understand repeating decimals by asking them to articulate key features. Students at each level can share their results before beginning the second investigation. ",11,Mathematical Explorations: Will It Terminate?
12,Mathematical Explorations: Will It Terminate?,"The first year of the exploration, I allowed students to use calculators first to predict whether the number would terminate or repeat, then to check their answers with long division. Teachers would be advised to avoid this sequence because it leads students to erroneously conjecture that fractions with 7 as a factor in the denominator will terminate. Instead, permitting calculator use in the extension allows strong students to think about how calculators round decimals. Once they have internalized which fractions will repeat and which will terminate, students can also begin to appreciate how many decimal places are involved in the repeating number.",12,Mathematical Explorations: Will It Terminate?
13,Mathematical Explorations: Will It Terminate?,"The second investigation has the  same objective of providing long division practice and the same three levels of differentiation. The pairs of fractions in this investigation have either the same numerator and a different denominator or the same denominator and a different numerator. Students complete two more long divisions tasks, one terminating and one repeating, so that they can have a basis from which to make their conjectures. Teachers are encouraged to use the jigsaw model to limit the number of long division problems that each student performs. Although strong students may find long division practice tedious, my experience is that they consider the hardest ones puzzles to be cracked. The entire class tackled  the long division problem of 9/17; proving their conjecture that it would repeat gave them a tremendous sense of satisfaction. ",13,Mathematical Explorations: Will It Terminate?
14,Mathematical Explorations: Will It Terminate?,"The long division itself is valuable because it helps students understand what repeats means in terms of the behavior of the numbers when divided. Teachers should watch for students who do not know when to stop the long division process; some will continue to divide until they are cued to recognize the repetition. Stronger students can be expected to recognize on their own when the quotient has begun to repeat. However, to prevent frustration and wasted time, ask weaker students ahead of time how they will recognize when they are done. Students should articulate that they need not look not for the same number in the quotient but rather look for the same difference repeated when the quotient is multiplied by the divisor and the result is subtracted from the remainder.",14,Mathematical Explorations: Will It Terminate?
15,Mathematical Explorations: Will It Terminate?,"For example, for the long division of 9 ÷ 17 in figure 1, it can be a challenge to determine when the quotient begins to repeat. Ask students to explain why that scenario means that they are done, both generally and specifically. Early in this long division, notice the 5 circled in red. The next step is to divide the difference by the divisor, in this case, 50 divided by 17, but it will always go in the same number of times, so we will again get the number 2 in the quotient. Two times 17 is 34, which subtracted from 50 leaves 16. We will keep dividing the same series of numbers by the same dividend, which will loop around again and again every time we see a 5 as the remainder.",15,Mathematical Explorations: Will It Terminate?
16,Mathematical Explorations: Will It Terminate?,"It may be wise to overshoot a little  to show students that this principle works, as shown in figure 1. There, the students saw the repetition begin one digit earlier in the quotient, but they kept going one more decimal  fig. 1 Showing more than is necessary will help solidify students’ understanding.",16,Mathematical Explorations: Will It Terminate?

A teacher who advises his or her students to do this (look for two consecutive repeated differences) needs to remind them that the repetition actually began with the first difference and not to include repeated numbers under the bar. Students who divide 7/11 might incorrectly write the decimal as 0.636 they should really write  0.636 0.63.,17,Mathematical Explorations: Will It Terminate?

21,Mathematical Explorations: Will It Terminate?,"Teachers should also ask them to explain their reasoning and should be prepared to ask guiding questions to students with different levels of understanding. Students who are having difficulty devising a conjecture should be asked what changes they noticed from the first investigation to the second.  •	 When	the	students	changed	 the numerator, did that impact whether the fraction terminated  or repeated? •	 When	they	changed	the	denomi- nator, did that have an impact?",21,Mathematical Explorations: Will It Terminate?

24,Mathematical Explorations: Will It Terminate?,"Students are only focusing on two pairs of fractions, so many of them should notice that the denominator determines repeating or terminating. Those who successfully conjecture that the denominator is responsible should be asked if they notice anything in common among the terminating denominators (in these explorations, 8, 10, 16, 20, 25, and 32).  guiding students to the appropriate conclusion",24,Mathematical Explorations: Will It Terminate?
25,Mathematical Explorations: Will It Terminate?,"Discussion between the second and third investigations allows students to  agree on a conjecture to investigate. Students who are not convinced may want to look at the results of other students (or student groups). They should see that two fractions can have the same numerator yet one will repeat and one will not, particularly if students focused on the same exploration level in each of the first two investigations. The teacher can ask a student who is unsure, “Did 5/7 and 5/8 both repeat, both terminate, or did they act differently when written as decimals?”",25,Mathematical Explorations: Will It Terminate?
26,Mathematical Explorations: Will It Terminate?,"To solidify the hypothesis that the denominator is the determinant, students record which fractions terminated and which repeated in separate sections of the handout. They then write the prime factorization of each denominator. Students should realize quickly that only 2s and 5s are in the fractions that terminate when written as decimals. ",26,Mathematical Explorations: Will It Terminate?
27,Mathematical Explorations: Will It Terminate?,"This investigation should conclude with a discussion that allows students to sharpen their understanding. For example, fractions with 12 and 75 as denominators will repeat when written as decimals because 3 is a factor of their denominators. The conclusion of the lesson should return to the word “decimal”: The denominator matters because it is the number of pieces into which the numerator is being divided. Many teachers use the term decimal fractions to refer to decimals because all terminating decimals can be written as fractions with denominators that are powers of ten.",27,Mathematical Explorations: Will It Terminate?
28,Mathematical Explorations: Will It Terminate?,"If students are adept at scaling up fractions, they should be able to see that any fraction that will terminate when written as a decimal has an equivalent fraction whose denominator is a power of ten. In the case of 5/8, the teacher can show the students  that it is equivalent to 625/1000. If the denominator contains factors that are not 2s and 5s, there will be no way to rewrite the fraction with a denominator that is a power of ten. Challenge or practice problems can approach this topic at a number of levels to reinforce this idea and allow students to verify (for the lowest-level students) or extend and apply (for stronger ones). Students can, for example, all be given the same fraction that will terminate when written as a decimal and be given the following tasks, based on level: 1.  Write the prime factorization of  the denominator.",28,Mathematical Explorations: Will It Terminate?

32,Mathematical Explorations: Will It Terminate?,"Students who are moving more quickly than their peers can work in groups on fractions whose denominators are multiples of 3 or 11, which repeat, as well as fractions whose denominators mix 3s and 11s with 2s and 5s, such as 88 and 165. If students have demonstrated mastery of long division, it may be wise to allow them to use calculators.",32,Mathematical Explorations: Will It Terminate?
33,Mathematical Explorations: Will It Terminate?,"Students should then be advised to  watch for rounding, and the teacher should introduce or reinforce the idea that a repeating decimal is more precise than a calculator approximation. Students should note that additional factors of 2 in the denominator sometimes delay the onset of the repeating decimal. However, they should note that some fractions have not been simplified and that the effect of factors in the denominator that are also in the numerator simplify to  1, so 10/88 is the same as 5/44. This will make their work on the check for understanding more productive.",33,Mathematical Explorations: Will It Terminate?

35,Mathematical Explorations: Will It Terminate?,"Finally, students are given a task that asks them to test two fractions based on our conclusions in class. In level 1 and level 2, both fractions have the same numerator to avoid numerator confusion, in keeping with the general philosophy that it is most efficient to check for understanding of one expectation only. Students can quickly factor and circle denominators in levels 1 and 2, which the teacher can check at a glance. This should clarify to the teacher which students may need additional support. Students who complete the  level 3 question will have to simplify the fractions first, presumably noticing that 3/300 is really 1/100. If they did the extension investigation, however, they should already be familiar with this concept. The “aha!” moment occurs when the fraction that looks less likely to yield a terminating decimal (3/300) actually produces one. If they had to guess, many students would assume that 2/300 would terminate because its numerator is even.",35,Mathematical Explorations: Will It Terminate?

37,Mathematical Explorations: Will It Terminate?,"The extension assignment’s openended approach means that students must construct appropriate responses (instead of just using a calculator to check a set of fractions that were given to them). It is best suited for strong students, particularly the suggestion that the numerators be large. This requires students to think carefully about what factors are in the fraction, instead of just picking small numbers or simple primes. As additional practice for weaker students, the teacher may want to provide the numerator and ask the students to devise appropriate denominators that will make the fraction terminate or repeat.",37,Mathematical Explorations: Will It Terminate?

39,Mathematical Explorations: Will It Terminate?,"Teachers trying to cover a specific set of expectations are well served by tasks that allow students to build their proficiency in different areas (factors, division, simplifying, writing repeating decimals, and so on) at the same time. Differentiation allows students to approach the same lesson at their own pace at a level of depth that will best extend their own learning. Students come away with a sense of how numbers behave and how the decimal system works, and are equipped to apply and extend their knowledge.",39,Mathematical Explorations: Will It Terminate?
