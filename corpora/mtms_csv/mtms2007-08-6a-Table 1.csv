Not All Manipulatives and Models Are Created Equal,2,mtms2007-08-6a,,
"The vision of the mathematics curriculum articulated in Principles and Standards for School Mathematics (NCTM 2000) calls for students to construct their own understanding of mathematical ideas by making, refining, and exploring conjectures based on evidence and use of a variety of reasoning and proof techniques (p. 3). For many of us who struggled to learn mathematics through a chalk-and-talk, do-it-my-way approach to mathematics instruction, the notion of using models and manipulatives to help the learner construct mathematics knowledge is both refreshing and exciting. The process of constructing knowledge often begins with collecting data related to a phenomenon, organizing the data, and making a conjecture based on observed patterns. Gathering accurate data that can lead to a generalization and the discovery of mathematical ideas is key to constructing mathematical knowledge. The teacher plays a critical role in this discovery process. The Professional Standards for Teaching Mathematics (NCTM 1991) charges teachers with the responsibility of designing  and implementing quality mathematical tasks that engage students. “The mathematics tasks in which students engage . . . and the materials with which they work frame and focus students’ opportunities for learning mathematics” (NCTM 1991, p. 24). Lappan reiterates NCTM’s position by stating, “No other decision that teachers make has greater impact on students’ opportunity to learn and on their perceptions about mathematics than the selection or creation of the tasks with which the teacher engages the students in studying mathematics. Here the teacher is the architect, the designer of the curriculum” (Lappan 1993, p. 524). ",3,mtms2007-08-6a,,
"Several years ago, I began my search  for a hands-on experience to model the triangle inequality theorem for my students that would guide them toward meaningful understanding. The theorem states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle is greater than the length of the third side. I encountered several activities that suggested using toothpicks (NCTM 1989, p. 113; Toumasis 1992). The tasks required students to attempt to con- sally Roberts, s.k.roberts@wayne .edu, teaches mathematics content and methods courses for elementary and middle school mathematics teachers at Wayne State University, Detroit, MI 48202.

"Yes struct a triangle with a specified number of toothpicks. The activity sounded perfect. Toothpicks as a manipulative are good for several reasons: they are a uniform nonstandard unit of measure, are easily found, and are inexpensive. In addition, the activity was student- and data-driven. I tried the activity at home before presenting it in class and was pleased with the results. Figure 1 shows the task that I presented to my students, along with the anticipated responses. My plan was to extend the activity to 8 and 9 total toothpicks, then ask students to record all the possible solutions, or types of triangles, with their corresponding side measures.",15,mtms2007-08-6a,,
"I confidently began the activity. As I circulated around the room, I noted that David had recorded that it was possible to form a triangle with sides of lengths 1, 1, and 2 units. When I asked David to “show me” his triangle, with some persistence and fiddling he showed me the diagram in figure 2. Now I faced a teaching dilemma. It was clearly evident that when I had tested the toothpick model at home, my hands-on experience was guided by the fact that I already knew the desired outcome. My students, however, were motivated by their determination and persistence to make a triangle with each set of toothpicks. Abandoning ship and regrouping became the best strategy. I resorted to my old standby chalk-andtalk explanation relating triangles to cupboard doors or shutters in the hopes that I could convince students that David’s representation was not possible. My explanation was situated in the  suspected that most of my students did not have my prior experience hanging cupboard doors or shutters.",16,mtms2007-08-6a,,
"Undaunted by this experience and equipped with a better understanding of what to expect from my students, I searched for a better model. I found an activity on the Internet that suggested using shoestring licorice that had been cut to different lengths for the sides of the triangle. The possibility of using an edible manipulative was very tempting, but I had learned my lesson. The lack of rigid materials, and my students’ determination to reshape the manipulative and make it work at any cost, brought me quickly to my senses. I envisioned scenarios similar to my toothpick encounters. I checked out activities using Cuisenaire rods but knew that they could also lead to the likelihood of inaccurate data.

"I was introduced to The Geometer’s Sketchpad. Surely the precision offered by the computer would counter my students’ ability to manipulate their figures. I considered presenting the investigation shown in figure 4 to my students. Although the activity clearly illustrates that the sum of the measures of the two shorter sides cannot equal the measure of the third side, I felt like there was something missing. I was concerned that from this example some students would not make the leap to ",18,mtms2007-08-6a,,

I explained that when hanging two doors, you want them to meet in the middle. Thus, the sum of the measures of the widths of the doors would equal the width of the opening. If the sum of the measures is less than the opening, a gap would result; if the sum of the measures of the doors is greater than the opening, an “unwanted” triangle would be formed. I drew the sketch in figure 3 on the board to further illustrate my point. Although I observed some understanding nods from my students, I was fairly sure that most of them were not following my example. I ",19,mtms2007-08-6a,,

"Fig.   A Polystrip triangle m  AC  =  5  cm m  AB + m  BC  =  5  cm whole numbers, knowing that decimal representations could potentially distract some students from the task at hand. I could change the preferences so that the measures would automatically round to the nearest unit instead of the nearest hundredth of a unit, but that change would lead to misleading data, as figure 5 demonstrates. The computer representation of the triangle inequality theorem worked and came closer to the model that I was searching for, but something still seemed to be missing. Did I need to return to the days of old and become the all-knowing teacher who imparts the facts to my students, with the expectation that they will dutifully memorize my words and apply them with or without understanding? What was I missing? ",22,mtms2007-08-6a,,
"The perfect model would need to include some way to accurately determine units of measure for each side of the triangle and would require that students form rigid triangles. This would mean anchoring the triangle in some way at each vertex. For this task, I tried Polystrips, which are plastic strips that come in six-inch and twelve-inch lengths that have evenly spaced holes approximately every one-half inch. Fasteners are provided to anchor the vertices. A variety of plastic manipulative strips with fasteners are available. However, some of the holes are not uniformly spaced so they do not lend themselves to a common unit of measure. Before beginning the activity, I asked my students how we could use the strips to determine the  length for the sides of each triangle formed. I wanted to minimize the likelihood that students would generate incorrect data, knowing that the natural tendency was for students to count the holes rather than the distance between the holes when determining the lengths of the segments in units. I also modeled how a triangle could be formed without connecting the strips end to end (see fig. 6). Using the strips in this way would increase the number of possible triangles that students could generate, creating a larger set of data. Students completed figure 7’s triangle record sheet while working in groups. ",23,mtms2007-08-6a,,
"After the groups finished collecting data for each of the specified triangles, I asked students to use the greater than, less than, or equal to symbols to complete the following mathematical statements about the lengths of the sides of each of their five triangles: ",24,mtms2007-08-6a,,

"Several students asked why their record sheet only had one set of statements. I responded that they could duplicate the statements for each of their triangles as needed. Students discovered very quickly that it was not necessary to duplicate the statements, because the relationships were the same for each of their triangles. The “aha”  moment was on us. We had success at last!",28,mtms2007-08-6a,,

"Use The Geometer’s Sketchpad to create a scalene triangle ABC. Use the measurement tool to measure the length of one side of the triangle and the sum of the measures of the other two sides.

The fact that I would have to schedule computer laboratory time was another consideration. Balancing the time factor with the anticipated learning outcome is always a critical consideration. I was also a bit uncomfortable using numbers other than ",30,mtms2007-08-6a,,

discussion,44,mtms2007-08-6a,,
"As I reflected on my journey to find the perfect representation, I was reminded that the use of manipulatives, models, and hands-on materials does not guarantee that students will be able to construct the desired mathematical knowledge. There is indeed no intrinsic magical power in the materials or models, but rather the power lies in the careful orchestration of the task by the teacher and thoughtful reflection by the students. This includes not only identifying a vehicle for representing the concept but also providing a structure for formatting and interpreting the data that guides students to the desired understanding or generalization. By including only one set of equations on the student record sheet, I was able to facilitate the students’ ability to make a conjecture based on their data and to guide them toward the desired generalization. Throughout the planning  process, I became keenly aware of the impact that my prior knowledge has on my ability to plan activities for my students. In the future, I will make every effort to think through the activities from my students’ perspective, unencumbered by my prior understandings. This situation will present an ongoing challenge. I realized that my quest was not about manipulatives or models but rather about deepening students’ mathematical understanding. I might even go so far as to add, “Caution: Be careful how you use manipulatives and models in your classroom; they may be hazardous to mathematical learning. Some models may lead to erroneous data and can reinforce misconceptions.”",45,mtms2007-08-6a,,
"As I search for representations that  will help my students discover a new concept for themselves or develop a deeper understanding of a mathematical idea, I will try to keep the following questions in mind: •  Does the manipulative or model  clearly and accurately represent the concept and minimize the potential for misleading data collection? •  Do the materials lend themselves to an efficient guided discovery activity that respects both the teacher’s and students’ investment of time?  •  Does the activity include a structure or recording procedure that will facilitate the students’ ability to construct the desired knowledge and guide students toward making a generalization or nudge them toward the desired symbolic  representation?
