Warshauer, Sonalee Bhattacharyya, and Christina Koehne cCalculators are often effi cient in  fi nding the answer to an addition or subtraction problem, but they do not reveal the process by which the answer is obtained. Developing students’ ﬂ uency in addition and subtraction using strategies and algorithms based on place value, composing and decomposing numbers in base 10, and reading and writing numerals in expanded form are important teaching and learning standards not only for the elementary grades but for middle school students as well (NCTM 2000; CCSSI 2010; TEA 2015). We introduced the Chinese abacus to our students as a hands-on tool to illuminate the meaning of a number in expanded form in terms of place values and to strengthen students’ conceptual understanding of the standard algorithms of addition and ",2,Abacus Interactive

This activity will let students explore the mathematical properties of the base 10 system in a creative and interactive way. Students develop a deeper meaning of why the standard algorithms work and how they relate to a number in expanded form.

4,Abacus Interactive,THE CHINESE ABACUS AND HOW IT WORKS,4,Abacus Interactive
5,Abacus Interactive,"The Chinese abacus, or suanpan, in Chinese, was fi rst described in a 190 CE book of the Eastern Han dynasty (Yoke 2000). It is a calculating tool that was in use centuries before the adoption of the modern, written numeral system, and it is still used by merchants and bookkeepers (Heffelfi nger 2010). Below we present a brief introduction on how to use the Chinese abacus for representing numbers and performing the basic arithmetic operations of addition and subtraction. A more detailed description on how to use this tool can be found at http://www.tuxgraphics .org/giniandkarlsworld/mathblog/ abacusexplained.shtml. ",5,Abacus Interactive

The abacus consists of seven beads on each vertical rod with one horizontal beam referred to as the center beam. Of the seven beads, two beads are located above the center beam and fi ve beads are located below, called the upper and lower beads, respectively. The columns (vertical rods) represent the place values of the beads. The rightmost column represents the units place, the second column from the right represents the tens place, and so forth. When a bead is moved toward the center beam, it is given a value. ",8,Abacus Interactive

14,Abacus Interactive,"Example: Add 23 + 49 center beam is worth one unit in the tens place, and each bead above the center beam is worth fi ve in the tens place. As an example, we show 67 in ﬁ gure 2.",14,Abacus Interactive
15,Abacus Interactive,"Whenever all fi ve lower beads  are moved toward the center beam, they can be substituted for one upper bead. Also, whenever all fi ve lower beads and one upper bead are moved toward the center beam on a single vertical rod, these six beads can be substituted for one lower bead on the rod to the left of the current rod. Using these steps, students may notice that the second upper bead is not necessary for counting on the abacus. In fact, a Japanese abacus, called a soroban, has only one bead above the center beam and four beads below the center beam (Heffelfi nger 2010). Therefore, when counting from four to fi ve on a Japanese abacus, the four lower beads are shifted down and an upper bead is brought toward the center beam, thus increasing the value from four to fi ve.",15,Abacus Interactive
16,Abacus Interactive,"When adding on the Chinese  abacus, we can begin on the leftmost column and move toward the right or begin on the rightmost column and move toward the left. This differs from the standard addition algorithm that requires adding from right to left. Thus, working with the abacus can increase students’ comprehension of the nature of the calculations and deepen their understanding of the ",16,Abacus Interactive

31,Abacus Interactive,IMPLEMENTING THE ACTIVITY,31,Abacus Interactive
32,Abacus Interactive,"For this activity, students will be creating their own abacuses and performing the calculations on the provided activity sheet. However, before students construct their own abacuses and receive their activity sheets, we recommend that the teacher either  project an online abacus on the board (see the above-mentioned Web resource) or create one from magnets to use on a whiteboard to provide students with examples of representing numbers, adding, and subtracting. When the authors implemented this activity, they led examples at the front of the class and then had student volunteers come up and do the motions to complete the calculations as well. This allowed students to understand the steps used in calculating on an abacus and showed them the usefulness of this tool.",32,Abacus Interactive
33,Abacus Interactive,"Next, have students construct  their own abacuses. Follow the steps on the Abacus Construction Instructions sheet provided. Examples of completed abacuses are included with the instruction sheet to assist in the process.",33,Abacus Interactive
34,Abacus Interactive,"After each student has an aba- cus, distribute the activity sheet. We recommend that you implement the activity sheet fi rst as individual student work, and then have students discuss their work in small groups. Place the emphasis on the actions required to perform the operations on the abacus, not just the fi nal answers. Then have students present their stepby-step processes in front of the class. This activity can be completed in two 90-minute class periods. Two of the authors implemented this activity at a summer math camp with a diverse set of students ranging from grades 5–7.",34,Abacus Interactive
35,Abacus Interactive,"The fi rst question on the  activity sheet should act as a review of place value that the students should have learned in a previous lesson. Questions 2–4 allow students to visualize place value and get familiar with representing numbers on their abacus to prepare for the calculations in questions 5 and 6. Question 7 should suggest to the student that the very top bead and the very bottom bead are not necessary for the calculations. At this point, the teacher can bring up the Japanese version of the abacus, which has four lower beads and only one upper bead. Question 8 calls students’ attention to the connections between how they would perform arithmetic operations on paper versus on the abacus. This will allow students to make more sense of the mechanics behind standard algorithms.",35,Abacus Interactive
36,Abacus Interactive,"The goal of the extension is to introduce the base 5 numeration system without explicitly using the powers of 5 as the place values. Students should be able to follow similar steps to those used on their base 10 abacuses to represent numbers in base 5. We leave it to the teacher to extend the activity further by having students add or  subtract numbers in base 5, convert numbers between base 10 and base 5, or introduce other bases. ",36,Abacus Interactive
37,Abacus Interactive,CONCLUSION,37,Abacus Interactive
38,Abacus Interactive,"In this activity, students have an opportunity to explore the use of the Chinese abacus, an ancient calculation tool. There is value in creating and learning about a historical tool that is still commonly used in China, Japan, and other Asian countries. This activity allows students to develop a deeper understanding of place value by repeatedly decomposing numbers into expanded form, recording them on their abacus, and translating numbers off the abacus. Instead of learning by rote, when students manipulate an abacus, they can visualize and make sense of the operations so that the meaning behind the algorithm becomes clear.",38,Abacus Interactive
