0,The Lottery Is a Mathematics Powerball - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Lottery games present an ideal context for classroom mathematical exploration. Many ideas about how to use the lottery in mathematics classes have been well explored (e.g., Crites 1994; Vest 1993), especially in NCTM school journals (see the list of resources). Here, we expand on ideas presented by Rubel (2005/2013) and present new and innovative classroom approaches that we have used in our project, Local Lotto, to explore mathematics through lottery games.",,

2,The Lottery Is a Mathematics Powerball - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"A straight bet in roulette is an example of a game that involves choosing k distinct numbers out of a set of n possibilities: In this case, a player chooses 1 number out of 38 possible numbers in hopes that this choice will match the winning number. Students can be introduced to this game through simulations, using a website like http://www.math.uah.edu/stat/apps/RouletteExperiment.html or using an actual, inexpensive roulette wheel. The goal of this introductory activity is for students to build an understanding that their selected number has a 1/38 chance of being the winning number.",,
3,The Lottery Is a Mathematics Powerball - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"To extend students mathematical reasoning, we have students play a modified lottery game that we call Color Pick. In this game, a player chooses 3 different colors out of a set of five colors. To win, the players 3 colors on their ticket must match the three winning colors, in any order. Students are quickly confronted with comparing Color Pick to straight-bet roulette. In that game, the player made a single selection out of 38 choices (k = 1, n = 38), and the chances of winning were 1 out of 38. Now the player has three selections out of a menu of five options (k = 3, n = 5).",,
4,The Lottery Is a Mathematics Powerball - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In our experience using Color Pick in the classroom, we have found that many students erroneously respond that the chances of winning this game are 3/5. After all, we are choosing 3 colors from a set of 5 colors, which suggests to students that the chances of winning are 3 out of 5 as well. Once students play Color Pick several times and tally the total frequency of wins, they realize that this initial estimate of 3/5 is too high. Confronted with a conflict between their estimates of 3/5 and empirical probabilities that are much smaller, students begin to reckon with how Color Pick differs from straight-bet roulette. This introduces the need to consider permutations and combinations of colors.",,
5,The Lottery Is a Mathematics Powerball - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,COLOR PICK TREE DIAGRAM: COUNTING PERMUTATIONS,,
6,The Lottery Is a Mathematics Powerball - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Playing Color Pick and understanding how it is different from roulette can be shown using a model that illustrates the possible combinations of colors. Instead of beginning with an abstract tree diagram, we suggest using a physical paper model containing branches and leaves to model Color Pick.",,
7,The Lottery Is a Mathematics Powerball - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The students can work in groups, with each group taking a different color with which to begin the branch. At the ends of each branch are leaves that represent a unique permutation of 3 colors. The branch in figure 1 models the permutations of 3 colors that can result when the first pick is yellow.",,
8,The Lottery Is a Mathematics Powerball - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
9,The Lottery Is a Mathematics Powerball - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"For example, the leaf at the top is yellow-green-blue, and there are 12 different leaves for the part of the tree that begins with yellow. The 5 corresponding parts of the tree from the groups in the class can be aggregated to create one complete, class tree that contains all 60 permutations. Students can see that for each of the 5 possible color options for the first branch, there are 4  3 arrangements of the colors, leading to a total of 5  4  3 arrangements (see fig. 2).",,
10,The Lottery Is a Mathematics Powerball - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
11,The Lottery Is a Mathematics Powerball - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"When students systematically list the 60 possible arrangements of 3 colors in a tree diagram, with actual tangible branches and leaves to represent each arrangement, they are literally constructing the concept of a permutation.",,
12,The Lottery Is a Mathematics Powerball - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,COLOR PICK TREE DIAGRAM: FROM PERMUTATIONS TO COMBINATIONS,,
13,The Lottery Is a Mathematics Powerball - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"With the class tree model as a visual resource for students, the teacher can run another simulation of the Color Pick game. Suppose the winning colors are yellow, green, and blue. Students search in the class tree to find all the leaves that match this combination. When they realize that 6 of the leaves have this combination, they can physically regroup the 60 distinct permutations into 10 combination groups of 6 permutations (see fig. 3). Students can apply the same counting principles to figure out that there are 6 permutations for each color combination: there are 3 color choices for the first spot on the leaf, and for each of these there are 2 colors that can be chosen for the second spot (3  2), leaving just one color choice for the final spot, for a total of 3  2  1, or 6, permutations.",,
14,The Lottery Is a Mathematics Powerball - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
15,The Lottery Is a Mathematics Powerball - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Finally, students can use the collection of leaves from the model in two different ways to figure out the probability of winning the Color Pick game. One approach is to reason that there are 6 possible color leaves, or permutations, for any color combination. This means that the probability of winning the game is 6/60 because there are 6 permutations of the winning combination, out of a total of 60 permutations. A second way is to reason that there are 10 different, equally represented combinations of colors and one winning combination, which means that the probability of winning is, equivalently, 1/10. This physical tree model supports students in developing an initial understanding of permutations, combinations, and probability, and how the three concepts are related. In our experience, this model is accessible to students and encourages their participation in that they are physically building the model as well as interpreting it.",,
16,The Lottery Is a Mathematics Powerball - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"After reasoning about Color Pick, students are ready to consider winning the jackpot in one of their states lottery games. For instance, in New Yorks Sweet Million lottery, a player chooses 6 different numbers from 1 to 40 and wins the jackpot by matching all 6 of the winning numbers. Again, many students initially reason that the probability of winning this game would be 6/40 because a player is choosing 6 out of 40 numbers. However, after problem solving with and about the Color Pick game, students are ready to go from the colorful tree model to an abstraction of a similar tree model for the larger Sweet Million game. Students can use the Color Pick tree to support their visualization of the structure of a similar tree for the Sweet Million game. A tree representing the permutations and combinations in the Sweet Million game would have",,
17,The Lottery Is a Mathematics Powerball - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"40  39  38  37  36  35 leaves,",,
18,The Lottery Is a Mathematics Powerball - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"or permutations, of 6 numbers. Each combination would be expressed on",,
19,The Lottery Is a Mathematics Powerball - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,6  5  4  3  2  1 different leaves.,,
20,The Lottery Is a Mathematics Powerball - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In other words, any ticket has a",,
21,The Lottery Is a Mathematics Powerball - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
22,The Lottery Is a Mathematics Powerball - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"or a 1 in nearly 4 million, chance of winning the jackpot prize.",,
23,The Lottery Is a Mathematics Powerball - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,MAKING SENSE OF PROBABILITY IN THE REAL WORLD: SCALING,,
24,The Lottery Is a Mathematics Powerball - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Lottery games quickly generate very large numbers, in terms of analyzing possible permutations and combinations. Lottery games can also generate very small numbers, in terms of the probability of winning. Numbers of large and small magnitudes can be difficult for students to relate to. Therefore, exercises in scaling can support students in translating large, unwieldy numbers or unfathomably small probabilities into concrete, tangible, or familiar representations.",,
25,The Lottery Is a Mathematics Powerball - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In analyzing the Sweet Million game, which had approximately 4 million different combinations, students can scale 4 million in terms of familiar objects, processes, or even local landmarks. For example, if you took 4 million steps due north from where you are standing right now, where would you be? How far would you have to walk to burn 4 million calories? What do 4 million dots look like? How tall would a stack of 4 million pennies be? Using this last question, we found that since a penny is approximately 1.52 mm thick, stacking 4 million pennies would result in a stack about 6,080,000 mm, or 6,080 m high. Since the Empire State Building is about 443 m tall, that means a stack of 4 million pennies is the equivalent of 6,080  443, or almost 14 buildings in height! The probability of winning the Sweet Million lottery, therefore, is analogous to choosing the winning penny out of a stack of pennies that reach as high as 14 Empire State Buildings. In our experience with this particular example, the retention of this scaling idea has been long lasting. Two years later, Shookhoffs students still refer to winning the lottery like 1 penny out of so many Empire State Buildings.",,
26,The Lottery Is a Mathematics Powerball - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,USING MATH TO ANALYZE AND CRITIQUE LOTTERY ADS,,
27,The Lottery Is a Mathematics Powerball - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Students can apply mathematics to analyze, understand, and critique the widely available and well-known lottery advertisements in their own state. Students can talk back to the mathematics in the official advertisements with their own posters. Figure 4 shows a sample poster titled Hey Now You Know, a response to the New York Lotterys slogan, Hey, You Never Know. In the poster, students use mathematics and other facts about the Take 5 lottery to make the probability of winning visible and convey the idea that winning is not as easy as portrayed by advertisements.",,
28,The Lottery Is a Mathematics Powerball - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
29,The Lottery Is a Mathematics Powerball - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,ANALYZING LOTTERY DATA: FURTHER POSSIBILITIES,,
30,The Lottery Is a Mathematics Powerball - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Since lotteries are run by state governmental agencies, states collect data about lottery transactions and will provide these data to citizens. Data on lottery transactions can be requested by anyone with a Freedom of Information Act request to obtain data about where lottery tickets are sold, with what frequency, and where prize money is won. These data can be used to analyze the lottery and its impact on specific neighborhoods or cities. Mapping software can be used to represent the geospatial distribution of the lottery retailer locations to help students see patterns or form conjectures. Readers might be interested in viewing an example of such a map, which specifies the locations of lottery retailers in New York City as well as their net revenues and prize amounts for 2010 (see fig. 5). Spatial analyses of the lottery, like this one, provide additional opportunities for students to use mathematics that connects to distributions, such as ratio and proportion.",,
31,The Lottery Is a Mathematics Powerball - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Aside from public data sets, teachers can organize activities for students to consider, gather, and analyze the presence of the lottery in their immediate surroundings (in the forty-four states in the United States that allow lotteries). For example, students can investigate the schools neighborhood and create a map showing where lottery tickets are sold and conduct interviews with retailers about lottery spending in particular stores. Similarly, students can interview people in the neighborhood or adults in their families about their lottery spending choices and reasoning (see Lim et al. 2015).",,
32,The Lottery Is a Mathematics Powerball - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,LOTTERY MATH IS A GAME CHANGER,,
33,The Lottery Is a Mathematics Powerball - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"A context like the lottery can be a source of productive tension for teachers. In reflecting about his teaching with Local Lotto, Sullivan wrestled with whether mathematics was being used to support a deep study of the lottery or whether the lottery was being used to motivate the learning of mathematics. This very tension exemplifies why the lottery is such an exciting topic to work with because it accomplishes both! The lottery has rich potential for mathematical explorations. It serves as a real-world context to explore concepts of permutations, combinations, sample space, and probability in terms of making sense of the lottery games. The lottery offers additional possibilities in terms of scaling, data analysis, and spatial analysis. Finally, by readily connecting to issues of social justice, the lottery offers opportunities to invite students to look critically at their world through the lens of mathematics. The lottery is truly a mathematics powerball!",,
