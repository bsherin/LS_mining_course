"curricula standards maintain that learning is optimized when students are actively involved in the learning process by assimilating information and constructing their own meanings. Our experience with teaching probability concepts has shown that students struggle with concepts of counting. These struggles affect students’ ability to find sample spaces and probability. In particular, students have difficulty making sense of permutations and combinations. They often have trouble with the meanings of these concepts, with their relationships, and how and when to use each concept.",5,mtms2013-03-430a,,
"We have found that students lack  the conceptual understanding necessary to succeed in making sense of these ideas. Our observations of students’ struggles with counting concepts are consistent with what others have identified (e.g., Annin and Lai  2010; Sriraman and English 2004). To combat this lack of foundational understanding, we use a studentcentered problem-solving approach to engage sixth-grade students in making sense of counting problems. We share how we teach the fundamental counting principle (FCP) and use it as a crosscutting and unifying theme for all other counting concepts. ",6,mtms2013-03-430a,,

"We focus on the fundamental counting principle (FCP). We do not merely describe the FCP to students and let them loose. Instead, we give students time to explore problems in small groups. We begin by asking students to solve counting problems that use multiplication and build on this experience to introduce other concepts. One way to introduce students to the FCP is through the Coin and Die problem:  Toss a coin, then roll a six-sided die. What are the possible outcomes of this experiment? How many possibilities are there?",12,mtms2013-03-430a,,
"For each problem we give to  students, we insist on asking for a count of the possibilities and a list of the possibilities. Although a typical textbook problem might ask for the number of possibilities only, we want students to become proficient with  listing all possible outcomes as well. We found that this benefits students when they must make decisions about order in sample spaces and probability. Most students begin solving the Coin and Die problem by creating lists that pair each coin possibility to a die possibility to create possible outcomes. ",13,mtms2013-03-430a,,
"We monitor students’ progress by asking, “How do you know you have listed and counted all the possibilities?” This question encourages students to make an organized list to ensure that they have indeed exhausted all possibilities. Some groups need further assistance so we suggest they create a grid similar to that shown in table 1. ",14,mtms2013-03-430a,,
After solving a few tasks like the ,15,mtms2013-03-430a,,
"Coin and Die problem, students often notice a pattern: The total number of possibilities is related to the number of outcomes for each step of the task. They discover that the total number of possibilities in each problem is equal to the product of the number of outcomes for each of the steps. To help students generalize this pattern to other situations, we present problems  involving more than two steps, such as the Ice-Cream Cone problem.   A vendor sells vanilla and chocolate ice cream. Customers can choose from a waffle cone or a sugar cone. For toppings, hot fudge and caramel are available. Determine the sample space for all possible orders that a customer can place of one scoop of ice cream in a cone with one topping. How many possible orders are there?",16,mtms2013-03-430a,,
"This problem helps students realize  that they cannot simply construct a table, as in the case of the Coin and Die problem. Students try various problemsolving approaches, such as expressing all the possibilities for the ice cream and cone only, in a table. Then, they match those results using a second table with the possibilities for a topping. At this point, we present a tree-diagram representation to give students another problem-solving tool (see fig. 1).",17,mtms2013-03-430a,,
"As in the case of the two-step  problems, students are able to  conjecture that the total number of  possibilities is the product of the possibilities for each step. At this point, we help formalize students’ conjectures by presenting this explanation of the inner workings of the FCP:   If there are m ways of doing something and n ways of doing another thing, then there are m × n ways of performing both actions.",18,mtms2013-03-430a,,
This explanation can be extended to any number of actions.,19,mtms2013-03-430a,,
"In addition to explicitly presenting  the FCP, we also model writing the number of possibilities: ",20,mtms2013-03-430a,,
Number of possible orders  =     2       ×      2        ×      2    Possible        Possible         Possible     no. of           no. of             no. of     flavors          cones             toppings = 8,21,mtms2013-03-430a,,
We then show the students how each of these numbers on the FCP can be seen on their tree diagram. ,22,mtms2013-03-430a,,
"One of the first indicators of student success is their ability to identify how the number of steps, or selections, comprise a problem. For example, we asked students to determine how many five-digit numbers are possible if the digits cannot be repeated. More than half the class sketched five slots to represent the number of possibilities for each digit on a five-digit number. When a student was asked to share her reasoning for the five slots, she stated that there are five digits to be chosen. Once we reached a class consensus about the number of slots, students worked to complete the problem. Some students struggled with filling their slots with the correct number of possibilities, and provided calculations such as 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6, so we asked a guiding question: “Is 05687 a possible five-digit number?”  a student maps out the possible outcomes to the coin and die problem.",23,mtms2013-03-430a,,
"After determining that zero was not a possibility for the first slot, students then wrote 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5.",24,mtms2013-03-430a,,
"At this point, we asked students to use digit cards to determine the number of possibilities for each slot. Students then wrote the correct solution of 9 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6.",25,mtms2013-03-430a,,
We believe that introducing the ,26,mtms2013-03-430a,,
"FCP before other concepts establishes the necessary foundation for understanding permutations and combinations. When students discover the FCP for themselves, they make valuable connections between concepts.

"Using the students’ understanding of the FCP, we transition to permutations. Again, we do not begin by merely presenting students with the formulas for permutations. Instead, we give students opportunities to create patterns through problem solving by  introducing the Class Presentation problem:   Suppose each of three students needs to give a class presentation. In how many different ways can they order their presentations?",29,mtms2013-03-430a,,
"Since there is an aspect of ordering, which is featured for the first time in these types of explorations, we use Unifix® cubes to help students model the meaning of ordering (see fig. 2). To ensure that students grasp the meaning of order, we ask these typical questions:  1.  How does the first arrangement   differ from the second arrangement? 2.  Have we exhausted the possibilities? 3.  In how many ways can you order  the presentations?",30,mtms2013-03-430a,,

"Although it would be quicker to give students a formula for permutations, we believe it is better for students to create these formulas on their own.

"This solution is in stark contrast to asking students to merely apply a formula that may have no meaning to them. In each of the problems that involved arranging a subset, we intentionally asked, “Why are we not multiplying all the way down to one?” Initially, students struggled to respond to this question. However, by the third problem, they were quick to give such responses as “Because we only need to arrange two.” These two types of problems—one involving the ordering of all the elements and another ordering a subset of all the available elements— are distinguished as permutations and factorials, respectively (see fi g. 5).",46,mtms2013-03-430a,,

"We ask students to model all the possible ways of telling the cashier at the pizza parlor what two-topping pizza they want (see fi g. 7a). Then, we use this modeling to help students make decisions about order by asking the following questions to promote discussion: 1.  How many ways are possible for  stating the type of pizza you want? 2.  If you ordered a pepperoni-and- onion pizza and your friend ordered an onion-and-pepperoni pizza, would the pizzas be different? 3.

"Our goal for this extension is to have students determine the number of ways of stating any three-topping pizza so that they can determine what the denominator should be. We help students recall that there are 5 × 4 × 3 ways of stating any threetopping selection. This reinforces what students did with the FPC and permutations.
