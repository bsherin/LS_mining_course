2,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (August 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","An introductory chapter describes the historical context of the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSM) as well as the authorâ€™s definition of exemplary mathematics teaching in reform-based classrooms. The chapters that follow illustrate effective applications of the CCSSMâ€™s standards. For example, chapter 11 documents the implementation of the lesson study process.",,
3,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (August 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Other chapters contain a description of a unit of learning and provide an explanation of mathematical tasks, which are then followed by a discussion between colleagues and a unit overview. Transcripts of classroom talk are included, along with resources.",,
4,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (August 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics",This book is for mathematics educators. The resources at the end of each chapter can be used immediately. Both the content and presentation of the material are appropriate for the intended audience.,,
5,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (August 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics",I worked with two sixth-grade teachers who implemented the proportional reasoning resources to develop studentsâ€™ conceptual understanding of ratios and proportions. Test results showed that their students had developed a stronger conceptual understanding than found when using other items.,,
6,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (August 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics",This book is a valuable resource. It provides support for teachers making the big shifts in teaching that CCSSM requires. The transcripts and examples present a clear visual of the teachersâ€™ instructional moves and how students can develop a deep level of conceptual understanding. The practical resources ease the implementation of the tasks.,,
7,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (August 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics",Mathematics educators will benefit from this book as they work to provide reform-based mathematics instruction. The lesson study described in the last chapter can be replicated and used with professional learning communities.,,

11,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (August 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","David A. Sousa, 2015. 256 pp.,$39.95 paper. ISBN 978â€‘1â€‘4833â€‘ 6846â€‘7. Corwin Publishers; www.corwin.com.",,
12,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (August 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","In How the Brain Learns Mathematics, David A. Sousa links findings from neuroscience and cognitive psychology to teaching and learning mathematics. Drawing on brain-imaging technology that has allowed researchers to see what parts of the brain are active when people count, compute, and solve mathematical tasks, he offers insights into why certain teaching strategies may, or may not, be effective.",,
13,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (August 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","After discussing why early humans developed number sense and processes involved in learning to calculate, Sousa presents an overview of key elements of learning, including memory, feedback, formative assessment, and motivation. Subsequent chapters are organized by developmental stages: preschool and kindergarten, preadolescence, and adolescence. Sousa highlights aspects of brain development that are unique to each stage and suggests mathematics teaching strategies tailored to the stage under discussion. Understanding and addressing difficulties that students may face when learning mathematics is also addressed.",,
14,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (August 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Sousaâ€™s text is engaging and informative. His research synthesis helps readers understand why it is important to use particular teaching strategies, such as group work and whole-class discussion, and conversely, why other approaches like teacher-demonstrated algorithms followed by lengthy activity sheets may be detrimental. Occasionally, suggestions for classroom practice are problematic (e.g., the â€œcue wordsâ€ strategy for understanding word problems). However, considering Sousaâ€™s obvious commitment to teaching mathematics for understanding, these are not fatal flaws.",,
15,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (August 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Classroom teachers, administrators, and math coaches will appreciate the research-based explanations for why mathematics instruction that focuses on meaning making, connections, and processes is so important.",,

18,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (August 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Anne Collins and Linda Dacey, 2014. 98 pp., $18.00 paper. ISBN 978â€‘1â€‘57110â€‘982â€‘8. Stenhouse Publishers; www.stenhouse.com.",,
19,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (August 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Itâ€™s All Relative is a spiral-bound resource that contains over forty different activities and thirty teaching modules to help students understand ratio and proportional relationships that are aligned with the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics. The activities vary from hands-on activities, such as recording the number of squats that students can complete in thirty seconds and comparing it with the number of hops in thirty seconds, to real-world applications in which students compare shopping prices on camping supplies. The activities in the appendix include an extensive answer key with additional explanations if needed.",,
20,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (August 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","This book would be a great asset not only for its plentiful student activities but also for professional learning communities. Thirty modules are categorized into representing ratios, unit and scale factors, and percentages. Each module is aligned with a standard, followed by possible challenges and misconceptions. Suggestions are given on ways to help with such challenges and misconceptions and ways to differentiate instruction. Activities to complete in the classroom and references for further reading are also included.",,
21,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (August 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","I would recommend this book because it contains clear, precise language; explanations; and visual models (tables, tape diagrams, graphs, and double number lines) that teachers can use to help students understand ratio and proportions. Although it has thirty modules and many student activities, it is not overwhelming.",,
22,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (August 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","On a personal note, this book made me understand why I was taught to cross multiply. It was something in middle and high school that I completed haphazardly without a clear outstanding. Now, thanks to this book, I understand why.",,

26,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (August 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Response to Intervention (RtI) is for all students. RtI in Math: Evidence-Based Interventions for Struggling Students gives teachers a clear understanding of the entire RtI process, beginning with identifying and grouping students; increasing motivation with an effective incentive program while not breaking the bank; and moving students from concrete/manipulative representations to abstract and problem-solving skills that work within the topics of place value, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, fractions, rational numbers, decimals, and percentages, and within contextual problems.",,
27,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (August 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","I have used several of the explicit instruction lessons given in the book. My students have made gains in addition and subtraction because we went back to the concrete stages of place value in concrete representation and moved forward to multidigit addition and subtraction with the use of base ten blocks. RtI in Math provides ready-to-use lessons of explicit instruction; explores multiple strategies for building a concept; and uncovers resources available on the Internet for lessons, videos, and more. This book helps teachers meet students where their â€œgapâ€ skills are most evident. It also explains how to help students keep trying until they master skills that they have been struggling with. In so doing, these students will be able to move forward with confidence that they can master math.",,
28,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (August 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics",I believe this book is an excellent resource for any teacher involved in RtI tier 2 or tier 3 instruction.,,

32,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (August 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics",This book may be used to help motivate middle school girls who see little or no connection between their lives and the mathematics that they are learning in school. The book provides numerous real-life scenarios that explore how a working knowledge of basic mathematics is needed to make smart decisions in a middle school girlâ€™s life.,,
33,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (August 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","The text is divided into the four chapters of â€œFractionsâ€; â€œDecimalsâ€; â€œArea, Perimeter and Volumeâ€; and â€œGraphs and Charts.â€ This book is definitely not a crash course in teaching the math processes used in solving real-life problems, especially as found in the fraction chapter. However it does demonstrate, with minimal explanations, how to apply basic middle school mathematics in everyday life.",,
34,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (August 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","The examples are appropriate and engaging for the intended audience. Photographs of girls of multiple ethnicities doing math help engage the reader. At the end of each chapter, three to four additional problems are posed, and the answers are supplied at the back of the book. A glossary is also included. An excellent interview with a career woman provides insight into how girls will use the math that they are currently studying in future jobs.",,
35,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (August 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","The biggest weakness is that the book is not what the title suggests. Although it does â€œshow the workâ€ for each problem, there is often not enough explanation for a student to understand and learn the process being used. It also assumes that readers know that 15 minutes is equal to 1/4 hour and other similar equivalents. One major mathematical error is stating that .33 is equal to 1/3, which is not only incorrect but also a major mistake that middle school students make. The book also states that a trapezoid is a quadrilateral with one pair of opposite sides parallel. This definition could be confusing to a middle schooler who is more familiar with the alternative inclusive definition: Trapezoids have at least one pair of opposite sides parallel.",,
36,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (August 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Nonetheless, this book would make a nice addition to a classroom or school library to show young girls the immediate necessity of learning mathematics.",,
