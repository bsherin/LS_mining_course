0,Spaghetti Bridges_ Modeling Linear Relationships - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Mathematics and science are natural partners. One of many examples of this partnership occurs when scientific observations are made, thus providing data that can be used for mathematical modeling. Developing mathematical relationships elucidates such scientific principles. This activity describes a data-collection activity in which students employ the scientific method to explore the relationship between the number of spaghetti strands making a â€œbridgeâ€ and the weight that the bridge can support. Students will make qualitative predictions about relationships between variables and write linear equations to represent their data.",,
1,Spaghetti Bridges_ Modeling Linear Relationships - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"This activity builds connections between many of the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSM). Students construct and interpret scatterplots for bivariate data and investigate patterns of association; investigate linear models, informally fit a straight line, and assess the model fit by judging the closeness of the data points to the line; and connect a physical model to a function to interpret slope and y-intercept in terms of the situation it models and in terms of its graph.",,
2,Spaghetti Bridges_ Modeling Linear Relationships - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"As students plan and conduct their experiment, they are also developingproficiency with the Standards for Mathematical Practice (SMP). The focus of the activity is modeling with mathematics. Students also make sense of problems and persevere in solving them. Analyzing the data provides practice with abstract and quantitative reasoning, and reflecting on and writing about the activity provide practice in communicating, reasoning, and constructing viable arguments.",,
3,Spaghetti Bridges_ Modeling Linear Relationships - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,The data-collection activity requires minimal setup (see fig. 1).,,

5,Spaghetti Bridges_ Modeling Linear Relationships - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Before class, poke two holes near the rim of a plastic cup; using the heated end of a hot-glue gun works well. Tie a short length of string through the holes. Materials needed for a class of twenty include the following:",,
6,Spaghetti Bridges_ Modeling Linear Relationships - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Demonstrate the experimental procedure by using a single strand of spaghetti to suspend the cup between two tables or chairs (see fig. 2).,,
7,Spaghetti Bridges_ Modeling Linear Relationships - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
8,Spaghetti Bridges_ Modeling Linear Relationships - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Try to keep the cup in the center of the span. The supports (tables or chairs) should be the same height. Gently place uniform weights into the cup, one at a time, while students observe. Pause when the spaghetti breaks and ask, â€œWhat did you see?â€ and â€œWhat could be changed?â€ Encourage discussion of further investigation by asking, â€œWhat can we measure?â€ and â€œWhat would be worthwhile to investigate?â€",,
9,Spaghetti Bridges_ Modeling Linear Relationships - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Suggest (if necessary) that the bridge-design factor of interest is the number of spaghetti strands. This number will determine how many weights can be supported; therefore, it is the independent variable. The number of weights supported is the dependent variable (responding to change). Other variables should be controlled (not change.) Provide a few minutes for students to collaboratively plan their experiment (see activity sheet 1). Students must agree on when the spaghetti has broken. Sometimes a slight time delay occurs between addition of the weight and breakage. Instruct students to record the last number of weights actually supported by the bridge.",,
10,Spaghetti Bridges_ Modeling Linear Relationships - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"As student groups conduct their experiments and collect data, the teacher should circulate and ask, â€œWhat variables are you controlling? Why?â€ Asking such questions will help build studentsâ€™ conceptual understanding. Others include, â€œAre the results what you expected?â€ and â€œDoes there appear to be a relationship between number of strands of spaghetti and strength of the bridge? How do you know?â€ Once data are collected, students use activity sheet 2 to create a scatterplot to display their groupâ€™s results and estimate a line of best fit (see fig. 3).",,

12,Spaghetti Bridges_ Modeling Linear Relationships - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The concept of linear association is a fundamental topic in algebra. As students analyze their data, they will be gaining experience with important algebra topics. Depending on studentsâ€™ level, the teacher may review fundamental concepts of scatterplot construction, such as using consistent spacing, labeling axes, adding a title, and other elements. It may also be necessary to review critical algebra concepts, such as slope and y-intercept. As students write an equation in slope-intercept form, they should be encouraged to consider the meaning of the slope (number of weights supported per strand of spaghetti) and y-intercept (weight of the empty cup). This model of linear association will be used to discuss independent, dependent, and control variables, as well as to identify a line of fit and write linear equations. Reviewing studentsâ€™ written work will uncover misconceptions and topics that should be addressed to ensure student understanding (see figs. 4a, 4b, and 5).",,

15,Spaghetti Bridges_ Modeling Linear Relationships - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"This lesson actively engages students in the collection and analysis of data. The opening demonstration creates a â€œhookâ€ for students at the beginning of the lesson as well as modeling the method of data collection. The linear model developed will be used multiple times to discuss independent, dependent, and control variables. When students write an equation in slope-intercept form to represent their results, they can refer to the physical model as they strengthen their understanding of slope (rate of change) and y-intercept (initial value). Building connections between math and science enhances studentsâ€™ learning in both areas.",,
