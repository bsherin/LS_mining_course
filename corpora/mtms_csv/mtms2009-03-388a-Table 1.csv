"From Kinesthetic  Movement to  Algebraic Functions aAre students able to work through a  series of geometric spatial activities, discover a pattern, and find an algebraic function? Can they move from using spatial intelligence to number sense to algebraic reasoning? Are they able to connect geometric thinking and algebra, physical models, and numeric relationships? Friel, Rachlin, and Doyle (2001) state, “Explorations that develop from problems that can be solved by using tables, graphs, verbal descriptions, concrete or pictorial representations or algebraic symbols offer opportunities for students to build their understandings of mathematical functions” (p. v). Further, combining physical spatial activities with algebraic reasoning can better engage beginning algebra students in the task at hand. According to Jensen (2001), the kinesthetic arts can provide a significant vehicle that can enhance content-area learning.  the task: staR PatteRns",2,mtms2009-03-388a,,
"To provide insight into the questions posed above, I asked a beginning algebra 1 class to participate in an activity that involved their kinesthetic and logical mathematical intelligences (Gardner 1993). Twenty-five ninth graders were placed in groups of five, and each group was asked to form a five-pointed star with their bodies. In other words, each student had to become one point of the star, with one student acting as the top, or head, of the star.",3,mtms2009-03-388a,,
"Each group was given a beanbag and asked to find a way to toss the beanbag clockwise along the imaginary line segments connecting the points of the star (see a student’s drawing of a star in fig. 1). Students needed to determine who to toss the beanbag to and who to receive it from. After tossing and catching the beanbags a number of times, the groups were ",4,mtms2009-03-388a,,

"given yarn to use to trace the path of the beanbag tosses that represented the line segments forming the star. Once students created their yarn  stars, I had them re-form into groups of seven students and repeat the activity. This time, instead of a five-point star, the goal was to form a sevenpoint star. I asked them to compare a new pattern with the previous one. In other words, who would they toss their beanbag to and who would they receive it from? Would they continue to skip one person in the process? After some discussion, each group performed the task of creating a seven-point star and also used yarn to follow the path of their tossed beanbags to help further visualize the pattern of the seven-point star.

"Students used yarn to follow the path of their tossed beanbags to help them visualize the pattern of the seven-point star make nine-point stars, determine the pattern, toss the beanbags, and recreate the star with yarn. After all groups had formed nine-point stars, students completed the first three rows of table 1 as a class. The table column titled “People in Between” refers to the number of people who were skipped clockwise in the student-to-student tosses of the beanbags.",10,mtms2009-03-388a,,

"All students were able to form the stars with their classmates; toss and catch the beanbags; and recreate the five-, seven-, and nine-point stars using yarn. They could easily fill in the top part of table 1. However, when asked to find a solution strategy to complete the rows for the larger values at the bottom, a variety of methods emerged. Out of sixteen responses, only two groups were able to complete the chart correctly. ",13,mtms2009-03-388a,,

"Points on the  star 371 fig. 2 Example of student work from table 2 (a) (b) (c) used numeric approaches, many falling back on poor strategies, such as “When in doubt, add” or “When in doubt, perform random computations and see if something emerges.” One pair of students divided 225 by 5, then added the 45 to 225 to get 270 as an answer. Three other pairs also divided 225 by 5, then multiplied 13 by 45 to get an answer of 585. These groups were working with the numbers visible to them at the end of the completed section, as well as the two numbers provided at the bottom of table 1. One group started with the two large numbers given in the table: 225 and 371. Their work is represented in figure 2a. ",17,mtms2009-03-388a,,
Students’ responses that can be classified as algebraic thinking appeared to represent either prealgebraic or algebraic reasoning. Those who used prealgebraic strategies recognized and extended the pattern given in the table but did not complete the task (see fig. 2b). Patterning is an important component of algebraic thinking. It appears as one of the expectations in the Algebra Standard for students in grades 3−5 (NCTM 2000).,18,mtms2009-03-388a,,
Students in one of the two groups  who found the correct answer reported that they filled in the chart by “playing with numbers.” Their strategy was as follows: ,19,mtms2009-03-388a,,
"Take 225, subtract 5 [220], multiply by 2 [440], and add 13 [453]. ",20,mtms2009-03-388a,,
"This is the correct answer for the first “Points on Star” blank at the bottom of the table. Working backward, students found the second empty cell in the table. At first glance, these students were only using number sense to find their solution; however, on closer examination, they were using a recursive method. Had they extended their thinking and persisted, they may have found the explicit rule, or function. Friel, Rachlin, and Doyle ",21,mtms2009-03-388a,,
"Teachers can increase student understanding and ability to generalize algebraic rules by providing time and multiple experiences (2001) state that in a recursive form of pattern recognition, students find the rate of change from one element to the next: ",22,mtms2009-03-388a,,
"Observing how patterns change from one element to the next and then  using a recursive strategy is often easier for students than defining an explicit rule for the pattern. (p. 11)  The two girls who found the explicit rule for the pattern were able to go from the recursive form of pattern generalization to the actual formula. The formula they found was (x • 2) + 3, and their explanation is shown in figure 2c. ",23,mtms2009-03-388a,,
"After these girls displayed their  answer on the overhead projector and explained their formula to the rest of the class, all students were able to perform the steps needed to solve the equation and fill in the two blanks for the largest values in the table. To check the solutions, we extended the pattern to a few more numbers to see if the solution still worked. Procedural understanding of a problem or task is generally easier for students than generating a specific rule or formula to describe the task, but is, of course, less mathematically powerful. It is troubling, however, that the rest of the class accepted their classmates’ solution without question and that girls were asked by the teacher, rather than classmates, to check the solution by extending the pattern. Just as the solutions in figures 2a and 2b are all too typical, so is the fact that once an answer was reached, everyone seemed  relieved and felt satisfied that they completed the problem successfully.",24,mtms2009-03-388a,,

"Beginning algebra 1 students often lack the much-needed skill of recognizing a pattern or relationship then finding the rule or formula that describes this relationship. The activity described in this article is one way to assess whether students can perform this type of task. Teachers can increase student understanding and ability to generalize algebraic rules by providing time and multiple experiences working with patterns, variables, and functions. Friel, Rachlin, and Doyle (2001) suggest offering students a variety of contexts in which they— •  find the first few terms in a sequence and record them in a chart; •  describe the next shape in the  sequence; •  describe the shapes succinctly in  words; •  write a rule that will produce the  growing sequence (either recursive or explicit); •  generalize to make predictions for the 25th, 44th, or nth term in the sequence; and •  compare different ways of finding  the generalization.

"According to Reys et al. (2007),  national assessments show that many American students have difficulty with problems that require analytical thinking. Encouraging them to perform problems such as the one  described here fosters much-needed growth in higher-order thinking skills. Although a few students in this algebra 1 class were able to generalize and find the explicit formula for the spatial task, most could not, indicating that they need more time and experience with such problems. ",27,mtms2009-03-388a,,
"Having students explore geometric spatial problems and generalize to find patterns, relationships, and functions are worthwhile tasks for middle-grades students and beyond. The problem presented in this article is one such idea to help increase students’ algebraic understanding and reasoning. ",28,mtms2009-03-388a,,
