5,Back-to-School Puzzlers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,2. a. Jason dropped 44 pencils. What fraction of the pencils did not land on or touch the paper showing the letter D?,,

9,Back-to-School Puzzlers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"4. Because the pencils had been dropped, Jason is charged only $0.09 for the two pencils. He receives 8 coins in change for $1.00. What coins did he receive?",,
10,Back-to-School Puzzlers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,5. A pencil costs $1.00 more than an eraser. Together they cost $1.10. How much does the eraser cost?,,
11,Back-to-School Puzzlers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,6. A student concludes that there are only 6 days of school during a 365-day year: â,,

14,Back-to-School Puzzlers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"2. a. 38/44, or 19/22",,
15,Back-to-School Puzzlers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,b. 2.5 times as many pencils; 5 pencils touch B; 2 pencils touch A,,
16,Back-to-School Puzzlers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,3. a.Sample answer: The correct answer to Marcusâ,,

19,Back-to-School Puzzlers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Therefore, x = 220 pencils, so Marcus must go through 220 Ã· 44, or 5 bundles. Sample solution C: Students might create a ratio table to find that 5 bundles are needed.",,
20,Back-to-School Puzzlers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
21,Back-to-School Puzzlers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"4. 2 quarters, 3 dimes, 2 nickels, and 1 penny.",,
22,Back-to-School Puzzlers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"5. Pencil: $1.05. Eraser: $0.05. Possible solution strategies: (1) Try trial and error; or (2) set up and solve the equation x + (x + $1.00) = $1.10, where x = price of the eraser. A common error is to claim that the pencil costs $1.00 and the eraser costs $0.10.",,
23,Back-to-School Puzzlers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"6.Sample explanation: The student is mixing hours and days, which results in double counting the 16 hours of sleep and relaxation on the weekends and holidays (first as hours, then later as part of the days that are subtracted). The sleep and relaxation hours account for 116 days Ã",,
24,Back-to-School Puzzlers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Another explanation: Rather than trying to address the studentâ,,
25,Back-to-School Puzzlers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Field-Test Comments,,
26,Back-to-School Puzzlers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"My sixth-grade prealgebra students surprised me when I projected this Cartoon Corner on the board. With only the cartoon visible, I had students informing me that the atomic number for boron was 5 and that the number of lines in a Shakespearean sonnet was 14!",,
27,Back-to-School Puzzlers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Square roots and the radical symbol were familiar to the majority of the class. Solving problem 1b generated a discussion of multiple problem-solving strategies. Some students realized that the difference between,,
28,Back-to-School Puzzlers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
29,Back-to-School Puzzlers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,is 12 â,,
30,Back-to-School Puzzlers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"For problem 1c, students worked backward. Knowing that the answer was 34, they subtracted 19 (sum of the atomic number for boron and the number of lines in the sonnet), and realized that the square root of a number must be 15. Because 152 = 225, the number is 225.",,
31,Back-to-School Puzzlers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,The most entertaining discussions came with problem 6 and the examination of the studentâ,,
32,Back-to-School Puzzlers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Opportunities for interdisciplinary connections are great with these questions. Asking students to write their own problems across subjects is the best way to make the mathematics meaningful.,,

36,Back-to-School Puzzlers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I field-tested this Cartoon Corner with two seventh-grade prealgebra classes. I gave the first class fifteen minutes of quiet think time to solve the problems. After fifteen minutes, most students had solutions for about half the problems. I assumed that prealgebra students would know the meaning of square root, but two students were completely stuck on that concept. Once students began talking, those who did understand perfect squares and square roots taught others at their tables.",,
37,Back-to-School Puzzlers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"During my next prealgebra class, I began the activity with a short discussion of square numbers and square roots, eliciting student responses about their level of understanding. This made the second class period a bit more efficient. After quiet think time, I allowed students to talk about solutions. In both classes I gave them the remainder of the problems as homework.",,
38,Back-to-School Puzzlers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Almost all students made the anticipated error in the solution for problem 5, incorrectly finding the price of an eraser to be 10 cents. A few examples of correct student reasoning are listed (see fig. 1).",,
39,Back-to-School Puzzlers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
40,Back-to-School Puzzlers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Most students cited problem 6 as very confusing and difficult to solve. Many did not have an answer at all. Figure 2a shows a student who systematically looked through each component of the problem (this was the most complete answer I received in both classes) and determined the error in the logic. Figure 2b shows a student beginning to look at the problem mathematically but then possibly not persevering through the rest of it and answering in a less mathematical fashion.,,

42,Back-to-School Puzzlers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Overall, students were very motivated to work on this Cartoon Corner. Students said the majority of questions were really easy to â",,

47,Back-to-School Puzzlers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,I tried this activity with my eighth graders in small groups. One group was in the middle to high level and the other group was low to middle. Students had previously worked with square roots. My students were quick to identify the correct answer to problem 1and really enjoyed seeing the comic â,,
48,Back-to-School Puzzlers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"For problem 4, I discovered that not all my students were able to count money independently. To solve the problem, we made an organized list, which my students have a lot of experience with from prior years.",,
