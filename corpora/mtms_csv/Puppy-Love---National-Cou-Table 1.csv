2,Puppy Love - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The Puppy Love problem asked students to use their prior knowledge of measures of central tendency to determine a data set when given the mean, mode, median, and range of the set. This problem caused students to think differently about the measures of central tendency and enriched their understanding of statistical measures. It also met Smith and Steins (1998) criteria as a task with a higher level of cognitive demand because it required that students",,
3,Puppy Love - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"explore and understand the nature of mathematical concepts, processes, or relationships;",,
4,Puppy Love - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"analyze the task and constraints, which may have limited possible solution strategies and solutions; and",,
5,Puppy Love - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"use considerable cognitive effort, which may have involved some level of anxiety for the student because of the unpredictable nature of the necessary solution process.",,
6,Puppy Love - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"For this problem, we received work from twenty students in the fifth and sixth grades, submitted by three teachers, Karen Anderson, Tracy Grosick, and Walter Stark. Four solution strategies were identified: guess and check, logical reasoning, making an organized list, and using manipulatives. The most prevalent strategy used was guess and check, exemplified by Ian, a student in Grosicks class, who explained his strategy in this way:",,
7,Puppy Love - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"My strategy was to figure out how many puppies there were (7) and then multiply that by the mean (15) and got 105. That is what all my numbers would have to add up to so that the mean would be 15. First I put two fourteens and one at the middle because the median and mode had to be 14. Finally, I just kept trying different numbers to try to get 105. For the second one I just added one or two to a number and then subtracted the same amount to another number.",,
8,Puppy Love - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"To find a second data set, Ian used an evening out strategy, adding 1 or 2 to one of the data points and then subtracting the same amount from another data point. As long as he left the two 14s in the middle, this strategy kept the mean, median, and mode the same.",,
9,Puppy Love - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"This strategy was also used by Sarah, Anushri, Patrice, Ian, and Arunima, who were students in Starks class. Arunima went so far as to explain why his guess would not work and how he thought about improving his next guess. Many students at this age fail to consider the reasonableness of their guess in an effort to improve their next guess. Hats off to Arunima! (See fig. 1.)",,
10,Puppy Love - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
11,Puppy Love - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Madeline, who is a student in Andersons class, used logical reasoning, as did many others. These students considered the definition of median, mode, mean, and range and used this information to find a data set (see fig. 2).",,
12,Puppy Love - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
13,Puppy Love - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Madeline knew that 14, as the median, must be the middle number when the data points were listed in order of magnitude and that it must also occur most often because it was also the mode. Knowing that 15 was the mean and that there were 7 points in the data set, the sum of all 7 must be 7  15, or 105. Since she had used the number 14 as three data points, the remaining 4 points must sum to 63. She calculated the mean of the 4 unknown data points, which was 15.75. Knowing that the points needed to be whole numbers, she added or subtracted to 15.75 until she found 4  points that summed to 63 but that also yielded a range of 8. This strategy was also used by Ajay, Kevin, Gabrielle, Sara, Amanda, and Tekla who were in Starks class; and by Christopher, Sean, Nathan, Holly, and Charlie, who were students in Grosicks class.",,
14,Puppy Love - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Only Karissa, a student in Starks class, used an organized list to help her solve the problem. Karissas systematic strategy of ruling out possible combinations is shown in figure 3.",,
15,Puppy Love - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
16,Puppy Love - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Grosick provided cubes for her students to use while solving the problem. Teresa explained how she used the cubes to help her solve the problem (see fig. 4).,,
17,Puppy Love - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
18,Puppy Love - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"However, she did not explain how she determined the remaining data points after using 14 for the median and the mode. She made seven towers (rone for each puppy), in which each cube in the tower represented 1 ounce of the puppys weight. However, the cube configuration did not match the strategy she described, which can lead one to believe that she might have used a guess-and-check strategy, adding or taking away cubes from each stack until all the given criteria were reached. In her description of her strategy, she changed one of the towers of 14 to be sure she had a range of 8 and a mean of 15. Manipulatives can be helpful tools to allow students to visualize the problem; they also make it easier to try different combinations.",,
19,Puppy Love - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Not all students attempted questions 2 and 3. Gabrielles strategy was typical of the solutions that we did receive for these questions (see fig. 5).,,
20,Puppy Love - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
21,Puppy Love - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Gabrielle at first said that the mean, median, mode, and range would increase by 8 if all the puppies gained 8 ounces in the first week. But, when she actually added 8 to each of the puppys birth weights, she realized that the range would not change. Asking students to estimate before solving is an excellent teaching strategy so that students will analyze the situation for reasonableness before and after solving the problem. This request increases number sense.",,
22,Puppy Love - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Holly used a different strategy to determine the new mean for the second week when the puppies had each gained 8 ounces. Rather than determine the weight of each puppy, she determined how many ounces would be added to the sum of the puppys weights (see fig. 6), then determined the new mean.",,
23,Puppy Love - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
24,Puppy Love - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Students who attempted question 3 used Anushris strategy to find the new weight for each puppy and then determined the mean (see fig. 7).,,
25,Puppy Love - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
26,Puppy Love - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Not all students added the 10s and 16s and subtracted the 3s from the weights of the same puppy, and yet they all obtained the same number for the mean. This is a big idea for middle-grades students: It does not matter which puppy gained 10 ounces or lost 3 ounces, just knowing that one puppy did gain or lose that weight is enough to determine the new mean. A strategy similar to Hollys for question 2 could also be used. For example, the mean would change by +10, +10, +10, +16, +16, 3, and 3, or +56. Adding 56 to 161 yields a sum of 217 for the puppy weights and a mean of 31.",,
27,Puppy Love - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"One valuable attribute of this problem was that it was accessible to the younger students at the middle school level. Stark reported that he was hesitant to use this problem with his fifth-grade students because he had not yet addressed the ideas related to data analysis. However, because he stated that he was constantly trying to develop habits of mind for learning, doing, and applying mathematics, he encouraged his students to tackle problems that might at first glance be beyond their understanding or level of knowledge. In so doing, he was pleasantly surprised at their solutions and how they communicated with each other to solve the problem.",,
28,Puppy Love - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"For example, according to Stark,",,
29,Puppy Love - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Tekla noticed immediately that the median was 14 and there were 7 numbers. That meant that the middle number had to be 14, with three numbers on each side. Anushri added that if you added up all of the numbers for the weights that the total had to be 105 because the mean was 15.",,
30,Puppy Love - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Stark ended his reflection with, What a wonderful learning experience we had and what a way to develop true knowledge and understanding.",,
31,Puppy Love - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Grosick reiterated the beliefs expressed by Stark in her reflection, stating, We reflect each day on the eight mathematical practices and the problem-solving process. Students were also introduced to metacognition at the beginning of the school year to foster more awareness for how they approach problems and their motivations.",,
32,Puppy Love - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Indeed, teachers are responsible for shaping and directing students activities so that they have opportunities to engage meaningfully in mathematics. The tasks in which students engage must encourage them to reason about mathematical ideas; to make connections; and to formulate, grapple with, and solve problems.",,
33,Puppy Love - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,We hope that teachers will use the Solve It problems in their classrooms to engage students in mathematical reasoning. We thank these teachers for sending us their students work on the Puppy Love problem:,,
