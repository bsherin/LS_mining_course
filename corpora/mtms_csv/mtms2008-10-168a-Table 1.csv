Such a view—which is rather uncommon in our culture where mathematical ideas are rarely shared or discussed outside the classroom or mathematics community—leads us to consider parallels between the arts and mathematics. It makes us think about what constitutes a favorite book or movie or a favorite mathematics idea or activity. It also leads us to look to the performing arts to understand students’ repertoires for organizing and expressing the mathematical ideas they seek to communicate to one another and to their worlds outside the classroom. ,2,mtms2008-10-168a,,
"The idea of “students as performance mathematicians” is new in mathematics education. It offers a fresh perspective on what school mathematics might be and how students might experience the subject. Some mathematical films exist, such  as the short films from the 1960s by René Jodoin at the National Film Board of Canada: Spheres (1969), Dance Squared (1961), and Notes on a Triangle (1966). Some mathematical songs are also used in schools, such as “Zero, My Hero” (Schoolhouse Rock 1973). Popular movies about mathematicians, such as Good Will Hunting and A Beautiful Mind, are not performances of mathematics but rather of the social adventures of mathematicians. Some examples of artistic mathematical performances by students can be found on the Web, such as images of geometric art, typically using tessellations, and student-produced mathematical videos that appear on YouTube. We have created a variety of mathematical performances (see www .edu.uwo.ca/mathscene) and have also worked on developing a Canada-wide Math Performance Festival (see www .mathfest.ca). However, it is fair to say that the idea of students creating mathematical performances as a way of communicating their ideas within the classroom and to the world beyond is new.

"It is common for people to discuss books and movies. However, you might have a difficult time imagining students sharing their favorite mathematics problems or experiences and discussing their thoughts and feelings. We seem to have a problem using imagination in mathematics. In fact, the word imagination is rarely found in a mathematics curriculum document and is never mentioned in grades 1−12 mathematics curriculum documents for the provinces of Alberta and of Ontario. However, for the time it takes to read this article, put aside any preconceptions you might have about the subject. Imagine mathematics as a fully human experience (Higginson 2006) that engages our thoughts, feelings, and senses and as something you would want to share with others.

In the latter case, students might find the sum by seeing that pairs of “opposite” numbers, such as 1 and 19 and 3 and 17, have the same sum of 20 (see fig. 2).

"Consider the L pattern shown  in figure 1, which is depicted in the fifth-grade mathematics curriculum for the province of Ontario (Ontario Ministry of Education 2005, p. 83). The problem asks students to notice how the pattern grows and describe what the next stage might be. We can extend this problem and increase its potential for being “worth talking about” by asking, “If you were to build this pattern using linking cubes, how many cubes would you need to build the first ten stages?” ",17,mtms2008-10-168a,,
"As students start counting the cubes  needed for each stage, they might notice that the diagram contains the odd numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9. Thus, finding how many linking cubes are needed to build the first ten stages is equivalent  stages, and three stages, and noting this pattern of square numbers: one stage needs 1 cube; two stages need 4 cubes; three stages need 9 cubes; and so forth. Still others may construct the stages shown in figure 1 and play with them, finding that by moving the Ls, they fit into one another to form a square (as shown in fig. 3). Students could hypothesize that since five stages create a 5 × 5 square, ten stages might create a 10 × 10 square. They might also extend the original problem and hypothesize that to create one hundred stages, 100 × 100 linking cubes would be needed. This leads to an algebraic representation of the solution: The sum of the first n odd numbers is n × n, or n2. The visual proof for this algebraic representation is the square formed by the Ls.",18,mtms2008-10-168a,,
"The problem can be extended  further by considering this question: “What changes if we take one block away from each stage?” (See fig. 4.) “How many linking cubes are needed to create the first ten stages of this new pattern?” This small change results in a physical representation of the positive even numbers.

Students might wonder whether the even numbers could be added using complementary pairs, as was the case with the odd numbers. They might think about whether the stages of the pattern could be combined to also form a square or a different shape. In fact, the representations and solution strategies discussed here could also be used for this new problem. Figure 5 shows how physical representations of the first four stages (or the first four even numbers) can be rearranged to form a 4 × 5 rectangle. Figure 5 is visual scaffolding and provides a visual proof that the sum of the first 100 even numbers is 100 × 101, and the sum of the first n even numbers is n × (n + 1). It is also interesting to explore the similarities and differences between the visual models of the sum of the first n odd numbers and the sum of the first n even numbers. ",23,mtms2008-10-168a,,

Boorstin suggests that we experience three distinct pleasures from watching a movie, which we will paraphrase: (1) the pleasure of experiencing the new, the wonderful, and the surprising in mathematics; (2) the pleasure of experiencing emotional mathematical moments (either our own or others); and (3) the visceral pleasure of sensing mathematical beauty.",27,mtms2008-10-168a,,

"The L pattern activity offers a number of surprises: As a representation of the odd numbers, it reveals that the sums of these odd numbers are square numbers, which can be represented physically as squares. We can also add the odd numbers by pairing the first with the last, the second with the second last, and so forth. Suddenly, the simple problem of extending the pattern becomes complex and interesting. The students we have worked with express surprise about “how the L patterns turned out to fit in a perfect square.” The problem can be extended, because taking a block away from each stage introduces us to the even numbers and different yet similar ways of finding their sums. In addition to experiencing surprise, students take pleasure in seeing something new and wonderful in mathematics, namely, the web of relationships created between sums of odd and sums of even numbers and among linking cubes, odd numbers,  sums of odd numbers, algebraic patterns, and visual proofs.

Experiencing a Mathematical Moment,30,mtms2008-10-168a,,
"Students who work on this activity become excited about the patterns they see, and they share their ideas and their excitement with others. Students may also experience moments of frustration or anxiety and share these emotions, as well. One student commented, “I felt like I was a lot younger because I haven’t played with these blocks for a very long time.” Another said, “I liked this more because I was more challenged than regular math.” We can imagine a classroom in which emotional moments become visible and valued, making mathematics more of a human endeavor, employing both thinking and feeling.

Zwicky (2003) commented on this square pattern formed by the Ls, stating that such patterns draw our attention and invite us to “look at things like this” (p. 38).

"We can imagine students being introduced to Boorstin’s categories as a way of understanding various ways of experiencing mathematics. When we used Boorstin’s original labels—voyeuristic, vicarious, and visceral—in a sixth-grade classroom before working with the L pattern activities, we  noticed that some students started using these same labels: “Hey, this is voyeuristic, isn’t it?” It is also interesting that about half the students reported sharing the L pattern activities  with their parents, either as a puzzle for them to solve or as show and tell, even though this was not explicitly requested by us. However, they were told that they could keep a 5 × 5 square of linking cubes if they wanted. Access to the concrete materials helps students perform mathematics. This spilling over of mathematics beyond the classroom automatically creates an audience and is a first step for students performing mathematics. The emotional aspect of the  experience is an important part of mathematical performance. We have found that students have a difficult time talking about feelings associated with doing mathematics. When asked what they felt during the L pattern activities, most responded with “okay,” “it was fun,” or “I don’t know.” It takes some probing and modeling before students express their feelings in more elaborate ways. We have also found that asking students to create artwork to express or represent some ideas in the activities helps them connect emotionally with the mathematics. (See the example in fig. 7.)

"Good problems worthy of performance are not grade specific. We have used the L activity in the context of patterning in fourth-grade and sixth-grade classrooms; in eleventh-grade classrooms, it was used in the context of sequences  and series. Looking for problems worthy of performance implies that we as teachers need to put aside the common misconception that a good teacher makes learning easy. Rather, we see our role as creating mathematical situations where students have to think hard. Instead of reducing mathematical complexity, we seek to increase it, as illustrated in the two problems below. ",48,mtms2008-10-168a,,
Parallel Lines,49,mtms2008-10-168a,,
"It is typically assumed that parallel lines are straight lines that never meet. When we have asked middle school students and teachers to tell us what they know about parallel lines, that explanation is usually all that is given. A few students and teachers might recall some rules about angle properties and a transversal crossing two parallel lines. It is interesting that although we live our lives on a sphere (or an approximate sphere), spherical geometry is rarely addressed in middle school mathematics. Using a sphere helps students experience new and wonderful perspectives of ordinary mathematical concepts. (We use balloons on which students draw and explore “lines.”) The issue involving straightness becomes complex, and although there are no extrinsically straight paths on a sphere, intrinsically straight paths do exist (e.g., geodesics, or great circles, as in the lines of longitude and the equator) (Henderson  2001; Henderson and Taimina 2006). Two lines of longitude (two geodesics) cross the equator (another geodesic) at 90 degrees. In Euclidean geometry, the two lines would be parallel. In the context of spherical geometry, the concept of parallel increases in complexity. There are no parallel lines on a sphere from an extrinsic perspective; however, there are lines that feel parallel, and are intrinsically parallel, such as lines of longitude, which we often depict as straight, parallel lines on flat maps of the earth. Also, if we form a “triangle” using three geodesics on a sphere, the sum of its angles is not 180 degrees but varies within a range of values. Students express surprise and comment “about how much there is to learn about parallel lines on a sphere and on a flat surface”; that “there might be more than one answer to a mathematical question”; and that “I really needed to use my imagination and personal theories to answer some of the questions.”",50,mtms2008-10-168a,,

"Fig. 10 A student’s sketch, and explanation, of the graph of x4 + y4 + 6 = 10 equation and then calculate the second number. We use a die to give a sense of randomness to the numbers that are generated and thus potentially increase the mathematical surprise experienced by students when they notice patterns emerging. Students roll their dice to find as many different sums as possible. They record the pairs of numbers in a table and graph the pairs of numbers as ordered pairs on paper. As students plot points, they are surprised that the points line up. “That’s interesting,” we note. “Let’s consider if another equation like this would also form a line. Let’s try the equation __ + __ = 6.” Students create a table of values and then plot the ordered pairs on the same grid as __ + __ = 10, noticing that the relations formed two parallel lines (see fig. 9). The next equation we consider is __ + __ = 4, and students plot its graph on the same grid as the others (see fig. 9). We discuss the patterns in the graphs and consider how we might predict  the shapes of graphs of similar equations or predict equations from other, similar graphs. The next task we pose asks students to create equations that generate graphs with different slopes or that are curved. Students are also given access to online plotting software, which they use to test their equations by graphing them. Students focus intensely on this activity and excitedly share their findings with others when they discover new shapes of graphs. Figure 10 shows what one student shared about one of the graphs discovered. This activity gives students a lot of practice finding missing values in equations. They also get a sense of how functions and relations are generated and how equations relate to their graphs.",53,mtms2008-10-168a,,
"We do not believe that artistic  mathematical expression is possible in a mathematics program whose focus is on procedural rather than conceptual knowledge.
