"A carnival game has two boxes with an undetermined number of chips in each. All the chips are numbered either 1, 2, or 3. A chip is randomly selected from each box to form a two-digit number. The following probabilities (P) are possible: •  P(drawing 11) = 1/6 •  P(drawing 22) = 1/24 •  P(drawing 33) = 1/8",3,mtms2008-03-410a,,

"Sloan Scully’s fifth-grade class at Mount Prospect Elementary School in Basking Ridge, New Jersey, worked on a solution to the task. The work of Jeffrey, one of her students, is featured in figure 1. Jeffrey took advantage of the fact that the selection of a number from the first box does not affect the selection of a number from the second ",6,mtms2008-03-410a,,

This department shares the thinking of middle school students as they explore and communicate mathematics. It highlights students’ work, including projects, investigations, or creative solutions to the problems in the monthly “Solve It!” department. Original student work is included along with sufficient information about the activity so that readers can try the ideas with their students. Please send manuscripts to the editor, edward s.

In other words, the probability of drawing an 11 is the probability of drawing a 1 from the first box and drawing a 1 from the second box. Since the events are independent, the probability that both events, a 1 drawn from each box, occur is the product of the two probabilities, as shown in figure 2.",7,mtms2008-03-410a,,
"Jeffrey considered what the probabilities could be. Since P(drawing 11) is 1/6, he knew that P(drawing 1 from the first box) • P(drawing 1 from the second box) also had to be 1/6. He thought about the factors of 6 and what fractions he could multiply to obtain a product of 1/6. He ruled out 1 and 1/6, since a probability of 1 would imply that one of the boxes only contained chips numbered 1. So the probability of drawing a 1 from one of the boxes is 1/2, and the probability of drawing a 1 from the other box is 1/3.",8,mtms2008-03-410a,,
"Since the P(drawing 22) is 1/24 and 24 has too many factors, Jeffrey determined the possible probabilities for selecting a 3 from the first box and selecting a 3 from the second box in a similar manner as he did for the 1’s. He tried letting P(drawing 1 from the first box) and P(drawing a 3 from the first box) both be 1/2. However, this meant that P(selecting  1 or 3 from the first box) would be 1/2 + 1/2, or 1. This would mean that there were no chips numbered 2. So he switched information so that the P(drawing a 3 from the first box) was 1/4 and that P(drawing a 3 from the second box) was 1/2.",9,mtms2008-03-410a,,
"After assigning the probabilities  for drawing a 1 or a 3 from each box, he was able to determine the probability of drawing a 2 from each box. From there, he used that information plus the fact that the selection of numbers was independent to determine the probability of selecting each possible number greater than 22. He then added the probabilities to determine the probability of drawing a number greater than 22. ",10,mtms2008-03-410a,,
"The nice part of Jeffrey’s solution is that it is not dependent on the sample space. The students I work with will typically try various numbers of chips in each box. They realize that there must be at least three chips in each box to have a 1-, 2-, and 3-numbered chip. Eventually, unlike Jeffrey, they will look at the probability of drawing 22 being 1/24. Students will realize that if there are three chips in the first box and three chips in the second box, then 9 two-digit numbers can be formed. So to get a probability of 1/24, they consider having 24 two-digit numbers possible. This means that there are either three chips in the first box and eight in the second box, eight chips in the first box and three in the second box, four chips in the first box and six in the second box, or six chips in the first box and four in the second box. Each one of these possibilities will result in a sample space that will meet the conditions given. The difference ",11,mtms2008-03-410a,,

"Since the probability of drawing 11 is 1/6, there must be a 1/2 chance of drawing a 1 in the first-digit box and a 1/3 chance of drawing a 1 in the second-digit box or vice versa. That is because the factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, 6. Since you cannot have 1 or 1/1, a definite probability, you cannot have 6. So it must be 1/2 and 1/3.",13,mtms2008-03-410a,,

"Similar to the 11, there is a 1/2 chance of getting a 3 in the first box and a 1/4 chance of getting a 3 in the second box, or vice versa. (The factors of 8 are 1, 2, 4, 8). So we have    P(drawing 1) 1/2    P(drawing 3) 1/2 ",15,mtms2008-03-410a,,

"There are a wide variety of ways to arrange the chips for this particular task, beyond the ones discussed here. It would be interesting to have students explore the different arrangements that would be possible. Students could try creating their own arrangements of different numbered  chips and provide probabilistic information for other students to use to determine the arrangement of chips in each box they created. This task is an interesting way to think about conditional probability and sample space. ",27,mtms2008-03-410a,,
