6,Window on Resources - March 2014,"This book contains sixty mathematical paradoxes, fallacies, and mind bogglers to challenge students to think, analyze,  and discuss at higher levels. Although it is intended for grades 6-12, this book would be most effective for the majority of students in grades 9-12. Although a few of the activities may be used in grades 6-8 to challenge honor students, the concepts are better suited for high school mathematics. Each activity has two parts, the student activity and the teachers’ notes. The student activity is blackline copy that may be reproduced. The student activity pages can also be found on the NCTM website using  an access code given in the book, alleviating the need to copy them from the text. The teachers’ notes include an explanation, comments, and the historical background of the concept. ",6,Window on Resources - March 2014
7,Window on Resources - March 2014,The book is organized by key  concepts and includes a key concept matrix. This matrix makes it easy to identify the activities that correspond to the concept being taught. The activities can lead to deep mathematical discourse within the classroom and go beyond basic concepts into higherlevel-thinking skills. I recommend this book to challenge and expand your students’ mathematical thinking.,7,Window on Resources - March 2014

When the question is posed verbally, a student indicates that 1/4 is larger because 4 is larger than 3; with visual representations, this misconception is eliminated. From this example, teachers are clearly educated on using different modalities to assess and teach. Another question discusses the numeric representation of three halves of two brownies: “3/4 of 2 brownies?” or  “3/2 brownies?” Students are thus made aware that the contextual unit is important in the quantification.",15,Window on Resources - March 2014

30,Window on Resources - March 2014,"This book presents a method for differentiating instruction in the classroom through the use of menus, with a variety of tasks addressing multiple learning styles and levels of Bloom’s taxonomy. The author provides a strong rationale for giving students a choice in their assignments to meet the adolescent’s need for independence and socialization. It also details the benefits, limitations, and time considerations for six different kinds of menus and provides example menus for low-level and at-level content.

31,Window on Resources - March 2014,"I noticed increased motivation in  my seventh-grade classroom with  90 percent of my students while they were using the menus. That said, however, the book fails to provide for the explicit needs of struggling students. The activities do not offer practice of the math concepts or address the need for higher complexity problem solving that is required through the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics. Students needed substantial feedback on how to create adequate products. Record keeping for the menus is highly challenging; there is no standard answer key, so the teacher needs to do individual calculations on each student’s different product to evaluate accuracy and understanding.
