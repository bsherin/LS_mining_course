7,New Horizons,"The New Horizons spaceship launched from Earth on January 19, 2006, to study Pluto and its moons. New Horizons made its closest approach to the Pluto system on July 14, 2015, more than 9.5 years later, having traveled more than 3 billion miles. This distance is hard to visualize. One way to visualize large distances is to use familiar lengths and ratios. For example, the Deepsea Challenger (a submersible vehicle) traveled 10,994 meters to reach the bottom of the Mariana Trench. The depth of the trench is about the same length as 100 football fields, lined end to end (since each football field is about 110 meters long).",7,New Horizons

You may want to say something like “3 billion miles is the same distance as __________ trips from ________________________  to _______________________” or “3 billion miles is the same distance as ____________________________________________________.” 2. Remember that your goal is to help someone else visualize the distance  that New Horizons traveled. Be sure to explain why you chose the comparison you did and how you came to your conclusions.,9,New Horizons

12,New Horizons,"This department shares creative solutions to the problems in Solve It. Edited by  Annie Perkins, annie.k.perkins@gmail .com, and Pamela J. Wells, wellsp@ gvsu.edu, Grand Valley State University, Allendale, Michigan.   wWhen posing the New Horizons  problem, we meant to encourage students to grapple with the enormous scale present in the value “3 billion.” Teachers often pose problems that contain enormous values, but they do not always pause to appreciate the sheer size of the values that they so readily offer for computation. In this problem, students attempted to interpret the value 3 billion using other distances that held personal meaning for them, and some reached out to compare that number with other, seemingly large, yet more comprehendible, values. Their chosen scales reveal how our students currently view the world and also how truly challenging it is to comprehend a value as large as 3 billion. ",12,New Horizons
13,New Horizons,"Xavier, a student from A. Fantis Parochial School in Brooklyn, New York, solved the problem using a particularly meaningful comparison: He plans to travel to Haiti this summer to visit family and thus used the benchmark of the approximately 2,000-mile trip from the United States to Haiti. Xavier concluded that multiplying 1,500,000 by 2,000 would be the equivalent of traveling to Pluto. Xavier’s classmate, Devonte, also used a familiar scale—his neighborhood: “3 billion miles is the same distance as 1 billion trips from Martense St. Brooklyn to Atlantic Avenue Barclays Center St.” (See fig. 1.) He continued with “the person that looks at my answer can look at Google® maps and see how far 3 miles are and imagine the distance 1 billion times.” ",13,New Horizons
14,New Horizons,Another A. Fantis Parochial ,14,New Horizons
15,New Horizons,"School student, Constantinos, concluded that the New Horizons trip was equivalent to 207,383 round trips to China from the United States. He justified his choice in this way: “As you know China is very far away from America and 207,383 is a big number so you can imagine how amazingly far 3 billion miles is.” All three of these ",15,New Horizons
16,New Horizons,"Fig. 1 Devonte’s scale was his neighborhood, concluding that “1 billion trips from Martense St. Brooklyn to Atlantic Avenue Barclays Center St.” equals 3 billion.",16,New Horizons
17,New Horizons,"students chose to solve this problem using a distance familiar to them in some way, thus applying the fifth Standard for Mathematical Practice (Use appropriate tools strategically) by selecting seemingly large, familiar distances and placing the New Horizons trip in terms of those distances. ",17,New Horizons
18,New Horizons,"Lauren, a seventh-grade student from Wilmette Junior High School in Wilmette, Illinois, chose her comparison in a similar fashion, selecting the 2,092-mile trip from the West coast to the East coast of the United States. She concluded that one would need to travel this distance 1.4 million times to equal the New Horizons trip. Her reason for selecting it, much like Constantinos’s choice, was that “many people would be able to understand that the length of the U.S. is very large in size . . . many people are familiar with the U.S., which is why it would be easy to understand for most people.” ",18,New Horizons
19,New Horizons,"Another interesting analysis  was made by Ethan, a student from ",19,New Horizons
20,New Horizons,"Wilmette Junior High School. He chose to compare New Horizons to the largest and smallest distances that students chose. For the largest distance, Ethan calculated that 12,000 trips to the moon multiplied by 250,000 miles each totaled 3 billion. For the smallest-distance choice, he multiplied, using the ratio of 17.6 football fields per mile, to conclude that the New Horizons trip is 52,800,000,000 football fields. Ethan was the only student to select a measurement less than 1 mile. ",20,New Horizons
21,New Horizons,"In sifting through these responses,  it is clear that students reached out first for large, yet familiar, distances. It is also clear that 3 billion is a difficult value to comprehend. Although scales like Constantinos’s put the trip in terms familiar to him, 1 billion is not much easier to comprehend than 3 billion. ",21,New Horizons
22,New Horizons,"In posing a similar problem in the future, we might encourage a scaffolded approach wherein students explore less daunting distances first, and then ",22,New Horizons

25,New Horizons,"Length of 1 mile collaborate on several different ways to put large values into context. None of the students here tried to grapple with the value 3 billion directly, but chose instead to keep it always in terms of distances. In the future, we might ask students to put this trip in terms of time: “How many years would it take you to walk, run, or drive that distance?” Students could also be asked to think in terms of objects: “How much space would   3 billion coins/pop cans/pencils occupy? What about a stadium? A skyscraper?” Another thought is to connect the value to other mathematical content standards, like scientific notation, or exponential relationships.",25,New Horizons
26,New Horizons,"Comparison tasks like these help  students build number sense for extremely large (and extremely small numbers). Just as younger students use benchmark numbers to help them solve addition and subtraction  problems, these sorts of tasks can help middle-grades students develop benchmarks to help them understand large numbers. As math teachers, we continually ask students to make sense of problems; exercises like this one can help them make sense of values, too. ",26,New Horizons
