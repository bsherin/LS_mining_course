"n − 3 4.  By drawing a diagonal in the quadrilateral, two triangles are formed. Since the sum of the interior angles of each is 180°, the sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is 360°.  5.  By drawing two diagonals from the same vertex in a pentagon, three triangles are formed. Thus, the sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is 3(180°) = 540°. A similar procedure reveals that a hexagon has 720°, a heptagon has 900°, and an octagon has 1080°.  6.  a.  The sum of the interior angles for a 20-gon is (20 – 2)(180°) = 3240°.    b.

"I used this activity at the end of the school year with a sixth-grade prealgebra class and seventh-grade algebra 1 class. All students were ready for a little comic relief. The cartoon generated much discussion, as some were unfamiliar with the term irony. Others thought that Pythagoras was the only Greek who gave us geometric concepts. Both classes had previously proved that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle equals 180 degrees by tearing the angles from any given triangle and placing the vertices together to create a straight angle. Most students were able to complete the fi rst four questions independently. They used the four angles of quadrilaterals to produce a circle but soon realized that this approach was impractical for polygons with more sides. ",25,mtms2010-12-266a,,
"Working together, the class created the table to look for a pattern. A few drew all possible diagonals before realizing that they were just trying to subdivide each polygon into the requisite number of triangles. Many students quickly deduced the usual formula as they moved from dodecagons to n-gons. ",26,mtms2010-12-266a,,
Prealgebra and algebra 1 teachers often search for meaningful activities that ask their students to examine patterns and write expressions to model a situation. This activity applies this skill by connecting geometry and algebra. ,27,mtms2010-12-266a,,

"I used this problem with my two seventh-grade mathematics classes. It was a great introduction into a review of the geometry we had learned. We were able to talk about Euclid and relate him to Pythagoras. The cartoon gave my students a chance to compare and contrast two-dimensional and three-dimensional figures and renew some vocabulary that had become  a little stale (for example, regular  polygons, diagonals, interior angles).",31,mtms2010-12-266a,,
"Questions 4−6 were a great explora- tion, but my students needed a lot of  guidance to move into an understanding of what was expected of them. This part of the activity required more guidance. It did, however, provide a nice link to the tables, graphs, and rules in activities that we had recently covered.",32,mtms2010-12-266a,,

"To introduce the “Shaping Up” lesson, I displayed the cartoon on the main board as my seventh graders entered the classroom. There was a lot of interest in the cartoon, but many students did not understand it. The dual meanings of the word shape confused many of them so we answered question 1 as a whole group. After that, however, students were able to tackle the rest of the questions with minimal assistance from me as they worked in pairs. ",35,mtms2010-12-266a,,
"This was a great review activity,  which combined geometry and algebra. The discussions that students were having were rich with mathematical vocabulary. I particularly liked its accessibility for many skill levels. The more advanced students in the class were kept challenged with questions 6 and 7 while other students were able to complete question 5 and feel successful.",36,mtms2010-12-266a,,
