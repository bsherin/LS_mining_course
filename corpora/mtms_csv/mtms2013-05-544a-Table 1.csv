Rather than accepting or rejecting a student’s answer, a teacher may request that the student provide more insight into his or her reasoning.",15,mtms2013-05-544a,,
 Episode 1,16,mtms2013-05-544a,,
Jenkins and a student were discussing a problem in which students had to determine which of two linear functions would grow faster based on a table of values they had created (see fig. 1 and fig. 2). Jenkins asked a student to provide an explanation.,17,mtms2013-05-544a,,
"Jenkins: Now, one of the questions was,  which equation actually increases quicker? What do you think, Jason?",18,mtms2013-05-544a,,
"Jason: Um, the one on the right.",19,mtms2013-05-544a,,
Jenkins: Now why does it increase quicker? Why did you say that?,20,mtms2013-05-544a,,
"Jason: Because for every one the x goes  up, the y goes up by 3. So, like, if you look at 10 on both of ’em, the one on the right’s obviously bigger.",21,mtms2013-05-544a,,
"In this dialogue, Jenkins asked Jason to explain why the second equation  10 10 2x – 4 2(1) - 4 2(2) – 4 2(3) – 4 2(4) – 4 2(5) – 4 2(6) – 4 2(7) – 4 2(8) – 4 2(9) – 4 2(10) – 4 3x + 1 3(1) + 1 3(2) + 1 3(3) + 1 3(4) + 1 3(5) + 1 3(6) + 1 3(7) + 1 3(8) + 1 3(9) + 1 3(10) + 1 -2 10 12 14 16 10 13 16 19 22 25 28 31 grew faster. By asking, “Why did you say that?” Jenkins created an opportunity to understand the reasoning behind Jason’s answer. This reasoning was especially significant in this case because although Jason’s answer was correct, his reasoning was only partially correct. His explanation revealed a misconception about the growth of the two equations. Jason’s strategy of looking at the x-coordinate of 10 on each equation displayed a misconception about the difference between analyzing the values of x and y and the growth rate of the equation. ",22,mtms2013-05-544a,,
This episode from Jenkins’s class highlights how important “request ,23,mtms2013-05-544a,,
"For each of the following two equations, make a table of values and then graph each equation. How are the graphs similar? Different? a. y = 2x + 7 b. y = 2(x + 3)",24,mtms2013-05-544a,,

Affirming or disregarding an answer will not reveal the student’s thinking, but requesting an explanation will give the teacher an opportunity to understand the student’s reasoning process. Moreover, Jenkins used Jason’s explanation as an opportunity to help Jason and the entire class improve their mathematical understanding of growth rates. ",26,mtms2013-05-544a,,
Episode 2,27,mtms2013-05-544a,,
"Students had to construct a table of values for two linear functions with the same slope but with different y-intercepts. The students also had to graph the functions and compare the graphs (see fig. 3). This episode illustrates how students can also “request an explanation” from their peers. Nancy,  a  student who went to the board to show her solution to the problem, had made a table of values. She chose -1, 1, 0, and 2 (in that order) as x-values for the two equations (see fig. 4). ",28,mtms2013-05-544a,,
"After Nancy’s presentation, Jenkins  prompted the class to ask questions about her explanation. A student asked her why she had chosen those values for x. Nancy said, “Well, that’s what we learned about last year, ’cuz it’s like the standard easy numbers to put for x.” Jenkins asked, “So, I can just choose any numbers I want for x?” Nancy said, “No, well, you can, but these are the easiest ones to do.” Jenkins repeated Nancy’s answer and asked the class if they agreed or disagreed. Students voiced that they agreed with Nancy’s statement. At this point, Jenkins asked, “Why do you agree?” and engaged students in a discussion about the reasons for choosing specific values for x. He then summarized the discussion by stating that when a specific set of values for x has not been provided, then one can choose values for x. ",29,mtms2013-05-544a,,
"In this episode, Jenkins gave an  example of an alternative way to elicit an explanation. Rather than pressing Nancy to explain her reasoning herself, Jenkins gave the rest of the class the opportunity to decide whether they wanted further explanation. In suspending his own judgment of Nancy’s answer and allowing his students to request more explanation, Jenkins enabled the class to lead the classroom discussion and to facilitate their own communication and reasoning with one another. Jenkins’s summary occurred when he had enabled students to work by themselves on the solution to a question. Students were discussing the domain of a linear function before being formally introduced to the concept of domain.",30,mtms2013-05-544a,,
"We find that episode 2 shows how  a teacher can provide opportunities for students to further develop their agency. In other words, it is important  for students to have the capacity to inquire into one another’s mathematical justifications and develop the habit of engaging in mathematical discussions. The teacher demonstrated his expectation that students were to listen to one another and be critical of others’ comments. At the same time, the teacher held students accountable for responding to others’ comments and questions. A teacher enabling students to request explanations from one another is crucial for building a mathematical community centered on students’ active engagement with mathematics.",31,mtms2013-05-544a,,

"In a classroom discussion, students can voice different ideas. However, it may be difficult for them to keep track of what other students have said. The move orient involves grouping many comments into a limited number of perspectives and allowing students  to compare those perspectives  (Ghousseini 2009; Chapin, O’Connor, and Anderson 2003). For example, ten different students may be participating in a discussion in which the under- lying mathematical ideas can be summarized and grouped into two or three perspectives. By orienting, a teacher clusters the ten different comments into a manageable number of ideas for the class to consider. Two functions of orienting are to (1) help students make sense of different approaches to solving a problem and (2) discuss different solutions to a problem. ",33,mtms2013-05-544a,,
Episode 3,34,mtms2013-05-544a,,
We saw an example of orienting in another discussion about comparing the two linear equations in figure 1. Students had to compare the growth rate of two linear functions and anticipate whether the graphs of those functions would intersect from study-,35,mtms2013-05-544a,,

ing the table of values. The following episode shows how Jenkins requested explanations and also oriented students’ discussion. This combination of moves enabled Jenkins to ask students to assume different positions regarding the answer to the problem as well as their justification for their answers. This discussion occurred after they had talked about the table of values representing each equation (see fig. 2).,37,mtms2013-05-544a,,
"Jenkins: Do the two lines, if you were to make a graph, ever actually intersect? Tim, what do you think?",38,mtms2013-05-544a,,
Tim: No. [Because] if you make a  graph. I didn’t make a graph but. . . .   Jenkins: OK. I didn’t say you had to  make a graph.,39,mtms2013-05-544a,,
Tim: Oh. I don’t know. OK.,40,mtms2013-05-544a,,
"Jenkins: Jason, what do you think?",41,mtms2013-05-544a,,
"Jason: Um, I think no.",42,mtms2013-05-544a,,
Jenkins: Anybody else?,43,mtms2013-05-544a,,
Renee: I said yes because on both sides you have some of the same numbers.,44,mtms2013-05-544a,,
"Jenkins: Ahh, OK, let’s look at this. ",45,mtms2013-05-544a,,
"What you are saying is, saying there is a 10 right here, right? As a y-value, and there’s a 10 right here as a yvalue. Since they have the same value of y, they must at some point meet.",46,mtms2013-05-544a,,
"In the episode, Jenkins combined two moves: requesting an explanation and orienting. He asked students to justify their answers and elicited different answers from students to establish that they had different positions. Some students (Tim and Jason) stated  did not evaluate Jason’s answer when he said incorrectly that the lines would not intersect. Instead, he deferred to the rest of the class when he asked, “Anybody else?”",47,mtms2013-05-544a,,
"As a result, he was able to provide opportunities for other students to think about and to evaluate  the original answer. Finally, Jenkins’s decision to open up  the discussion enabled him to elicit  a misconception that students possessed about the solution to a system of linear equations: If the y-values are repeated, then the lines must intersect. This was a crucial moment in the discussion, because Jenkins was able to tap into the students’ misconception and start a new discussion to address that misconception. ",48,mtms2013-05-544a,,
"The discursive moves that Jenkins  performed in this episode achieved the purpose of eliciting a misconception. Jenkins invited several students to participate during the discussion. As a result, there were different ideas for the class to consider. Then, Jenkins asked students to support their answers with an explanation. This was particularly important because Renee had stated the correct answer but had provided an incorrect justification.",49,mtms2013-05-544a,,
"Finally, Jenkins revoiced Renee’s idea with the specific case of y = 10, which allowed the entire class to see with a concrete example what the student had presented as a generalized solution. He could have asked Renee to further explain what she meant when she said that both sides had some of the same numbers. Through further discussion, Renee might elaborate on her idea that because the two tables included some of the same y-values, the graphs would intersect at those y-values.  ",50,mtms2013-05-544a,,
"As a possible follow-up to this episode, the teacher could show a graph  of the two functions to explore the possibility that the functions would intersect at the y-values that appeared in both graphs. This discussion could enable students to establish connections between multiple representations of a linear function, specifically, the formula, the table of values, and the graph. If students had graphing calculators, they could spend time discussing the graphs with their partners or in small groups.",51,mtms2013-05-544a,,
"Alternatively the teacher could  project the graphs on a large screen and discuss growth rates using the graphs. The discussion of the graph could help students develop new arguments about what it means for two graphs to intersect, creating an opportunity to eradicate the misconception that Renee revealed. This discussion might provide more opportunities for reasoning and sense making before the formal introduction of linear functions. ",52,mtms2013-05-544a,,
"Episode 4 As stated earlier, orienting could be performed when students voice ideas that appear to be different but actually are mathematically similar. We created a hypothetical scenario with the same problem as in episode 3, focusing on the question of whether two lines would intersect (see fig. 3). Various students provide different ideas when answering the question, and the teacher orients their ideas. The teacher asked the class if the two lines ever intersected and how they could be sure. Student responses included these: •	 Lilly: I said that they do not intersect. . . . Because there are not the same coordinates in the two tables.",53,mtms2013-05-544a,,
•	 Akuti: I said that they intersect. . . . ,54,mtms2013-05-544a,,
"Because if you continue the pattern in the table, you get to a point where the two xs and the two ys are the same.",55,mtms2013-05-544a,,
"Like Akuti, others believed the lines intersected and supported their conclusion: that the lines would not intersect. In contrast, another student (Renee) stated that the lines would intersect. The different opinions as to whether the lines would intersect or not gave an opportunity for Renee to state the reasons behind her answer. ",56,mtms2013-05-544a,,
"We find that this discussion could  have provided opportunities for students to develop their reasoning and sense making in several ways. First, the teacher’s question pushed students from using a table of values to visualizing the graph of the functions that the table of values represented. Therefore, even though the students had not constructed the graph, the teacher asked them to think about the graphs of the two linear functions as if these were a system of equations and to consider whether the lines intersected or not. Second, the teacher refrained from evaluating the students’ answers right away.",57,mtms2013-05-544a,,
"A pattern of interaction called IRE (Cazden 2001) exists in many classrooms: The teacher initiates the pattern by asking a question (I), the student replies to that question (R), and the teacher evaluates the student’s answer (E). It can be very difficult for teachers to depart from this pattern of interaction and avoid evaluating a student immediately after he or she has given a response. However, Jenkins  •	 Naomi: Well, the first pattern in  the table was adding 2. But it was making it bigger, and I needed to go backward. I started subtracting 2 until I got to -14. I did the same with the other pattern but subtracting 3, and I also got to -14.",58,mtms2013-05-544a,,
•	 Martin: I made an equation: 2x - 4  = 3x + 1. I got x = -5.,59,mtms2013-05-544a,,
The teacher summarizes the ideas of the students in this way:,60,mtms2013-05-544a,,
"We have several ideas here. Lilly said that the tables of values do not show the same coordinates for the two equations, and that’s true. Most of you seem to agree that the lines will intersect. But I hear that to find the point of intersection, you had to expand the tables with more values. Naomi wanted to pay attention to the coordinates when x was negative. Akuti and Naomi used the pattern in  the table of values to find a coordinate where the x- and y-values are the same. Martin did something different. He assumed that the y-values had to be the same and created an equation where y1 equals y2. Naomi had -14, and Martin had -5. Let’s try to discuss the meaning of those numbers to answer the big question of whether the lines will intersect or not.",61,mtms2013-05-544a,,
"This example illustrates that a  teacher can use orienting to position several different perspectives about the solutions to a problem. At one level, there were different opinions as to whether the lines intersected or not. Lilly asserted that the lines do not intersect. In contrast, Akuti, Naomi, and Martin said that the lines intersect. At another level, there were different ideas about how to find the point of intersection of the lines. Specifically, Akuti and Naomi used the  table of values, whereas Martin used an algebraic approach.",62,mtms2013-05-544a,,
"Four ideas occurred in the conversation. The teacher gave another student, Pablo, an opportunity to restate what Naomi had said and also gave Naomi the chance to correct Pablo if that restatement did not reflect her ideas. The orienting move happened at the end, when the teacher summarized the different positions about the solution to the problem. This move was important because students could get lost when hearing different ideas. By orienting, the teacher is able to refocus the conversation and identify points of agreement and disagreement. ",63,mtms2013-05-544a,,
"In the example provided, the  teacher did not reach closure about the correct answer to the problem. One can expect that the teacher would achieve some closure afterward, when discussing the meaning of  the values found for the x- and ",64,mtms2013-05-544a,,
