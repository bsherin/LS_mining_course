"Elizabeth D. Gray and Denise Tullier-Holly mMiddle school students need to see  connections between mathematics and the real world. However, they often learn mathematics as a set of distinct topics or separate strands, because a majority of the available textbooks tends to present it that way, and teachers tend to follow the textbooks. According to Principles and Standards for School Mathematics (NCTM 2000), our students should be made aware of mathematical connections explicitly so that the manner in which topics are connected is obvious. McClain (1996) suggests that if teachers offer classroom experiences in which students can see connections, then “the vibrant discipline of mathematics actively engages students in their own learning” (p. 682).

"see these connections, such as those found in art and measurement projects. Kilpatrick, Swafford, and Findell (2001) mention that although there is much beauty in geometry, “there is much pedagogical value in returning geometry to its roots in spatial measure” (p. 281). In particular, applications of building three-dimensional models make several of the abstract concepts of geometry and measurement real and concrete. As students cut and draw and construct, they can explore symmetry, ratios and proportions, and other aspects of geometry and measurement. ",5,mtms2007-10-144a,,
"To find ways to get a seventh- grade class involved in building threedimensional models, an art teacher and a mathematics educator held a brainstorming session to discuss inexpensive, effective, and safe ways to build three-dimensional models. The teachers consulted a local architect who volunteered to work with the students in a planning session.

"This project occurred in a spring semester art class at a university laboratory school. The art teacher met with each class for one hour a week. For this whole-class activity, she wanted her seventh-grade students to build on their knowledge of architecture and geometry by creating a piece of “soft” architecture (an environment using tensile structures or fabric) and use it to display art. The students could learn about construction in a hands-on way and could take more ownership for exhibiting their understanding of the mathematics involved and the art they studied. This threedimensional space was to be built of some pliable material that could later be inflated. The twenty-seven students had previous experience making small inflatable art objects using black plastic bags and 2-inch wide clearplastic tape and inflating them with a hair dryer. However, this project would be a new challenge: to create a room-sized, portable structure with ",10,mtms2007-10-144a,,

"The art teacher discussed the project with the mathematics teacher. They then used another class period for a measurement lesson, after which students created small-scale models of the inflatable. The objective of the lesson was to have the students determine the linear measures, the surface areas, and the volumes for scale models of the original design. The lesson began with a discussion of length, area, and volume and continued with a guided discussion as the students worked in groups of four or five with the previously determined dimensions given in the table (see fig. 3). When the teacher asked the students what size the model should be, they had another discussion about scaling. The students had studied ratios and proportions and were aware that the dimensions of the scale model would have to be in proportion to the dimensions of the inflatable. They were asked the following questions:  (a) What is each linear dimension? (b) What is the area of each face? (c) What is the surface area or sum of  the areas of all the faces?

"Some students wanted the model  to be about the size of an inflated black plastic garbage bag, and others wanted something they could hold in one hand. A decision was finally made to reduce each scale model length to 1/10 of the original linear measurement, because it would be easy to divide the original measurements by ten and because Dienes base-ten blocks could be used to model length, area, and volume. The proposed model design that had been determined with help from the architect contained only linear measures: lengths, widths, and heights. Using the Dienes blocks, the teacher asked the class about the ratio of the length of a side of a unit cube to the length of a side of the large cube, and they noted that it was 1:10. 10  ft.",58,mtms2007-10-144a,,

First, the teacher asked about the ratio of the area of one face of the unit cube to the area of one face of the large cube, and the students noted that it was 1:100. One group remarked that the front face of the design was an irregular hexagon that contained a rectangle and a trapezoid. The students wanted to know the formula for the area of the trapezoid, but one student suggested his own method: Find the area of a 10 ft. × 15 ft. rectangle and subtract the area of the two triangles that fold to form the slant heights on the roof (see fig. 4).

"This student also reminded the others that the slant height could be found by using the Pythagorean theorem. He set up the equation 52 + 52 = x2, where x was the slant height. He discovered that the slant height would be 350. When his calculator showed 7.071067812, the teacher used this opportunity to remind the students about irrational numbers. The slant height could easily be rounded to 7 feet, with no significant deterrent effect on the size of the model or actual structure.

"After four more hour-long sessions of drawing, constructing, cutting, and assembling with duct tape, the structure was inflated using a small 20 in. × 20 in. box fan that was attached to a long tube of the plastic sheeting. The tube was attached to a small 20-inch square hole in one of the sides. To allow entry into the structure, a 5-foot-high slit was made in the opposite side. A 3 ft. × 5 ft. rectangle of plastic was hung over the slit, on the inside, to keep the air from escaping. The inflatable was complete. It was put on display at a community art exhibit where the students and their teachers discussed their project with the public, who had been invited to enter the structure and admire it.

"Connecting measurement and architecture is an exciting way to have students use problem solving in the classroom. During this project, middle school students had the opportunity to see several connections among measurement, geometry, art, and architecture. The students were involved in their learning and in communicating about mathematics. They discussed how to make measurements, calculated areas and volumes, designed a large compass and drew circles, saw a real application of irrational numbers, and used the proportional reasoning required to build scale models. In addition to all the connections with measurement and architecture, an added benefit was their appreciation of the art of Kandinsky. All the students were thoroughly involved in this project and enjoyed seeing the results of their work. They were excited about the project when they examined their scale model next to the inflatable and realized that the proportions of the large Dienes block to the inflatable were the same as those of the small unit block to their scale model.",84,mtms2007-10-144a,,
"Similar projects could have involved building wooden models with construction tools, but that could be expensive, dangerous, and time-consuming.  Using plastic to build an inflatable was inexpensive, safer, and quicker. Other possibilities include constructing a space using fabric, filling a space using foam, suspending ropes to enclose space, or building a structure using Tinker Toys or metal strips or blocks. All these projects would involve reallife mathematics, real-life construction, and rich problem solving. However, this project was our way of weaving the strands of measurement and problem  solving with those of art and architecture so that our students could appreciate the beauty of all these arts.
