"on October 10. Because the metric system is based on powers of ten, October is National Metric Month, October 10 is National Metric Day, and the week encompassing the date 10-10 is National Metric Week. During that week, teachers can schedule metric-related track meets, contests, and scavenger hunts. One year, I included a metric question of the day (“How far can Ms. Dawes throw the shot put?”) on the morning announcements. Students could turn in their guesses all day. At the end of the day, my math class followed Ms. Dawes outside to measure her throw. ",5,mtms2012-12-280a,,

"Let’s start with a random day, April 27, or 4-27. Among other descriptors, this day is wonderfully powerful, relatively prime, and sadly defi cient.",10,mtms2012-12-280a,,
"April 27 is wonderfully powerful because 4 and 27 are both powers (2² and 3³). The 27th of every month is powerful; April 27 becomes wonderfully powerful because both the month and the day are powers. On a super wonderfully powerful day, the year is also a power. For example, 4-27-09 was a super wonderfully powerful day. An awesomely super wonderfully powerful day would occur when the month, day, and year are all powers of the same number, such as will occur on 4-08-16. ",11,mtms2012-12-280a,,
April 27 is relatively prime because  4 and 27 have no common factors other than 1. This label—relatively prime—helps reinforce the fact that relatively prime numbers do not have to be prime numbers themselves. ,12,mtms2012-12-280a,,
"April 27 is sadly deﬁ cient because  both 4 and 27, as defi ned by the Greeks, are defi cient numbers. Defi cient numbers are those for which the sum of their proper factors is less than the number itself. The proper factors of 4 are 1 and 2, and 1 + 2 < 4. Similarly, the proper factors of 27 are 1, 3, and 9, and 1 + 3 + 9 < 27.",13,mtms2012-12-280a,,
"In the same way that the 27th of each month is always powerful, it is also always defi cient. In a manner similar to super wonderfully powerful, a day would be horribly sadly deﬁ cient if the month, day, and year were all defi cient numbers. Defi cient, perfect, and abundant numbers and their study make great enrichment topics because they help students become ﬂ uent in basic facts, prime numbers, addition, and factoring.

Teachers can build an interest in numbers (and possibly mathematics itself ) in many ways. A teacher can begin each day by introducing the date and a fun fact to students. One way is to write a note at the top of the board:,17,mtms2012-12-280a,,
"Today is November 10, 11-10—a binary day ",18,mtms2012-12-280a,,
"A short description of the binary number system and its application to computers could follow, or teachers in lower grades could simply explain that a binary number uses only ones and zeroes. An enrichment idea would be to challenge students to determine how many binary days occur in the present month or in each year. By  asking students to justify why their list is complete, they begin to develop the habit of mind of reasoning and proof as well as making sense, which are equally important Process Standards (NCTM 2000) and Practice Standards (CCSSI 2010).",19,mtms2012-12-280a,,
"Many elementary teachers already  use dates to build number sense by saying, “Today is May 20. What can you tell me about the number 20?” Students reply that 20 is— 1.  equal to 4 × 5; 2.  the quotient when 100 is divided  by 5;  3.  a two-digit number; and 4.  equal to 14 + 6. ",20,mtms2012-12-280a,,
Adding “every day is mathematical” to this activity focuses on vocabulary and multiple numbers rather than just one instance. ,21,mtms2012-12-280a,,
"Instead of writing a statement on  the board, middle school teachers could put a white board just outside their room every day with a statement about the day (without the explanation). This would involve more students, possibly the entire school, in the mathematical activity. Imagine how important your students will feel when they are able to tell their friends or another teacher why May 13 is a super prime day.",22,mtms2012-12-280a,,
Teachers can also use the mathematical-ness of a day as a way to involve students in productive group work. They can tell their students that ,23,mtms2012-12-280a,,

This year? • Are there any triply abundant days? • How many triply abundant days have there been since you were born? 6 is a perfect number because the sum of its proper factors equals the number itself (1 + 2 + 3 = 6). Then students can be asked to fi nd the next perfect number or the next two perfect numbers. Perfect numbers can easily be found by checking the Internet, but if students are in a group, working on the problem by hand, every student will be practicing multiplication facts, using factoring, and completing addition. At the same time, the assignment will proceed quickly if all group members work on different numbers as compared to one or two students doing the work while others watch, as sometimes occurs with group work. ",25,mtms2012-12-280a,,
"Problem-solving skills can be  developed by showing students that every day is mathematical. For abundant numbers, the sum of their proper factors is greater than the number itself. A few of the smaller abundant numbers are 12, 18, 24, and 30. At this point, students can be asked, “Are all abundant numbers multiples of 6?” or “Are all multiples of 6 abundant numbers?” The whole class can rejoice if one student points out that 20 is an abundant number and it is not a multiple of 6; it was just conveniently omitted from the fi rst list.",26,mtms2012-12-280a,,
"Questions such as these are also great ways to differentiate instruction. A teacher can ask a struggling student, “If you add defi cient numbers, will the answer always be a defi cient number?” The answer is pretty straightforward because 5 and 7 are both defi cient numbers, but the sum, 12, is an abundant number. At the same time, a gifted student can be asked to fi nd an odd abundant number. This is quite a challenge because there is only one odd abundant number that is less than 1000.",27,mtms2012-12-280a,,
Using brainteasers is another way to embed mathematics. I recommend that all teachers routinely use brainteasers to develop critical thinking (Barger 2005). Examples include these: • •  the day (4) is a perfect square; the day (4) and the month (7)  @MtMs_at_nctM,28,mtms2012-12-280a,,

"For many students, naming special days makes this activity fun, but how can the teacher be sure that the name is correct? It does not matter. There is no mathematically assigned defi nition to days; these defi nitions can be made up on the spot. For example, I have used the term repeaters to describe a day such as 11-11-11. There is no right or wrong name, as long as the mathematical terms are used correctly. Students also enjoy making up names.",31,mtms2012-12-280a,,
"When naming a day, the teacher can consider the day alone; the day and the month; or the day, the month, and the year. In some situations, the hour and minute can be included. July 4, 2013, will be a perfect-square day because— combine to be a relatively prime day; and the day, month, and year (4-72013) produce a triply relatively prime day.",32,mtms2012-12-280a,,
"A teacher can use either the full fourdigit year or only the last two digits. For example, August 12, 2004, was a triple-multiple-of-4 day (this usage adds a divisibility rule to the benefi t of the activity). However, 12-12-2006 was not a triple-multiple-of-6 day even though 12-12-06 was. Similarly, leading zeroes can be used, depending on whether they provide an interesting date. When putting numbers together, a teacher should not use the month and the year solely because students will then not be naming a day.",33,mtms2012-12-280a,,
"On November 2, 2011, a former  student left me a voicemail commenting on the palindromic nature of that day in November. I had viewed all the fi rst nine days of 2011 as palindromes because I was ignoring the leading zero associated with the day. To me, 11-1-11, 11-2-11, 11-3-11, . . . , 11-9-11 all read the same both ways. But my student, Tony, had noticed that 11-02-2011, using the entire year and the leading zero, remained a palindrome. Thinking back, I might have called that day perfectly palindromic or wonderfully completely palindromic in a year that contained many palindromes. Once a format is agreed on, a teacher can ask this enrichment question, “How many palindrome days occurred in 2011?”",34,mtms2012-12-280a,,

"(a) Triangular numbers (b) Pentagonal numbers (c) Hexagonal numbers (d) Octagonal numbers awesomely, super, or totally can be used. A teacher does not have to follow a naming convention. Adjectives can refer to a day only or a month and a day. Two descriptors can be used with the month, day, and year. For instance, September 25, 2016, could be triply perfectly square or awesomely triply perfectly square or simply super perfectly square. A contest can be designed to see in how many different ways a single day could be named.",39,mtms2012-12-280a,,
"A number of mathematical terms can apply to a day; however, it is not an exhaustive list. A day can be odd or even, prime, relatively prime, a composite, a perfect square, or a cube. Other examples include a power, a binary number, a tertiary number, a palindrome, a consecutive prime, a consecutive number, a consecutive multiple, a decreasing consecutive number, a Fibonacci number, a figurate number, a multiple, an arithmetic  fact, and a repeater. For instance,  October 6 is a double triangular number because 10 and 6 are both triangular numbers. (See fig. 2 for more figurate numbers.) May 8, 2013, will be a triply consecutive Fibonacci day because 5, 8, and 13 are consecutive Fibonacci numbers. January 13, 2013, will be a multiplication fact day because 1 × 13 = 13. March 10, 2013, will be an addition fact day because 3 + 10 = 13. Do not forget about Pythagorean triples, such as 3-4-5, 6-8-10, or  5-12-13. ",40,mtms2012-12-280a,,

"In addition to adding a little fun to the lesson, this project is a delightful way to build a mathematical climate in the classroom and in the school community. Describing every day as mathematical— 1.  creates a classroom focused on  reasoning and sense making and encourages students to think like mathematicians. When asked why a day is special, students look for mathematical properties of numbers and explain why they named the day in that way.  2.  encourages and improves the mathematical discourse in the classroom. Students question one another about the meaning that is assigned to a term, and then often use that language to tell their parents, friends, brothers, and sisters about the day. This language use gives students the opportunity to be experts about this math topic. 3.  allows the teacher to infuse some  mathematical history into the class. For instance, the abundant, perfect, and deficient numbers described earlier provide an example of math history that is not usually present in today’s middle school classrooms.

"Many parents who listen to the radio on the way to work will occasionally hear something mathematical about a day, but the student riding in the car will be able to describe something mathematical about every day. ",44,mtms2012-12-280a,,
"A teacher can infuse the idea of   every day being mathematical in multiple ways. In addition to the ones listed earlier, a teacher could assign each school day of a month to a student and make him or her the student of the day. Every student can participate. Every student can name a day as odd or even. The idea is self-differentiating because students can bring their own level of mathematical knowledge as well as their own creativity to the task. Advanced students should be challenged to find unique names for their days or offer at least three different names for their days to make the activity meaningful and useful to them.",45,mtms2012-12-280a,,
"At times, the mathematical-ness of the day could be a question for an exit slip. An explanation of why a day can be named in a certain way could be used as a bell ringer at the beginning of class. However, motivation is the reason for implementing the ideas described here. The idea that every day is mathematical will set a classroom apart from all other classes that students have attended. It is subjective and appropriate for all students. It gives students something to talk about with their parents when they are asked what they learned at school that day. I include something mathematical about the day every time I record a new voicemail message once a week. (You can check by calling 816.235.5655 at 3:00 a.m. when I am not in the office.)

Once students (and teachers, administrators, and parents) begin thinking about numbers in this way, they can extend the thought to numbers in other settings.
