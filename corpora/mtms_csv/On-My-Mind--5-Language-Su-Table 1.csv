9,On My Mind: 5 Language Substitutions When Teaching Fractions,"An important way to help students focus on the meaning of fractions is to be very intentional about the language that is used. Here are 5 basic but important substitutions that can potentially help students better understand fractions.  1. use partitioning (rather than dividing) When we illustrate parts of a whole, as shown in ﬁ gure 1, we are partition",9,On My Mind: 5 Language Substitutions When Teaching Fractions

Emphasize that students are fi nding parts; therefore, they are partitioning.  2. eMploy “ths” (rather than “over”)",10,On My Mind: 5 Language Substitutions When Teaching Fractions
11,On My Mind: 5 Language Substitutions When Teaching Fractions,"How do you say 3/8? Saying 3-eighths, rather than 3 over 8, communicates to students that the fraction represents a single value (and not two whole numbers). (Using the “ths” form is also important for decimal fractions: Say “5-tenths” when reading .5, rather than “point 5,” to reinforce the place value’s meaning.) Imagine that you are measuring a distance in miles. You can count, or iterate, 1-eighth, 2-eighths, 3-eighths, . . . , up to 8-eighths to total one mile. This language reinforces the fact that the numerator tells how many parts and that the denominator tells the size of the parts. Stating fractions correctly (using “ths”) and using iterating addresses the scenarios listed here. ",11,On My Mind: 5 Language Substitutions When Teaching Fractions

14,On My Mind: 5 Language Substitutions When Teaching Fractions,"Consider the difference in a student hearing “1 over 4 times 2” versus “1-fourth of 2.” The latter connects to the meaning of multiplication, finding a part of 2; hence, it is a smaller answer. The phrase 1-fourth of 2 can be connected to 1-fourth times 2, and students will understand why multiplication can result in a fraction that is smaller than either or both of the initial fractions. ",14,On My Mind: 5 Language Substitutions When Teaching Fractions
15,On My Mind: 5 Language Substitutions When Teaching Fractions,"Iterating, or counting parts, can also  be used to develop an understanding of division of fractions, which is one of the least understood algorithms in mathematics. For example, the measurement interpretation of 4 ÷ 1/8 is “How many eighths are in 4?” Partition the 4 wholes into eighths and then iterate (emphasizing the eighths as you read), 1-eighth, 2-eighths, . . . , 32-eighths. We can also take a shortcut if we consider that there are 8-eighths in a whole, or 32-eighths in 4 wholes. Notice that this approach of counting fractional parts (the denominator) is how one can begin to see why we multiply by the denominator in the standard algorithm for division of fractions and why it works (Van de Walle, Karp, and Bay-Williams 2013). Using “ths” for fractions and emphasizing iterating can potentially help more students understand division of fractions, as well as other operations with rational numbers.",15,On My Mind: 5 Language Substitutions When Teaching Fractions
16,On My Mind: 5 Language Substitutions When Teaching Fractions,3. accept siMpliFying (rather than reducing),16,On My Mind: 5 Language Substitutions When Teaching Fractions
17,On My Mind: 5 Language Substitutions When Teaching Fractions,"A fraction such as 20/30 can be written in infinitely many equivalent forms. The fraction form is the one in which it is partitioned into the fewest sections. For 20/30, the simplest form is 2/3. This form is simplified but not reduced. The term reduced suggests that the fraction changed size, which can reinforce a common misconception. The attempt to delete the term reduce from fraction instruction has been around for years (you will not  find this term in any recent standards, textbooks, or publications), but it still finds its way into fraction operation instruction.  4. call theM Fractions (rather than iMproper Fractions)",17,On My Mind: 5 Language Substitutions When Teaching Fractions
18,On My Mind: 5 Language Substitutions When Teaching Fractions,"Fractions include numbers such as 3/2 and 18/5. These fractions are greater than 1 and, like other numbers, have many equivalent forms. Referring to these fractions as improper might lead students to think that this form is less desirable than a mixed number. However, in computation and in algebra, the improper version is often preferred. In fact, by the end of seventh grade, students are to have a “unified understanding of number” (CCSSI 2010, p. 46), which includes selecting the most appropriate form of a fraction, given the situation. Why not just call them fractions?  5. accept equivalent ForMs",18,On My Mind: 5 Language Substitutions When Teaching Fractions
19,On My Mind: 5 Language Substitutions When Teaching Fractions,"The last two sections have used the term equivalent because equivalency is a critical idea in mathematics (CCSSI 2010; NCTM 2000). Instructions often ask students to solve mathematics problems and leave the answer in the simplest form. We might think of these tasks as two parts: (1) Find a correct answer and (2) write an equivalent, simplified fraction, where appropriate. If we mark answers as wrong when they are actually correct (just not simplified), students may not connect that the fractions are in fact equivalent. In discussing answers, reinforce the equivalent ways that the answer might be written. ",19,On My Mind: 5 Language Substitutions When Teaching Fractions
20,On My Mind: 5 Language Substitutions When Teaching Fractions,"Equivalent fraction forms involve  more than students’ answers; these forms also speak to how students solve a problem. Mathematically proficient students recognize equivalent forms of numbers and use the form that is the most convenient for the operation at hand. For example, in solving if students know that 14/4, 7/2, 3 2/4, and 3.5 are equivalent, they can work flexibly and efficiently when finding the sum.",20,On My Mind: 5 Language Substitutions When Teaching Fractions

22,On My Mind: 5 Language Substitutions When Teaching Fractions,"Using precise language, in particular, language that focuses on the meaning of fractions and on equivalence, can play an important role in helping students understand fractions and use them in efficient and accurate ways. Using this language with students in our discussions of fractions will help them understand fraction operations and representations at the level that we expect to see in mathematically proficient students.
