84,Readers Write  November 2013,readers write letters from our readers illUMinating PRoPoRtions: a VaRiation With VaRiaBles,84,Readers Write  November 2013
85,Readers Write  November 2013,"When reading the interesting  article “Strip Diagrams: Illuminating Proportions” by Jessica Cohen in the May 2013 issue (vol. 18, no. 9, pp. 536-42; http://www.nctm.org/ publications/article.aspx?id=36902), I could see that using variables with strip diagrams would create a flexible problem-solving strategy. When using a variable, a student can directly translate the story line of the problem into an equation and still see the ratio among the quantities. The following are solutions for the problems in the article. Each solution begins by using the strip diagram shown in the article. ",85,Readers Write  November 2013
86,Readers Write  November 2013,"The Cats and Dogs problem was  presented first:   An animal shelter has 5 cats for every 6 dogs. If the shelter has  48 dogs, how many cats must it have? ",86,Readers Write  November 2013
87,Readers Write  November 2013,"See the diagram in figure 1a. Solving the problem depends on finding how many animals are represented by each box in the strip diagram. Use a variable to represent this unknown number. See figure 1b, which contains the variables. The number of cats is 5x; the number of dogs is 6x. Since the number of  dogs is 48, 6x = 48, and therefore  x = 8. Writing 8 in each box of the strip diagram easily leads to the solution to the problem.",87,Readers Write  November 2013
88,Readers Write  November 2013,The Gus and Ike Running Problem was explored next: ,88,Readers Write  November 2013
89,Readers Write  November 2013,"Readers are encouraged to share their thoughts. Please e-mail letters to  mtms@nctm.org, type Readers Write in the message line, and copy the letter to all authors if responding to an article.",89,Readers Write  November 2013
90,Readers Write  November 2013," Gus’s and Ike’s combined running distance this week was 48 miles. If Gus ran three times as far as Ike, how many miles did Ike run? ",90,Readers Write  November 2013
91,Readers Write  November 2013,"Figure 1d’s diagram shows that with 3x and 7x representing the numbers of cars, the story line of the problem can be translated into an equation:",91,Readers Write  November 2013
92,Readers Write  November 2013,"The diagram in figure 1c shows that Ike ran x miles and that Gus ran 3x miles. Since the combined distance was 48 miles, x + 3x = 48, and x = 6. Substituting 6 for x in the diagram gives the solution.",92,Readers Write  November 2013
93,Readers Write  November 2013,Gus and Ike appear again in the ,93,Readers Write  November 2013
94,Readers Write  November 2013,"Car problem:   Gus and Ike are playing with  toy cars. The ratio of Gus’s cars  to Ike’s cars is 7 to 3. Gus gives  Ike 14 cars, so now they each  have the same number of cars. How many cars do they each  have now?  7x – 14 = 3x + 14  x = 7",94,Readers Write  November 2013
95,Readers Write  November 2013,"Again, 7 can replace x in the strip diagram to find the solution.",95,Readers Write  November 2013
96,Readers Write  November 2013,"In each of these solutions, the strip  diagram clearly represents the ratio while the equation clearly models the story. Taken together, these strategies provide students with tools for making sense of many different kinds of proportion problems.",96,Readers Write  November 2013
