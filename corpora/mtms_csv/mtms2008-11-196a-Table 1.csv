Kristen A. Lampe and Linda Uselmann,3,mtms2008-11-196a,,
"Kristen A. Lampe, klampe@cc.edu, is an associate professor of mathematics at Carroll College in Waukesha, Wisconsin. She teaches a wide variety of mathematics courses, including many for preservice teachers. Linda Uselmann, luselmann@edgewood.edu, has been teaching mathematics to preservice teachers in Madison, Wisconsin, since 1996. She is on the faculty at Edgewood College, where she teaches content and methods courses, as well as various courses for returning adults.",4,mtms2008-11-196a,,
wWhat is a good mathematics problem? ,5,mtms2008-11-196a,,
"What is a good mathematics problem for students at a particular grade level? How can I make mathematics interesting to students and fun? Preservice teachers explored these questions as they participated in a pen pal project with fifth and sixth graders. The teachers presented the middle schoolers with custom-made, meaningful mathematics problems. The students honed their communication skills and received personalized feedback about their learning. Along the way, many became more motivated by mathematics than they had been, and some, stimulated by the interaction with college students, began thinking about the future and college. ",6,mtms2008-11-196a,,
"The pen pal project began as part  of a grant funded by the Networking Project for the Improvement of Mathematics Education (Thompson and Wilsman 2004). Instructors from two Wisconsin colleges conducted pen pal projects within courses taken by elementary education majors (a content course and a methods course). The goals of the projects were to (1) provide middle school students with a new forum to explore problem solving and receive personalized feedback, (2) build connections between the college faculty and area elementary teachers who employed the NCTM’s Standards in their classrooms, (3) give elementary education majors an opportunity to interact on a more personal level with students, and (4) reinforce to these elementary education majors the emphasis on problem solving in the Standards (NCTM 2000).",7,mtms2008-11-196a,,
"We got in touch with teachers in  the area who employed the Standards in their classrooms because the environment would lend itself to incorporating the pen pal project as part of regular mathematics instruction. Classroom teachers could easily use this experience as a summary assessment, ",8,mtms2008-11-196a,,

"Dear _____________,",10,mtms2008-11-196a,,
"My name is ________________. I am 21 years old and a senior at   ________________College. I am studying to be a teacher so that I can teach kids just like you someday. I am really looking forward to writing to you and doing math with you. I have learned a lot of math in school here, and our class right now teaches us about teaching math. ",11,mtms2008-11-196a,,
"I have a job where I work with very small kids, in preschool. We teach  them colors and shapes and things like that. I haven’t talked with a fifth grader in a while. I have two little sisters, but they are older now. Both of them are in high school.",12,mtms2008-11-196a,,
"I live in an apartment here in Madison with two roommates and a cat. The cat’s name is Buttons, and she’s five years old. She’s really warm and cuddly during the winter. Do you have any pets? I really like to go biking in the summer and downhill skiing in the winter. Sometimes I watch sports on TV, mostly basketball. What kinds of sports do you like? ",13,mtms2008-11-196a,,
It will be great to get your letter. I think it will be fun being pen pals. Write soon!,14,mtms2008-11-196a,,

the Pen PAL Process,16,mtms2008-11-196a,,
"The pen pal project had three  components:  1.  The college students would exchange letters of introduction with one or two pen pals.  2.  Two sets of problems would be written by the college students, solved by the younger students, and assessed by the college students.",17,mtms2008-11-196a,,
3.  The project would conclude with a face-to-face meeting of the pen pals. ,18,mtms2008-11-196a,,
"Each component offered many learning opportunities for both collegelevel and grade-school participants, and the feedback was overwhelmingly positive.",19,mtms2008-11-196a,,
"The letters of introduction drew out issues that the college students had not considered. “How do I sign  my name?” “My pen pal wants a picture of me; what do I do?” “My pen pal wants my e-mail address. Can I give it to her?” were some of the questions that resulted from this exchange (see fig. 1). It was made clear that contact was to be limited to the project and that no additional contact information was to be exchanged, for the safety of the middle school students. The college students had no more information about their pen pals than they would, for instance, in a practicum situation. ",20,mtms2008-11-196a,,
"This group of college students  found themselves thinking more like teachers than students. It was no longer appropriate, for instance, to admit that mathematics was not one’s strong suit. The letters sent from the middle schoolers were colorful and charming (see fig. 2). These letters also enabled the college students to tailor their problems to their pen pals’ interests, which gave them a much-needed starting point.",21,mtms2008-11-196a,,
"In the week after receiving their  student letters, the preservice teachers prepared their first round of problems. They referenced the reform and standard textbooks in the college libraries, surfed the NCTM’s Web site, located other Web sites containing mathematics problems for inspiration, and added their own creativity. Some found it difficult to write a problem that could be solved in more than one way. As they developed their problems, they also generated ",22,mtms2008-11-196a,,

"Dear Mathematician, ",25,mtms2008-11-196a,,
Your pen pal is interested in your comments about the problem you solved. Please answer the questions below.,26,mtms2008-11-196a,,
What is your name?,27,mtms2008-11-196a,,
"Was the problem too easy, too hard, or just right?",28,mtms2008-11-196a,,
Was the problem easy enough to read? Did you understand what you were asked to do?,29,mtms2008-11-196a,,
What was your favorite part about the problem?,30,mtms2008-11-196a,,
"Was there anything you disliked about the problem? possible solutions, which made them think about how the younger students might handle the mathematics. ",31,mtms2008-11-196a,,
"The preservice teachers were not  told of their pen pals’ strengths or weaknesses as mathematics students or about any special education needs. We wanted to respect confidentiality regarding the middle schoolers’ assessments and begin the project without any preconceptions about abilities. The college faculty instructor and the participating classroom teacher worked together to ensure that the first round of problems was at the appropriate level for each student. The preservice teachers were asked to rework their problems when necessary to accommodate the middle school students’ needs and allow them to have a challenging, but not overwhelming, learning experience. Many of the preservice teachers learned quite a bit about designing problems before their pen pals attempted the mathematics.",32,mtms2008-11-196a,,
"The middle schoolers solved the problems during the next two weeks. Some class time normally devoted to problem solving was spent working on the solutions; at other times, the solutions were completed as a combination in-class activity and homework assignment. The students also provided feedback about their perception of the problem’s difficulty. See figure 3 for the form used to gather feedback. The preservice teachers found these comments helpful, which helped them assess their mathematics problems and produce the second round. During class meetings, when comparing their pen pal problems with the solutions, the preservice teachers commented repeatedly about the diverse skill levels they observed. ",33,mtms2008-11-196a,,
"In the next step, the preservice  teachers performed two assessments. The first assessment was an evaluation of the solution, with commentary. For this, we modified a rubric found in Wisconsin’s Planning Curriculum in Mathematics, the Department of ",34,mtms2008-11-196a,,
"Public Instruction curriculum guide (Grunow 2001). The second was a self-assessment of the problem they had written (see fig. 4). Both assessment tools were given to the preservice teachers ahead of time. To assess the middle schoolers, we wanted the preservice teachers to think about what makes a good solution. We also worked with them to ensure that their comments were fair, correct, and appropriately worded. The goal was for the middle school students to benefit from reading the comments and begin the second problem armed with new ideas and approaches as well as confidence that they were on the right track. The classroom teachers helped make sure the middle schoolers understood the feedback they received from  the preservice teachers. For the self- critique, the preservice teachers reflected on the changes they would make and what they learned during the process of writing and evaluating their problem.",35,mtms2008-11-196a,,
"Once these assessments were  completed, a second set of problems was developed and sent to the pen pals over the next two weeks. In all, this second set of problems reflected a much better understanding on the part of the preservice teachers about the appropriate level of mathematics (especially for their particular middle school pen pal) and the components of a good mathematics problem. ",36,mtms2008-11-196a,,
"Figures 5 and 6 contain problems  and the sixth-grade pen pal’s solutions. In the self-evaluation for the first problem (fig. 5), the preservice teacher noted, “I probably could have made it a little more difficult, although he couldn’t find one of the answers. But, I think maybe he just didn’t have time.” The student’s solution was given the second-highest rating. The student commented, “What I found most interesting about my problems was that she did a problem with basketball because she knew I liked basketball.” The second example ",37,mtms2008-11-196a,,

"Fig. 6 The difficulty level of the problem increased, following feedback from the middle school student.",53,mtms2008-11-196a,,
"(fig. 6) is a second problem between another preservice teacher and her pen pal. Note here that the problem is at a higher level than many sixthgrade problems, in response to her pen pal’s comments after the first task. The preservice teacher noted that the student used an algebraic method to find the number of minutes with equal charges and another method to determine whether to add or subtract a minute to get the answer to the problem. To clarify the problem, the preservice teacher would reword it: “How many minutes of long distance will your family need to use in one month to make plan B less expensive than plan A?” The student reported finding this problem challenging but solved it without help, thereby earning the highest ranking.",54,mtms2008-11-196a,,
"There were variations in the faceto-face meetings that completed the project. In some cases, the middle  school students visited the college; in other instances, the preservice teachers met the students in their classrooms. At this meeting, the pen pals discussed the second problem assessments. The face-to-face interaction was a valuable opportunity to hear each person’s thoughts on both problems and their solutions. Students who successfully solved their problems explored them further. Those who were unsuccessful were given help to understand and solve the problems. Food and games added an air of festivity to this final meeting.  oPPortUnities AboUnd",55,mtms2008-11-196a,,
"The pen pal project was rewarding to all participants. We saw positive mathematical attitudes displayed by the middle school students. In addition, the next generation of elementary teachers was learning how to positively affect the mathematical  learning of the students with whom they worked.",56,mtms2008-11-196a,,
"The middle school students looked  forward to working with the preservice teachers. They received one-onone personal attention and feedback and were able to experience mathematics tailored to their interests and particular level, not always possible in a regular classroom setting. The majority of the middle schoolers demonstrated greater-than-usual effort in constructing their solutions, trying more avenues and methods to reach a coherent solution rather than simply guessing or giving up. They were obligated to communicate mathematically, in writing, with someone who was not present during the problem-solving process, which many found to be a challenging new learning experience. Meeting personally with preservice teachers was a treat and was the high point of the project for them. The project sparked an interest in college in some students who had not been thinking in that direction. Many felt that they had gained a mathematical mentor, if only for a brief time. ",57,mtms2008-11-196a,,
"The classroom teachers benefited from the process, as well. Mathematics class became fun; one teacher said that she had “never seen the students so motivated to solve mathematics problems.” Teachers learned about their students’ interests and motivations as they watched them interact with their pen pals. They also garnered a library of problems to be used with future classes. ",58,mtms2008-11-196a,,
"Our preservice teachers made  connections with students in a quasiteaching capacity, which allowed them to put their knowledge into practice. For some, using a rubric and creating mathematics problems were new experiences. Further, student solutions varied from meticulous to muddled to missing, which provided additional learning experiences for the preservice teachers. Some of them were surprised by the sophistication of the solutions  they saw. Others reflected on some of the students’ lack of effort: “It was very frustrating to me because I worked hard to create the problems, and she did not seem to care about doing them.” Many preservice teachers experienced a degree of success that they were not expecting during the pen pal project, which was a boost to their mathematical confidence. Some felt a new connection to mathematics teaching. Our preservice teachers found this project extremely salient to their goals, and they took it seriously. They made an extra effort to be sure that their work was high quality and on time for the sake of the middle school students. As one preservice teacher commented, “I found it interesting to create the problem for a real student . . . this project was ‘hands on’ and I really enjoyed that.” We had 100 percent participation in each aspect of this project from the preservice teachers. ",59,mtms2008-11-196a,,
"In an extreme case, two students who dropped the course continued to write problems for their pen pals and came to the face-to-face meeting, because they did not want to let their pen pals down. In our role as college faculty, we found the interactions with the classroom teachers inspiring. Connecting with these exemplary teachers let us witness reform mathematics in action. We also discovered a new source of student work examples.",60,mtms2008-11-196a,,
"Through this project, we also connected more closely with our college students. Areas of both weakness and interest were highlighted, which lead to various course modifications. We gained a better understanding of our teaching candidates’ mathematical abilities beyond what the theoretical course assignments had provided. ",61,mtms2008-11-196a,,
"The projects presented a wonderful  avenue for connections in all direc- tions. We hope that other college instructors and classroom teachers will seek each other out to try this activity. It fits well into Standards-based classrooms as well as within the constraints of the college semester. All parties are given an opportunity to put problem solving, communication, and assessment into action in a meaningful way.",62,mtms2008-11-196a,,
