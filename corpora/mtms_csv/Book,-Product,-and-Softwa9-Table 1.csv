This volume contains suggestions to help plan and design formative assessments appropriate for middle school math teachers.",,
6,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (November 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Chapter 5, Classroom-Based Formative Assessments: Guiding Teaching and Learning, provides specific evidence supporting the use of daily formative assessment in the classroom to guide the teaching and learning of students. The recommendations for using an observation form, interviewing students, and incorporating planned hinge questions and exit slips were put into action during a unit of study about linear functions in secondary mathematics. The observation forms documented evidence of mathematics content, mathematical practices, and the extent of student engagement in the classroom throughout the week. Interviewers collected data on conceptual understanding and procedural fluency and developed strategies. The hinge questions helped guide instruction and provide evidence as to whether students were ready for the next content. The exit tasks supplied evidence of what students actually learned during the classroom experience.",,

13,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (November 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","This straightforward, utilitarian book looks at how proportional reasoning is built throughout the Kgrade 8 spectrum and is intended for use by teachers, math coaches, and preservice teachers.",,
14,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (November 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","The book begins by describing what proportional reasoning is, how it connects with Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSM) content and practice standards as well as with NCTMs Principles to Actions: Ensuring Mathematics Success for All. Thereafter, it is organized into two parts: developing the foundations of proportional reasoning (Kgrade 2) and focusing on proportional reasoning (grades 38). A separate chapter devoted to each grade identifies the related CCSSM domains and standards, key underlying ideas, descriptions of activities, and suggested questions. The index is arranged in two ways: the typical fashion and by CCSSM content and practice strands.",,
15,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (November 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Classroom teachers will find this book especially useful for understanding how proportional reasoning relates to the specific CCSSM they teach, finding useful activities to incorporate into their practice, and understanding proportional reasoning in adjacent grades. The book will benefit teachers, preservice teachers, and math coaches as a way of understanding the entire arc of proportional reasoning throughout the Kgrade 8 years.",,
16,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (November 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","The books notable strengths are the connections it makes between the early grades and the development of proportional reasoning, the clarity of the writing and organization, and the variety of models it uses to illustrate ideas. Notably absent are a further reading section for each chapter and any consideration of the use of various online or computer- or tablet-based dynamic tools for building proportional reasoning. Nevertheless, Building Proportional Reasoning across Grades and Math Strands would be a useful purchase for teachers, math coaches, preservice teachers, and professional development libraries.",,

22,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (November 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","This practitioner-friendly book includes a series of activities for students ages 513 collected from various countries around the world. The open-ended activities include multiple entry points and promote student-controlled discourse as students reason, argue, and make predictions about mathematics. Extensions are often provided for students who finish early or need an additional challenge.",,
23,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (November 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","The activities assume quite a bit of background knowledge that students may or may not have. It might have been useful to include a prior knowledge section at the start of each lesson so teachers would understand what knowledge is assumed or needed for each lesson. Vocabulary is seldom a focus in these activities, which is worrisome, especially for classes that include English language learners. Insufficient examples of teacher questioning are included in the lessons, so novice teachers may need more support in understanding what types of questions to ask during each activity. Technology is also insufficiently incorporated. Electronic files of the activities are available as an online supplement. However, they cannot be edited, making it difficult for teachers to change and adapt the materials. As with any educational resource, teachers must take a critical eye to the activities presented in this book to adapt and modify them as necessary to best meet the needs of their unique students.",,

It is a necessary read for anyone in the field of mathematics professional development (PD) or mathematics teacher content knowledge research. The Problem-Solving Cycle (PSC) details a research-based way to assist teachers with changing mathematical instructional practices and increasing content knowledge to effectively promote students mathematical thinking and increase student achievement. Each workshop centers on a rich mathematical problem that participants work through, develop a lesson for, teach to their students, and then debrief in their subsequent PD sessions. These activities are what the PSC are built on; through them, mathematical knowledge is built, and teacher change occurs.",,
30,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (November 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","The role of video in the PSC is relevant and promotes community within a professional development program. Videos enable teachers to grow in their own practice, and in turn create teacher leaders, thus permitting movement into the Mathematics Leaders Preparation (MLP) model that supports growing teachers into leaders within one framework. This allows the model to not only support teachers but also prepare them to lead the PSC workshops.",,
31,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (November 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","The MLP model fosters in-depth discussions and modeling followed by reflection. It uses rehearsals and simulations with the teachers, self-reflection, and individualized coaching to provide opportunities for teachers to grow in their practice. The MLP model offers details on selecting video clips as a teacher versus selecting video clips as a facilitator.",,
32,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (November 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","The continuum of the PSC model and MLP model sets forth a strategy to allow teachers and schools to engage in PD effectively, in not only mathematics but also other content areas. Through the use of video to analyze ones practice and student thinking, the effects of that practice impact the participants mathematics knowledge, their instructional practices, and the mathematics achievement of their students. Using the two models together enables schools and teachers to sustain professional development at their campus.",,

This book fully meets its promise of making the mathematical practices more accessible to elementary teachers. For each of the eight practices, the author presents goals that fully describe the intent and implementation of the practices. In doing so, the author includes a wonderfully helpful chart relating each of the subgoals that help to unpack each practice. The chart describes what a teacher might observe students doing and might hear students saying while engaged in a particular mathematical practice. In addition, the chart provides tips to help teachers decide what to do as they observe student actions.",,
41,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (November 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","For each mathematical practice, the author gives an example of a mathematical task and a classroom vignette to make the mathematical practice come alive.

42,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (November 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","This is an outstanding book that elementary school teachers and teacher educators will find useful. It is practical, engaging, and beneficial in helping mathematics educators better understand and implement the Common Cores mathematical practices in the classroom. The author is transparent and honest in sharing the challenges and exciting results that can be experienced when working with students to develop these mathematical practices.

Decimal operations, proportional reasoning, integer operations, and scientific notation are just a few of the topics addressed. The table of contents is organized by misconception, making the book easy to navigate. The author offers advice on forty-three misconceptions.",,
49,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (November 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Even though it is packed with information, this is not a book you would necessarily want to read cover to cover. Instead, one of the books strengths lies in its organizational structure. Teachers can easily navigate to relevant topics because each misconception section is organized and presented in the same way: grade level, sample question, likely student response, explanation of misconception, what teachers can do, and research notes. The author offers a wide range of potential solutions to correct each misconception. He does not limit his suggestions to traditional or hands-on approaches, and the research connections are valuable when determining next steps for the classroom.",,
50,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (November 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","One drawback of the book is that the author tends to write formally, so readers occasionally may have to read sections more than once to decipher what the author was attempting to convey. Despite that, the book offers a wealth of information that would be good for Kgrade 12 teachers to have at their disposal.",,

It begins with an introduction about why number talks are so important for helping students make sense of mathematics, ideas for how to start using them, and Guiding Principles for Enacting Number Talks. Chapters 47 provide ideas for Number Talks in subtraction, multiplication, addition, and division. Each chapter identifies strategies that students might use for the given operation and gives examples, ideas for choosing problems that invite the given strategy, and suggested discussion questions. Although ideas for applying the strategies to decimals and fractions are included throughout these chapters, the book also includes a chapter on Making Sense of Fractions (and Decimals and Percent) with ideas for number talks, such as Fractions on a Number Line and Reasoning about Division of Fractions.

65,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (November 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","The layout of the workbook lends itself to many different uses. The most basic would be to give a single analogy as a Problem of the Day. Another option is to run a few pages of the workbook (it has three or four analogies per page) to keep in a Fast Finishers folder for students who finish a task or assignment early. Some of the tougher analogies can be used for a class or grade level Math Challenge/Competition. One final suggestion is to select several analogies on the same topic (e.g., unit rates) and have students solve them as a learning-station activity. I highly recommend the workbook.",,
