"Algebra prediction  can  look  like  and  how  it  can  serve  as  a building block for the development of students’ reasoning abilities. Second, we will suggest some ideas to teachers that promote reasoning when prediction is incorporated in mathematics lessons. ",61,mtms2007-02-294a,,
"Prediction in State Standards wHILE  rEVIEwING  THIrTY-FIVE  K–8  STATE mathematics  standards,  we  found  that  every  state under review had at least one grade-level expectation pertaining to prediction in their content strands (Kim and Kasmer 2006). In addition, prediction was the most frequent grade-level expectation among all  aspects of reasoning. Examples of prediction expectations  from  state  standards  presented  in  table  1 illustrate  the  variety  of  occurrences  across  states, across content areas, and across grades K–8.",62,mtms2007-02-294a,,
"As shown in table 1, state standards reveal that prediction can be used in teaching and learning in all content areas and at all grade levels. The content of  prediction  in  state  standards  varies,  which  supports the notion that many topics within a wide variety of content areas can be explored with prediction. Although proofs and arguments seem more appropriate for upper-grade-level students, prediction can be accessible to students in lower grades with both informal and formal explorations.

Fig. 2  A representation of the factored form of x2 + 10x + 21 = 0 x-intercepts  of  the  equation.  The  teacher  provided some help by posing this question:,65,mtms2007-02-294a,,
Could  you  predict  the  x-intercepts  of  the  equation if this representation [shown in fig. 2] was given? ,66,mtms2007-02-294a,,
"Since these students had used this area representation when exploring quadratic functions in expanded and factored forms, they were able to recognize that x2 + 10x + 21 was equivalent to (x + 3)(x + 7). Ashley said  that  3  and  7  would  be  the  x-intercepts  of  the equation. She was asked why 3 and 7 would make sense and responded this way: “If one of the pairs equals 0, the entire equation would equal 0, because any number multiplied by 0 would equal 0.” when she asked the class if this seemed acceptable, Kelsey refuted Ashley’s response. Kelsey stated, “It would have to be –3 and –7, because –3 is the opposite of +3, and –3 and +3 would equal 0.” when the class was asked, “would this make sense?” Torin responded,  “Yes,  because  anything  multiplied  by  0  would equal 0.” Ashley was convinced by these students’ explanations.  Students  were  asked  to  check  this equation  on  their  graphing  calculators:  They  entered y = x2 + 10x + 21, then used the table function to find  the  x-intercepts  based  on  their  knowledge  of finding the y-intercepts of a linear equation on their calculators. Using their calculators, they confirmed that this was true. ",67,mtms2007-02-294a,,
"This approach was also used with another class. Again,  students  were  asked  if  they  could  predict the  x-intercepts  of  y  =  x2  +  10x  +  21.  Nick  quickly predicted the x-intercepts of the equation. He was able to verbalize his reasoning to the class (his written work is shown in fig. 3). He explained that x2 + 10x + 21 = 0 could be changed to x2 + 10x = –21. He stated that he knew the answer would have to be a negative number “because the total needs to be 0.”  At  that  point,  Nick  wrote  the  following  on  the overhead projector: (–3)2 + 10(–3) 9 + –30 = –21 + 21 = 0",68,mtms2007-02-294a,,

"Prediction expectations accompanied by other expectations related to reasoning can promote reasoning at a deeper level. For example, the kindergarten algebra  expectation  from  Utah,  the  second-grade measurement expectation from Ohio, and the seventh-grade data analysis and probability expectation from Oregon in table 1 include “justify,” “test,” or “evaluate” in their expectations. These expectations require students not only to predict but also to further develop reasoning with the use of prediction. ",70,mtms2007-02-294a,,
Students’ Reasoning with Prediction:  An Example from Eighth-Grade Algebra,71,mtms2007-02-294a,,
"IN  THIS  ArTICLE,  wE  wILL  DISCUSS  STUDENTS’ reasoning in two eighth-grade classes when prediction  was  incorporated  in  the  teaching  of  quadratic functions. In these classes, the teacher introduced the concept of x-intercepts of a quadratic function to students  for  the  first  time.  In  the  past,  she  taught this  concept  by  asking  her  students  to  enter  the equation into a graphing calculator and use the table function or trace mode to determine the x-intercepts. Students’ predictions and reasoning in the two classrooms are briefly described below.",72,mtms2007-02-294a,,
"To incorporate prediction into the launch of the  lesson, students were asked this question: ",73,mtms2007-02-294a,,
"If you were given the equation x2 + 10x + 21 = y, could  you  predict  the  x-intercepts  of  this  equation, based on what you know about x-intercepts and equations? ",74,mtms2007-02-294a,,
"To  remind  the  students  of  the  x-intercepts  of  an example  equation,  the  teacher  drew  the  graph shown in figure 1 on the overhead projector. After some initial whole-group discussion, it was evident that  students  were  having  difficulty  predicting  the   is  drawn.  The  prediction  and  the actual  draw  are  recorded,  and  the marble is then returned to the bag. At the  beginning  of  this  activity,  students will make random guesses, but as they see more marbles drawn from the bag, they should be able to  use  the  information  from  previous  draws  to make more reasonable predictions. based on accumulated results of individual cases, students can make a general prediction about what color would be drawn most often. For example, when red, blue, and yellow marbles occurred 6, 4, and 10 times, respectively, a student can predict which color would occur most often using this information. with this marble-drawing activity, students can also predict if there is an advantage to going fi rst or last and if their predictions would change if the marbles were not returned to the bag. In a different variation of this activity, middle-grades students can predict and justify the probability of drawing each color by using only a sample drawn from the bag. They can compare this experimental probability with the previous one, and later with the theoretical probability of drawing each color. They can also be asked to predict the probability of drawing each color when an additional set of each color is added to the bag and justify their prediction. Although the levels of predictions and the sophistication of justifi cation may differ across grades, all these prediction activities can help develop the concept of probability and related reasoning. Such growth in  reasoning  with  probability  also  supports  fi ndings and  suggestions  by  other  researchers  (Garfi eld  and Gal 1999; Jones, Thornton, Langrall, and Tarr 1999). ",75,mtms2007-02-294a,,
"As shown in the algebra classroom example and the  marble  activities,  prediction  in  data  analysis and probability is similar to that in algebra in that students  develop  initial  reasoning  based  on  prior knowledge  and  experience  in  both  content  areas even though each topic has its own characteristics. These are just two content examples using prediction that enhance reasoning. Topics in other content strands can also be explored with prediction. ",76,mtms2007-02-294a,,
Suggestions ,77,mtms2007-02-294a,,
"THE CLASSrOOM VIGNETTE INTrODUCED EArLIEr illustrates  how  prediction  can  promote  reasoning when the teacher purposely used students’ predictions to orchestrate the discussion around important mathematical concepts (i.e., x-intercepts). A careful plan to deliberately encourage prediction throughout the lesson will enhance the depth of reasoning, the level of understanding, and students’ sustained interest in the lesson. In planning a lesson, teachers should be keenly aware of the possibilities that the lesson provides to  incorporate  prediction-type  questions.

"He said, “If one of the x-intercepts is –3, the other x-intercept  must  be  –7,  because  –3  ×  –7  equals  21 from  the  original  equation.”  when  asked  why  –3 was selected, he said, “I knew one of the x-intercepts needed to be a factor of 21 and that number also had to  be  a  number  added  to  something  else  to  equal 10.”  After  further  discussion,  the  students  in  this class accepted Nick’s argument.",81,mtms2007-02-294a,,
"In  this  eighth-grade  algebra  example,  students predicted x-intercepts of a quadratic function using their  prior  knowledge  (i.e.,  the  meaning  of  intercepts and characteristics of and forms of quadratic functions) and justifi ed their predictions. Notice that students who had different predictions in the fi rst class gave the same justifi cation: “because anything multiplied by 0 would equal 0.” This could have been further discussed to help elaborate these students’ thinking and develop reasoning skills. To promote students’  reasoning  in  such  ways,  an  appropriate teacher role is needed. As such, a few suggestions are provided later in this article. ",82,mtms2007-02-294a,,
Prediction in Probability,83,mtms2007-02-294a,,
"IN THE PrEVIOUS SECTION, wE ILLUSTrATED STUdents’ prediction and reasoning with an algebra topic in eighth-grade classes. To demonstrate reasoning with prediction across content strands, we briefl y describe activities in another content area that are adaptable to a range of grade levels. The reasoning and prediction requirements related to student thinking are expected to progressively increase as the grade level increases. Marble activities are described hereafter to help develop reasoning in the area of probability. ",84,mtms2007-02-294a,,
"One  activity  involves  drawing  one  marble  from  a bag containing an unknown number of red, blue, and yellow  marbles.  A  student  will  predict  the  color  that he or she anticipates will be chosen, then the marble  revisited as exploration proceeds. In this way, prediction  can  contribute  in  the  course  of learning, not simply used as a premature guess  that is never addressed at some later time. we suggest ideas below that teachers can try to promote student reasoning, with “prediction” as a catalyst. ",85,mtms2007-02-294a,,
"Build an appropriate classroom environment to promote reasoning. At the onset of the school year, teachers  can  create  a  classroom  environment  in  which students  feel  comfortable  taking  risks  and  making conjectures.  Students  need  to  know  that  all  ideas will be entertained and valued. In addition, students need to feel that both the teacher and classmates will respect all their ideas. To promote thinking and discourse by encouraging students to share ideas with one another and to evaluate classmates’ ideas should be the culture of the classroom. In such an environment, the teacher does not dominate classroom discourse; the teacher and students share and examine ideas (see brendefur and Frykholm 2000). ",86,mtms2007-02-294a,,
Ask questions to invite students’ ideas. Helpful and appropriate  teacher  questioning  enhances  student engagement  in  reasoning  and  participation  in  discussion. Teachers can think about the types of prediction questions they will ask students before the lesson begins. These questions will invite students’ deep ideas and thinking processes. Some questions that are useful to ask in general are these: •  “what information did you use to predict?” •  “what makes you think your prediction is true?” •  “Is there another way to predict your result?” •  “Is there another prediction you could make?” •  “How  could  you  convince  another  student  that  your prediction fi ts the situation?” •  “How is your prediction the same as or different  from the prediction of other students?” •  “Can you draw any general conclusions based on  your prediction being true?” •  “why do you think the actual results do not agree  with your prediction?” ,87,mtms2007-02-294a,,
"Provide  sufﬁ cient  wait  time  so  that  students  can think and then express their ideas. without adequate wait time, there will be fewer opportunities for students  to  reason  and  verbalize  their  mathematical ideas. Even good questions may not encourage reasoning if there is insuffi cient time to think. ",88,mtms2007-02-294a,,
"Set  an  expectation  that  a  prediction  should  be based  on  reasoning.  This  philosophy  goes  hand  in hand  with  justifying,  testing,  examining,  comparing, and revising. Prediction alone is not suffi cient to promote reasoning at a deeper level; prediction should be pursued as one of several aspects of reasoning. Examples from the state standards in table 1 also show that some prediction expectations are required in conjunction with other forms of reasoning, such as justifi cation, testing, and evaluation.  we consider the following list of questions useful for keeping track of classroom practices that promote students’ thinking and reasoning with prediction:  •  Do  planned  lessons  provide  opportunities  to predict  outcomes  or  results  before  engaging  in exploration?  •  what  prior  knowledge  forms  the  basis  for  stu- dents’ predictions?  •  Are students given opportunities to examine other students’ statements? •  Are students given opportunities to compare results with their predictions? •  Does the lesson require students to justify, test,  or evaluate their predictions? •  Does the lesson require students to modify or extend their predictions?",89,mtms2007-02-294a,,
Conclusion,90,mtms2007-02-294a,,
"USING  wELL  THOUGHT  OUT  PrEDICTION  QUES tions can make a difference in encouraging students’ reasoning  in  the  mathematics  classroom.  Initially, students  may  make  random  guesses  when  asked  to respond to prediction questions. As the expectation to support  prediction  becomes  common  practice  in  the classroom, students will become accustomed to providing a rationale for their thinking. Such a rationale can be  promoted  and  refi ned  by  requiring  that  students supply convincing arguments. when this occurs, students and the teacher will begin to feel more comfortable and confi dent in the process. Although prediction is  often  based  solely  on  initial  thoughts  using  prior knowledge, prediction sets a foundation for later discourse that gives students opportunities to defend or refute ideas that they brought forth at the beginning of an exploration.
