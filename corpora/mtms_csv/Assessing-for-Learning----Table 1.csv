0,Assessing for Learning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Continual assessment of student understanding is a crucial aspect of teaching. The adoption of the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSM) represents raised expectations for the level and depth of mathematical understanding that is expected of our students. But new standards also mean new tests. What those tests will be like is of concern for many: students, teachers, parents, and school administrators. Although various consortia and groups work on designing better assessments for accountability and reporting at the state and national levels, this article is concerned with improving assessment design and practice in the classroom. How can teachers design test items to meet the goals of CCSSM and assess deep mathematical understanding while also offering opportunities to learn?",,
1,Assessing for Learning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We present research-based strategies that use levels of mathematical cognition to design assessment items. These design strategies apply to such formative assessments as warm-ups; informal questioning; class discussions; problem sets incorporating practice, evaluation, and feedback; and summative assessment including unit tests, projects, and quizzes that are used to determine grades. CCSSM provides a common framework of learning goals; in this article, we focus on one standard from seventh grade to illustrate the strategies.",,
2,Assessing for Learning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,LEARNING LEVELS,,
3,Assessing for Learning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"To develop meaningful assessment items, it is helpful to organize expectations of student learning into cognitive types or learning levels. Table 1 lists seven cognitive learning levels, defined by Cangelosi (2002), which will be explored in length: construct a concept, discover a relationship, simple knowledge, comprehension and communication, algorithmic skill, application, and creative thinking.",,
4,Assessing for Learning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"These learning levels describe the kinds of thinking that are typically required in learning mathematics and are ordered according to a learning progression that is meant to help teachers plan instruction. The ordering in the table reflects the fact that students construct concepts and discover relationships before they are prepared to attach conventional mathematical names and procedures to new ideas and commit those ideas to memory. Hence, lessons focused on constructing a concept and discovering a relationship should precede lessons addressing simple knowledge and algorithmic skills. Throughout the learning process, students must explain their mathematical understanding using more formal notation and vocabulary as they deepen their comprehension. For this reason, it is good practice to integrate comprehension and communication learning into many lessons. Finally, students are prepared for deductive thinking required in applications and have knowledge to do truly creative work with mathematics. In this stage, students bring mathematical understanding into their own practice of creative problem solving. (Note: This ordering is not meant to be rigid. For example, applications can also be effectively used at the beginning of an instructional unit to motivate and stimulate student thinking on the mathematical content that follows in a problem-based learning approach.)",,
5,Assessing for Learning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Consider the following standard from CCSSM:,,
6,Assessing for Learning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Know the formulas for the area and circumference of a circle and use them to solve problems; give an informal derivation of the relationship between the circumference and area of a circle. (CCSSI 2010, p. 50, 7.G.4, )",,
7,Assessing for Learning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Clearly, asking students to state the formulas (simple knowledge) and compute the area and/or the circumference of a given circle (algorithmic skill) are relevant to this standard. However, this standard calls for more. Students also need a deep enough understanding of these formulas to solve problems (application) and explain derivations (comprehension and communication). The wording in CCSSM calls for high levels of cognition, mathematical reasoning, thinking, and engagement not only in the practice standards but also in the content standards themselves.",,
8,Assessing for Learning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"What follows is a summary of assessment item design strategies based on the learning levels in table 1, illustrated with sample items from a seventh-grade unit of instruction about circles. Each assessment item has an objective related to the chosen standard (7.G.4, CCSSM 2010) and includes either a scoring guide or a detailed rubric. A scoring guide makes the item quick to grade, but it fails to provide much feedback to students. A rubric takes longer for the teacher to design, but it provides an efficient way to communicate detailed feedback about written responses. In our experience, a rubric makes grading easier for the teacher and provides an opportunity for students to learn from the evaluation. Often a version of the scoring guide or rubric can be included in the prompt so students know what is important.",,
9,Assessing for Learning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,ASSESSMENT DESIGN STRATEGIES AND EXAMPLES,,
10,Assessing for Learning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Construct a Concept,,
11,Assessing for Learning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"To achieve this standard, students must know about circles (a concept they have begun constructing since before kindergarten), and conceptually understand the difference between area and circumference.",,
12,Assessing for Learning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"To design an assessment item at the construct a concept learning level, give students prompts that require sorting or categorizing. By sorting examples into categories, students display how they have built a concept in their minds. See the example in figure 1.",,
13,Assessing for Learning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Prompts like this offer students an opportunity to make connections. For example, with item e, students gain exposure to a connection between probability computations and area models. They also associate attributes of circles with their everyday real-world experience. One critique of this item is that it relies on cultural knowledge about hat sizes and basketball. If the students are unfamiliar with those topics, replace the examples with more personally relevant ideas: Perhaps students know more about trampolines, clock faces, the rings of Saturn, or hula hoops. Teachers customize tests for their own students individual backgrounds because considering cultural experience is relevant.",,
14,Assessing for Learning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Here we have merely provided a quick scoring guide. We recommend that the teacher follow up by conducting a discussion that addresses how or why area or circumference applies in each situation.,,
15,Assessing for Learning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Other approaches for testing the construct a concept learning level include asking students to describe concept attributes and create examples or nonexamples of their own. Such activities point out students understanding of a mathematical concept, which is an object in mathematics worthy of careful consideration and definition, without asking them to state the definition from memory (simple knowledge).",,
16,Assessing for Learning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Discover a Relationship,,
17,Assessing for Learning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"When students have used inductive reasoning to make mathematical discoveries, they may have had a personal and unique experience. Such a scenario can be difficult to test. However, we can look for evidence that students made those discoveries by requiring them to report narratives of the experience of discovery. See figure 2, in which students report on what they learned by engaging in a class activity. To avoid an emphasis on simply recalling facts, remind students of the relationship that was found. Such a prompt sends the message to students that thoughtfully doing the discovery activity is valued, not just knowing the resulting relationship.",,
18,Assessing for Learning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Simple Knowledge,,
19,Assessing for Learning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"For this levels assessment, think stimulus and response and ask students to respond based on what they remember. Figure 3a and 3b explore the simple knowledge level. Although figure 3a is explicitly solicited in the standard of focus, figure 3b implies that this unit also includes some history of mathematics that is valued by the teacher. This history may be a motivator for students as they encounter more geometry of circles in future grades or as part of the derivation sought in the second part of the standard.  Figure 3b can easily be modified to become a comprehension and communication level item, by prompting students to explain the method instead of merely recalling or naming it.",,
20,Assessing for Learning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Comprehension and Communication,,
21,Assessing for Learning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Assessment at this level requires a prompt that induces students to formulate explanations involving literal and/or interpretive understanding of a technical mathematical expression or a mathematical message. Such items are relevant for assessing students understanding of mathematics and fluency with their use of the relevant mathematical language. It is important that students should not be asked to merely repeat memorized information (derivations, relationships, or definitions). The prompt instead needs to be novel to the students. Otherwise, they may just try to recall an answer (simple knowledge) instead of focusing their attention on explaining their understanding. Figure 4 shows an assessment item at the comprehension and communication learning level. Note that the second half of standard 7.G.4 directly calls for students to achieve this kind of learning and explain mathematical arguments.",,
22,Assessing for Learning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Algorithmic Skill,,
23,Assessing for Learning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"To demonstrate algorithmic skill learning, students will be required to recall a sequence of steps and execute the specified mathematical procedure. When designing the prompt, emphasize the process, not the outcome. One might even state the answer up front and ask students to show the computational steps that led to that result, thereby providing an opportunity for students to check their work as they practice the procedure (as they frequently do with answers in the back of the book). Stating an answer up front is not required.",,
24,Assessing for Learning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Figure 5a, an algorithmic skill level prompt, may appear in a textbook as an application because there is a context and it is phrased as a word problem. A more typical algorithmic skill level item might consist of a drawing of a circle with the radius or diameter length labelled. However, in figure 5a, students are explicitly told what to compute and to work with given information only. Hence, they exercise no further cognitive work than algorithmic skill to plug the numbers into the appropriate procedure to respond to this prompt.",,
25,Assessing for Learning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Another algorithmic skill relevant for this standard is the practice of drawing circles of specified dimensions using a compass and a ruler. Developing these skills provides a good way for students to practice making computations of radius, diameter, area, and circumference, and to gain comfort using tools important for further geometric exploration in subsequent grades. Note that this prompt also reverses the typical given (radius) and find (area), requiring students to more thoughtfully apply equation-solving techniques they learned previously. (See fig. 5b.)",,
26,Assessing for Learning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Application,,
27,Assessing for Learning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Students show achievement of application level learning if they demonstrate proficiency deciding how to solve problems. They show that they can decide if a particular situation is an example of a broader mathematical principle or not, exhibiting deductive reasoning. Hence, unlike the algorithmic skill prompts, assessment items at this level should be crafted to avoid clue words that tell students what they need to do. In these problems, students may encounter extraneous data or they may need to find missing data to complete the problem. Some applications incorporate knowledge about nonmathematical topics.",,
28,Assessing for Learning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Figure 6 is an extended performance task rather than an item that can be used easily on a test because of the time and tools required to answer it. We would use it as a project type of assessment due on the unit test day. The item induces students to demonstrate their achievement of the first part of the standard, Know the formulas for the area and circumference of a circle and use them to solve problems, at a high level of cognitive activity, rather than simple recall. The results of this assessment would be nice to display in the classroom.",,
29,Assessing for Learning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Assessment design at the application level can also be done using shorter-format problems. One might mix examples and nonexamples using a prompt similar to figure 1, asking students to recognize and perhaps set up equations for situations requiring area or circumference calculations. Including circle-related prompts that do not require the area or circumference formulas make the conclusions less obvious and should be used to ensure that deductive reasoning is employed.",,
30,Assessing for Learning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Creative Thinking,,
31,Assessing for Learning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Some teachers integrate art into their teaching of mathematics, which is commendable. However, requiring students to employ technical artistic skills should not be confused with creativity in mathematics. For example, at some point in this unit, it would be great to lead students through a procedure for creating a six-petal flower with a compass (an algorithmic skill). Even if the teacher encourages artistic originality by asking students to make an elaborate picture or design including the flower, assessing their skill of replicating the design should not be considered mathematical creativity.",,
32,Assessing for Learning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"To design items that test your students at the creative thinking level, we recommend using synectics, the juxtaposition of seemingly unrelated ideas. It helps to be a little spontaneous and playful in your interactions with students to spark curiosity and creativity. Open-ended application prompts also may be used to assess creativity. The marking should ensure that different and unusual mathematical thinking receives higher scores. Note that the scoring guide in figure 7 gives higher scores for originality.",,
33,Assessing for Learning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Typically in schools, students learn to increasingly exhibit conventional and convergent thinking and are not rewarded for divergent thinking. An item like figure 7 is rarely found on tests, and students may even feel intimidated by such prompts. The older the students, the more intimidation they might feel, as they have grown accustomed to certain types of thinking in schools. It might be more natural to use this example as a warm-up exercise and follow up with a class discussion about some of the mathematical ideas expressed in the responses. Perhaps some students have thought about the uniqueness of individual snowflakes and the unique patterns that can be found at random places in the never-ending decimal representation of pi. Others may have focused on the roundness of a flake of snow and noted that pi emerges in the geometry of round things. Maybe only one student describes the geometric similarity of all circles and compares that with the self-similarity exhibited in snowflakes, also noting that circles have infinitely many lines of symmetry and the decimal representation of pi continues indefinitely. Resist the temptation to overexplain students most novel ideas and take over their thinking. After students get more accustomed to creativity in mathematics, you can start including creative thinking prompts on summative tests.",,
34,Assessing for Learning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,CANGELOSIS LEARNING LEVELS,,
35,Assessing for Learning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We have shared a structure of categorizing mathematical cognition that we find very useful for assessment item design, Cangelosis learning levels, and we have demonstrated various design principles in the examples for the chosen standard. We believe that by employing these strategies in test design, students will actually learn from taking the test. We have shared assessment items for each level of cognition in this structure merely to illustrate them and also to share some strategies we use to instruct and assess seventh-grade level content particular to circles. However, these methods of designing assessments around the levels of cognition expected of students can be applied to any topic in our mathematics courses.",,
36,Assessing for Learning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We further suggest using this cognitive structure to evaluate test items or exercises in textbooks. Once you decide, for example, that comprehension and communication level cognition is of particular importance for a given standard, design or select items that address that learning level. Imagine that the district pops a common formative assessment on your doorstep and asks you to use it in place of your regular teaching activities. Look over the items. Are they primarily at the simple knowledge level or algorithmic skill level, perpetuating the notion that mathematics is all about memorizing a slew of facts and procedures? Or do the district- provided assessments help assess students progress on the high levels of cognition that CCSSM demands?",,
37,Assessing for Learning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The reason for concern about tests is also clear: High-stakes standardized tests have been misused to evaluate teachers and schools, encouraging poor instruction focused on test preparation and superficially covering topics, thus consuming large amounts of time in the school year. Associations with rampant cheating have also occurred (Gojak 2013; Picciotto 2014). Teachers need to be outspoken about poor assessment practice that is drowning out high-quality instruction. The strategies in this article can be helpful for improving assessment design and for evaluating assessments that other test writers provide.",,
38,Assessing for Learning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We feel encouraged by the fact that a wider range of assessment types are called for by CCSSM and are pleased that teachers are becoming more engaged in test writing within schools and districts (Gojak 2013). Teacher-designed assessments are valuable and relevant because they cater to the students as individuals and are part of a central and meaningful human relationship in education: that between the student and her teacher. This view of assessment is in line with the results of a recent survey in which students, teachers, and administrators declare the classroom tests to be far more valuable than end-of-year testing (NEA 2014).",,
