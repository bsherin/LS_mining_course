"As part of a regional professional  development grant, a group of fourteen in-service K-12 teachers gathered to discuss ways to use posters and images in the classroom to help students better visualize mathematics. The group explored passive posters, those used for decoration and inspiration; participated in a problem-solving contest using NCTM’s 100 Favorite Calendar Problems poster; and discussed the images from the Mathematics Teacher’s “Mathematical Lens” column. By far, however, the most exciting discussion stemmed from a grid-style poster designed by one of the facilitators.  grid Posters",3,mtms2012-08-10a,,
"Using multiple representations is a key component in building student understanding. The grid posters described here are especially relevant to mathematical concepts involving representation.

"Posters addressing mathematics can come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and colors. They can have various uses and can be designed commercially or produced by teachers or students. Regardless of who makes them, their purposes can range from passive wall adornment to active classroom resource.",6,mtms2012-08-10a,,
"One category of poster, decorative  or motivational, may or may not address mathematics. Another category of poster can provide challenges, contain inspirational thoughts, illustrate thought-provoking puzzles, explore a biography, or celebrate the mathematician of the day. This category might also introduce or reinforce a mathematical concept or definition or illustrate a mathematical idea in a real-world context or puzzle.",7,mtms2012-08-10a,,
"We present a third category that  can actively engage students and teachers with mathematics in a novel way. Novelty is an important aspect of maintaining middle school students’ interest and motivation when learning mathematics (Sousa 2008). With these categories in mind, the active-engagement posters that we describe here can be used to introduce and practice new concepts and assess student learning.",8,mtms2012-08-10a,,

Sixteen sticky notes were labeled with terms, special properties, images, and defining features of these special points. Using their combined knowledge of triangles, the teachers placed the sticky notes on their charts so that each row was specific to a particular point. For example, sticky notes with the word “orthocenter” and its special properties, image, and defining features had to be arranged in the same row on the grid. ",9,mtms2012-08-10a,,
"After groups considered the grid  posters and reviewed what they knew about special points of a triangle, they were given a new mathematical topic and asked to design their own sticky notes. One group worked with fractions, decimals, and percentages; another group worked with linear functions; a third group worked with quadratic functions. Recognizing that “representation is central to the study of mathematics” (NCTM 2000,  p. 280), we chose to emphasize multiple representations within each of these topics and gave teachers specific categories to consider when designing their posters. For example, the quadratic functions group received a chart with the headings “standard form,” “vertex form,” “factored form,” and “graphical representation” (see fig. 1).",10,mtms2012-08-10a,,
lessons learned,11,mtms2012-08-10a,,
"After completing the posters, teachers shared and discussed strategies used to design their examples. The linear functions group considered it important to use the same numbers in different ways so that students could not simply guess using a process of elimination. Notice that 2s and 3s appear in all four of their examples (see fig. 2). This group wanted to show slopes that were positive, negative, 0, and undefined. The original grid included four rows, but participants discussed designing a version with ",12,mtms2012-08-10a,,

"When the fraction-decimal-  percent group shared its poster, an interesting conversation emerged about color-coding rows versus  columns. In the majority of posters,  a particular column was the same color. For example, every graphical representation of a parabola appeared on a blue sticky note. The fraction- decimal-percent group made each  teacher-developed grids mirrored potential classroom posters.  row the same color (see fig. 3). Teachers recognized the possible drawback of this approach in that students will quickly recognize that they need only find all the yellow sticky notes to complete the row representing 2.5, for example, without using any knowledge of mathematics.",16,mtms2012-08-10a,,

"Teachers brainstormed various poster topics, such as triangle congruences (type of congruence, example picture, abbreviation, symbolic notation), symmetry (type of symmetry, example picture, algebraic and coordinate example, definition or special property), and systems of equations (system, graphical representation, solution, as well as independent, dependent, inconsistent). All examples contained four columns and four rows, but this design could easily be altered depending on the mathematical topic. The linear-equations group, for example, suggested including “standard form of the equation” as a fifth column and refining the original equation column to read “slope-intercept form of the equation.” ",18,mtms2012-08-10a,,
"When determining the headings  for the various columns, it is important to consider topics that have  multiple entry points. According to Goldin and Shteingold,  effective mathematical thinking involves understanding the relationships among different representations of “the same” concept as well as the structural similarities (and differences) among representational systems . . . the student must develop adequate internal representations for interacting with various systems  (p. 9, 2001). ",19,mtms2012-08-10a,,
"A carefully designed grid poster will have headings and examples that allow students to begin matching any two components that they feel most confident with in that there is no required starting point. Depending on their comfort level, students may begin matching cards starting with the relationships found among the representations. With repetition of the activity, they will strengthen their  fluency with the other representations as well. ",20,mtms2012-08-10a,,
"Teachers produced workshop  posters using chart paper and sticky notes because these supplies were inexpensive. As the teachers became excited about the prospect of using these posters for a variety of topics with students, they wanted to make them more durable and versatile. For a more permanent poster, laminated cards placed in plastic pockets or cards containing Velcro® or a magnet could be used instead of sticky notes. Sturdier material, such as foam board or laminated poster board, will allow the poster to hold up better than chart paper. Headings for these sturdy posters can be left blank so that one grid poster with pockets or cells can be changed with each unit of study. A poster can promote linear equations one week and quadratic equations later in the year. ",21,mtms2012-08-10a,,

If a grid poster is given a permanent place in the room, the teacher can remove or rearrange cards and ask students to correct or complete it. Changing the poster encourages students to truly recognize the connections between ideas or representations and not simply placement. These classroom tools can also be used to review a topic before an exam. Individual students can be asked to complete the grids, perhaps smaller grids in an activity sheet format, as one form of assessing content knowledge.  grid Posters in action  in the classrooM",23,mtms2012-08-10a,,
"One middle school teacher who participated in our workshop shared an advantage of a nonpermanent grid poster that she used in her classroom. This teacher had divided her class into seven groups to review linear functions. Each group received a grid poster with the same headings that were used at the workshop (“equation of the line,” “graphical representation,” “verbal description,” and “xy-table”). For each of the seven groups, the teacher created four sticky notes, each stating a unique linear function. Students were then asked to use sticky notes with graphical representations, verbal descriptions, and xy-tables for each of their equations to complete the grid.",24,mtms2012-08-10a,,
"As each group completed its  poster, the teacher verified that the work was correct. Then the groups removed and rearranged the sticky notes to create a puzzle for the next set of students. Groups rotated and completed the grid at their new seats. This novel activity allowed students to practice moving from one type of representation of linear functions to another, which will strengthen their algebraic problem-solving skills.",25,mtms2012-08-10a,,

"Educators often think of posters and photographs as simply decoration or background, but a mathematics poster with a grid of mathematics can act as a tool in the classroom. Posters can be viewed in a new way in that they can be sources for a mathematical activity, much like a set of problems of the week. Students can create posters to highlight mathematical topics from the curriculum or quotes from famous mathematicians. Images and advertisements can launch a discussion of real-world mathematics. As you begin to see posters in a new light, you will learn to create activities that engage students in learning. Using grid posters is one way to get students involved with school mathematics in a serious yet novel way. With careful design and thought, an item that most teachers may have hanging in their classroom can become a source of fruitful mathematical discussion.",27,mtms2012-08-10a,,
