"Veterinarians often have to determine the age of a dog when recommending appropriate care. One rough calculation of a dog’s age in relation to a human’s age is to estimate that for every 1 human year, a dog ages 7 years. This calculation is not precise because the rate at which dogs age depends on their size and current age. The table at right lists information that will help a vet determine a dog’s age.

Determine the average rate of aging for years 3–10 for dogs in each weight class. Which dogs age the fastest?  4. Use the table and patterns from problem 2 or the information from problem 3 to predict the ages of the following:  a. A 15-year-old dog that is between 50–90 lbs.,10,mtms2012-10-192a,,

Graph the data in the table as points in the coordinate plane (Human years, Dog years). Make a separate graph for each weight class of dogs. Do any of the graphs appear to be linear? Why, or why not?  2. Determine the increase per year  for each weight class of dog. In  general, what can you say about  the first 2 years?",14,mtms2012-10-192a,,
