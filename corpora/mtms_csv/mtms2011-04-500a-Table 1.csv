"Gauss’s Idea: Take a Notion  A grandfather clock in Jodie’s home chimes once at one o’clock, twice at two o’clock, and so on. If there are no chimes except at the top of the hour, how many times does the clock chime between one o’clock and ten o’clock? ",2,mtms2011-04-500a,,
You might recognize this problem as a basic application of the Gauss formula. Many mathematics teachers enjoy telling the story of the precocious young math wizard who was given this assignment: ,3,mtms2011-04-500a,,

"Young Carl Frederick Gauss confounded his teacher’s attempt to give him busy work and realized that, instead of performing a tedious string of sums, he could pair numbers and multiply. The sum of the fi rst and last terms is 101, and the same is true for the second smallest and second largest, and so on (see fi g. 1). Gauss saw that the fi fty pairs of numbers each summed to 101, so he quickly multiplied and gave the answer of 5050.",6,mtms2011-04-500a,,

"For the clock example above, assuming that we count the chimes at 1 and 10, we have fi ve pairs of numbers that sum to 11. Jodie would hear 55 total chimes. To help students visualize the pairing of terms, we suggest using a strip of 2 cm grid paper, writing each term of the sequence in a separate box, and cutting the sequence strip to the correct length (see fi g. 2a). To fi nd the middle of the sequence, fold the ends together and cut along the fold. The two pieces of grid paper can then be placed as shown in fi gure 2b. When arranged correctly, with one set of numbers upside down, the pattern will be clear.",8,mtms2011-04-500a,,
"Gauss once said, “What we need are notions, not notations.” He produced an idea of exquisite quality and extreme fl exibility. The formula, however, is narrow and unyielding. Using Gauss’s idea, a series of mathematical discoveries await us. The formula, just to remind you, is often presented as the sum of the fi rst n positive integers: ∑n + =∑n 1 2 3+⋅⋅⋅+ = + =n + + 1 2 3 1 2 3 k∑ n +( +n( +n +( +n )1 )1",9,mtms2011-04-500a,,
"Fig. 1 To find the sum of the first 100 numbers, Gauss paired numbers in the series to establish a formula for the sum.",10,mtms2011-04-500a,,
"We heartily recommend pursuing the notion, rather than trying to help students decipher this difficult notation.",11,mtms2011-04-500a,,
"Consider these problems:  1.  How many times does Jodie’s clock  chime between 3:30 and 11:30? 2.  Jeremy’s mother puts 7 candles on  his birthday cake for his seventh birthday, uses 8 candles for his eighth birthday, and so on. How many candles does Jeremy blow out, starting on his seventh birthday and finishing with his thirteenth?",12,mtms2011-04-500a,,
We ask students for the following sums:,13,mtms2011-04-500a,,

"Using Gauss’s approach, we find pairs of numbers with equal sums, leveraging the speed of multiplication to avoid repeated addition. ",17,mtms2011-04-500a,,
"For problem 1, 4 + 11 = 15, as does 5 + 10, and so on. We have four pairs of numbers whose sums are 15; there- fore, the answer is 60. The process works on a wide range of patterns, so we need not start at one or count by ones. For example, we could also ask: 2 + 4 + 6 + · · · + 98 + 100 = ?",18,mtms2011-04-500a,,
"We have 25 pairs of numbers whose sums are 102, so the answer is 2550. ",19,mtms2011-04-500a,,
"In problem 2, the sum of the listed numbers 7 + 8 + · · · + 13 has an odd number of terms, so an extra half pair remains. Paper folding can be used here as well to help spark a discussion about whether Gauss’s idea still works. With this problem, we must cut one of the squares in half (see  fig. 3). We have three pairs of numbers whose sum is 20, plus the left- over 10. In other words, we have three pairs of 20 plus a half pair of 20, or 3.5 × 20, which gives the correct answer of 70.",20,mtms2011-04-500a,,

Sixth-grade students can use Gauss’s idea with the following:  1.  21 + 24 + 27 + · · · + 87 + 90 2.  25 + 30 + 35 + · · · + 70 + 75 3.  9 + 13 + 17 + · · · + 33 + 37 4.  28 + 26 + 24 + · · · + (−6) + (−8),23,mtms2011-04-500a,,
"Although the formula works in some settings, Gauss’s idea is more robust, and we explore it in activity sheets 1, 2, and 3. Activity sheet 1 uses paper-folding activities to help students investigate this approach. Activity sheet 2 has similar problems  that involve story contexts. Activity sheet 3 demonstrates several short discovery problems that extend the idea to noninteger settings. Other interesting examples can be written using Gauss’s idea to develop number sense and computational fluency. We suggest using short discovery problems based on this approach throughout the curriculum to introduce new topics and to review and practice other topics. All investigations described can be solved by sixth-grade students who use Gauss’s idea creatively.",24,mtms2011-04-500a,,

"What is Gauss’s idea? A sequence of numbers with a fixed, or common, difference between terms is called an arithmetic sequence. The first term can be any real number including a negative integer or a rational number. The only requirement is that the difference between any two adjacent terms is constant.  ",26,mtms2011-04-500a,,
"Gauss’s approach provides an easy  way to calculate the sum of a finite number of consecutive terms in any arithmetic series, with one caveat: Discovering the exact number of pairs can sometimes be tricky. However, that trickiness has led two of our classes of in-service teachers (and their classes of fourth-grade and fifthgrade students) into some exciting mathematical explorations. By using this idea, we can structure quality investigations for students at almost any level.",27,mtms2011-04-500a,,
"See, for instance, the following  series:",28,mtms2011-04-500a,,
Example 1 21 + 24 + 27 + · · · + 87 + 90 = ?,29,mtms2011-04-500a,,
We can see that the sum of each pair is 111. Most students can routinely find that part of the solution. The more interesting issue involves determining how many pairs of numbers are in the sequence. Most students ,30,mtms2011-04-500a,,
Fig. 4 Students may easily determine the sum of each pair but not how many pairs are found. This arrangement can easily be explored using arrays.,31,mtms2011-04-500a,,

If you have a hundred chart in your classroom, your students may think of an array. The approach shown in figure 4a is typical.",32,mtms2011-04-500a,,
"Of the seven rows of numbers, four rows have three numbers (12 total), and three rows have four numbers (12 total). Since 24 numbers are in the sequence, 12 pairs are found. The sum of the sequence is 1332. Short discovery investigations like this promote the use of ordered lists and arrays, which are good problemsolving tools for all levels of mathematics to ensure that each item in a group is counted.",33,mtms2011-04-500a,,
What happens with an odd number of terms?,34,mtms2011-04-500a,,
Example 2 25 + 30 + 35 + · · · + 70 + 75 = ?,35,mtms2011-04-500a,,
"We have sums of 100, but eleven terms are in the series. How many pairs do we have? Initially, our inservice teachers worried that having  5.5 pairs might lead to a noninteger answer when the sum must clearly be a whole number. In this case, the sum is 550. But will the sum of an odd number of integers always be an integer? The answer is yes, but asking students to verify the result will spark a good mathematical discussion. We asked a class of in-service  teachers if Gauss’s approach would work if the series included negative terms:",36,mtms2011-04-500a,,
Example 3 28 + 26 + 24 + · · · + (−6) + (−8) = ?,37,mtms2011-04-500a,,
These teachers were concerned because the first and last sum seemed very different. We asked how we could investigate whether it would work for a series such as this. They decided to use another problemsolving tool by testing several simpler but related problems. They used the sums of several short sequences to easily perform the additions and verify the result using Gauss’s approach. See these examples: •	 (−1) + 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 •	 (−1) + 1 + 3 + 5,38,mtms2011-04-500a,,
"Returning to the original sum, we attempted the same type of arrangement as found in example 3 (see  fig. 4b).",39,mtms2011-04-500a,,
"Counting the pairs posed no problem when using this 4 × 5 array. With 20 cells in the array and one “hole,” our students quickly counted the 19 numbers. That means that there are 9.5 pairs, and the sum of each pair is 20. Therefore, the sum of the sequence is given by 9.5 × 20 = 190.",40,mtms2011-04-500a,,
discussion,41,mtms2011-04-500a,,
"Choosing the right arithmetic sequence can reinforce arithmetic operations with fractions, mixed numbers, and integers. The approach that was discovered by young Gauss also  works on sums such as these:  • 2 +2+ +2 3 3+ 3 3 3 3 ⋅⋅⋅+ +++7 •	 3.20	+	3.32	+	3.44	+	·	·	·	+	4.28	+	4.40",42,mtms2011-04-500a,,
"Short discovery problems using this idea can introduce many topics in the middle-grades curriculum. Many different problem-solving techniques arise as we attempt to fi nd the patterns and count pairs. In so doing, operational fl uency with different types of rational numbers can be improved. In place of repetitive practice activity sheets, we suggest strategically placing problems involving Gauss’s idea throughout the course to help students review operations with integers and rational numbers.",43,mtms2011-04-500a,,
"For younger students, we make  the sequences shorter and use simpler fractions, mixed numbers, or decimals. For older or more advanced students, we can make the sequences longer, use more diffi cult quantities, or both.",44,mtms2011-04-500a,,
"Allowing students to tackle problems without being confi ned to a formula may present them with an opportunity to develop habits of mind that are implicit in good problem solving. For instance, many students may actually try to develop a formula. They will notice patterns in their work and want to summarize and simplify. This desire contributes to an appreciation for algebraic notation and a clearer understanding of symbols. These types of short discovery activities presented on a regular basis allow students to progress naturally  into successful problem solving and to move along the problem-solving continuum from novice to expert.",45,mtms2011-04-500a,,
