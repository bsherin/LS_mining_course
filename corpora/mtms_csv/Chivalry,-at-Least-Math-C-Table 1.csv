A variety of mnemonic devices were used by my sixth-grade prealgebra students to remind them to employ order of operations. The rules were often recalled by rote, yet applied inconsistently.",,
67,"Chivalry, at Least Math Chivalry, Is Not Dead! - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","The students had little trouble locating Aunt Sally’s errors. They were able to identify that 12 × 2 should be completed before subtracting the product from 30. They also recognized that the 3 was squared, and that the product of 4 and 3 should not be squared.",,
68,"Chivalry, at Least Math Chivalry, Is Not Dead! - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Discovering their own errors was much more difficult. The first few problems were warm-ups, and the class began generating multiple answers with problem 3d. Answers included 6, 12, 10, 2, 9, 5, and 27. I listed all answers on the board without discussing the correct one. We completed one step at a time, and with each step another student groaned because he or she had located a calculation error.",,
69,"Chivalry, at Least Math Chivalry, Is Not Dead! - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","For this problem, the most common error involved distributing the –1. The class broke into our chanting reminder, “The sign goes with the term.” We followed the same procedure for problems 3e and 3f, discovering miscalculations involving signs and computational accuracy. Error analysis is a critical part of our class, and these problems provided another opportunity to fine-tune skills!",,

I had the students work in teams throughout the activity. When students were working on problem 3, they were doing a great job of justifying their reasoning. This activity served as a good review of order of operations, which is extremely necessary in prealgebra. Several students felt like they were able to persevere in problem solving throughout this activity.",,

77,"Chivalry, at Least Math Chivalry, Is Not Dead! - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","I tried this cartoon activity in my algebra class. I think it was a great way to review the order of operations that deviated from drill-like practice problems. My students found the comic funny and anticipated question 1b, asking about the operations that were missing in the actual comic. I normally deviate from using the sentence “Please excuse my dear Aunt Sally” because some students automatically assume that multiplication always precedes division and that addition always precedes substraction. Because I had mentioned this to my students, several insisted on trying to create new (much more complex) sentences in question 2c to recall the order of operations. Their attempts, although somewhat unsuccessful, prompted some very nice discussions about the topic.",,
78,"Chivalry, at Least Math Chivalry, Is Not Dead! - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics",My classes had the most fun with the challenge problem. Many of my students wondered if they could use the digits and/or the operations more than once.,,

The students worked about ten minutes each day, discussing the work within their table groups. The order of operations was reviewed during the first week of school. Problems 1–3 were completed by all students, and problems 4 and 5 were completed by a subset of students as challenge/extension problems. Formal equation-solving steps were used by some students, whereas others used a more fact-family approach.",,
83,"Chivalry, at Least Math Chivalry, Is Not Dead! - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","There was a lot of discussion about problem 4, and which student was correct.

87,"Chivalry, at Least Math Chivalry, Is Not Dead! - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","I used this cartoon with sixth-grade math students at the beginning of November. Students completed this cartoon individually as a review activity for a unit test, which included order of operations. Students had approximately twenty minutes to complete the questions before we went over answers together as a class. They checked their own work, which I collected later. Before beginning the math questions, we had a discussion about the word “chivalry.” Students knew this word in relation to King Arthur and his knights, but they did not know the word in terms of “manners” and etiquette.",,
88,"Chivalry, at Least Math Chivalry, Is Not Dead! - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Almost all students correctly answered all parts of problems 1 and 2 correctly. A few computational errors occurred, but students completely understood using order of operations. My students had not used brackets in math problems, and we had not yet studied integers, so some expressions in problem 3 were above their current knowledge. Many students attempted problem 3c, 3e, and 3f and answered them correctly. We have solved expressions this year and simple equations mentally but students do not yet know how to solve for a variable, so question 4 was beyond what they could answer.",,
89,"Chivalry, at Least Math Chivalry, Is Not Dead! - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","As an incentive to try the challenge, I told the students that anyone who correctly answered it would earn a few extra points on the unit test. Several students answered it successfully. My sixth graders had some instruction about order of operations in fifth grade, but we hit it much harder in sixth grade. Almost all of them like solving these problems because as long as you follow the rules (and correctly carry out the computations), you find the answer. One student told me that she liked this topic because it felt like she was doing “real middle school math.”",,

93,"Chivalry, at Least Math Chivalry, Is Not Dead! - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","The students in the “Numbers and Operations” course were preservice teachers. Each group was asked to “think like an upper elementary or middle school student” and worked together for about fifteen minutes. We checked through problem 3b together, and students were cautioned to be careful with mental math. I asked why a student might think that the answer to problem 3a was positive instead of negative. They realized that someone in a hurry might say “3 times 4 is 12, and 12 minus 2 is 10.” It gave us a chance to review properties and which operations were commutative and associative.",,
94,"Chivalry, at Least Math Chivalry, Is Not Dead! - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","We reviewed why the fraction bar in problem 3f was a grouping symbol. When using a calculator, if one did not define the numerator and the denominator with parentheses, the calculator would divide just the two terms on each side of the division symbol. Students also picked up on how students could misinterpret the mnemonic. Another assignment had been to read “12 Math Rules That Expire in the Middle Grades” (from the November 2015 issue). The class was split on whether or not to use “Aunt Sally.” Although some felt that the mnemonic device should be abandoned, others felt that young students often needed help to remember procedures. If one thinks of “my dear” and “Aunt Sally” as two phrases that go together, students might be less confused.",,
