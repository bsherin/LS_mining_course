Rates, ratios, and proportions, which are collectively referred to as proportionality, or proportional reasoning, are key topics for exploration in the middle grades. These topics also have applications to solutions of problems that occur in other content areas (Boyer, Levine, and Huttenlocher 2008). Proportionality is defi ned as a mathematical relation between two quantities that are related multiplicatively and that can be expressed as an equality of two ratios: a/b = c/d. The following Walk Light adventure addresses many Content Standards, as well as the Mathematical Practice of using models to solve problems “arising in everyday life” (CCSSI 2010, p. 7).",5,Can We Cross the Street in Time?

Recognizing that the crosswalk measures varied, several students suggested that they should compute the average length measurements found by three or more students. Those students said that using the average would be “fairer.” A great deal of discussion followed about whether or not averages were true indicators of actual measurements. One student noted, “They can’t be accurate. We are estimating. That’s why we have different numbers.” Approximately 70 percent of grade 6 students and almost all  grade 7 and grade 8 students successfully measured and recorded the widths of the streets whose actual distance was 35 feet.",37,Can We Cross the Street in Time?

A lack of recognition that the situations were applications of the  d = rt formula. Several students gave the product of time and distance as the rate. Some claimed that the time it took to cross the street was the rate.
