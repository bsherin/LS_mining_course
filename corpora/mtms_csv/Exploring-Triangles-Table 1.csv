2,Exploring Triangles,"Elana Reiser sSustaining student motivation has  always been challenging for mathematics teachers. One way to increase motivation is to appeal to student interests. Students of all ages are usually interested in movies and television. Research has shown that students are more motivated to learn when the material is linked to their interests (Chappell and  Thompson 2009). Therefore, including popular media in the classroom can increase motivation by making the math relevant to the students’ lives. ",2,Exploring Triangles
3,Exploring Triangles,"One way that math teachers can  use popular media in the classroom is to link mathematically oriented clips from movies and television shows to lessons. This activity uses clips from The Wizard of Oz and The Simpsons to motivate an exploration of triangle properties.

6,Exploring Triangles,"There are various ways to review this theorem. For instance, students can be given a sample triangle with side lengths of 3, 6, and x. Students can then determine what possible values the x can take on (see fig. 1). At this point, it will also be helpful to give students practice going from the wording of the theorem to writing out what they actually mean. This is a good first step to prepare them for writing mathematical proofs. I always say to “take your givens and put them in a useable form.” In this case, that would mean writing the Triangle Inequality theorem as follows:  Let x, y, and z be the lengths of the sides of a triangle. We know that  x + y > z, x + z > y, and y + z > x. ",6,Exploring Triangles

Students who are familiar with the Pythagorean theorem should realize that the statements are  incorrect. However, this activity is useful to students regardless of their knowledge  of the Pythagorean theorem because it gives them practice proving and disproving mathematical statements. ",8,Exploring Triangles
9,Exploring Triangles,"This lesson aligns with many of the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSM), including classifying triangles (CCSSM.5.G.B.4) and noticing when the conditions determine a unique triangle (CCSSM.7.G.A.2) (CCSSI 2010). Students also develop proficiency with the Standards for Mathematical Practice (SMP). They have to make sense of the problem and persevere in solving it. Students critique and correct a mathematical statement given by two characters and attend to precision as they determine the proper mathematical vocabulary to correct it. ",9,Exploring Triangles
10,Exploring Triangles,"To start the activity, make sure that students are familiar with the Triangle Inequality theorem:  understanding of the theorem, students can do some exploration on their own with sides of different lengths. A good website illustrating this theorem can be found at http:// www.mathopen ref.com/triangleinequality.html (Math Open Reference 2011). This is also a good time to discuss what exactly it means to be a theorem. Students may not have heard that term before. A theorem is a statement that has been proved from previous statements we know are true or from definitions. ",10,Exploring Triangles
11,Exploring Triangles,"Next, I show students a clip  from The Wizard of Oz in which the scarecrow gets an honorary degree in “thinkology” from the wizard. In this clip the scarecrow says, “The sum of the square roots of any two sides of an isosceles triangle is equal to the square root of the remaining side.” It may be necessary to review the definition of an isosceles triangle as well as square roots at this point. Once students have sufficient understanding, they must decide whether or not this statement is true. To do so, students can try to prove the statement if they think it is true or devise a counterexample. Since the scarecrow made a statement about all isosceles triangles instead of a single triangle, we only need to find one such isosceles triangle in which the statement is false. This may seem like an easy concept, but it actually takes a little practice to understand. Students often feel like they need to do more work because it seems too simple. ",11,Exploring Triangles
12,Exploring Triangles,"To help them get used to this idea,  ask them how to show that a statement such as the following is false: “All chairs in this room are blue.” They should realize that if only one chair is a different color, the statement is false. Then you can make the connection that for a statement to be false or, in other words, to disprove a “for all” statement, only one example needs to exist that does not satisfy the statement. It is fairly easy to ",12,Exploring Triangles

14,Exploring Triangles,"disprove the statement made by the scarecrow because, as students will see next, there are actually no cases in which this statement is true. Students only have to keep in mind that to be a triangle, the lengths of the sides must satisfy the Triangle Inequality theorem. As long as this theorem is satisfied, any values that students use will disprove what the scarecrow said. For example, if the lengths of the two congruent sides of an isosceles triangle are 16 and the base is 25, then 16 16 = + 4, but 16 16 16 16",14,Exploring Triangles

24,Exploring Triangles,"To further explore this clip, students can decide if the scarecrow’s statement is ever true. To do so, we can consider an isosceles triangle  with sides of length x2 and a base of length y2. I chose to label the sides as squares to make them easier to manipulate later on when we take the square root, but the same argu- 25 16 = + ment can be made for a triangle with lengths x and y. To assess the scarecrow’s statement, we need to know if either of these can ever be true: 16, since 9 4.",24,Exploring Triangles
25,Exploring Triangles,"5, or (i.e., if there exists an isosceles triangle where the sum of the square roots of any two sides is equal to the square root of the remaining side). These equations simplify to x + y = x and  x + x = y. The first case is easy because the equation further simplifies to  y = 0. This will never happen because a triangle cannot have a side with length zero. The second case becomes 2x = y. Squaring both sides yields 4x2 = y2. By the Triangle Inequality theorem, we know that 2x2 > y2. We also know that 4x2 > 2x2. Then by the transitive property, this becomes  4x2 > y2. We know that this is a false statement because from case 2 we had 4x2 = y2, and therefore this case will also never occur. ",25,Exploring Triangles
26,Exploring Triangles,"I then show a clip from an episode of The Simpsons (season 5, episode 10).  This scene pokes fun at the scarecrow from The Wizard of Oz. While in the bathroom, Homer finds a pair of glasses and thinks that they make him smart. He says the same thing that the scarecrow said, but someone else in the bathroom corrects Homer, saying it should be a right triangle. The new ",26,Exploring Triangles

If you have a triangle with lengths 3, 6, and x, what are the possible values of x? 2.  In the clip, the scarecrow said, “The sum of the square roots of any two sides of an isosceles triangle is equal to the square root of the remaining side.” Is this statement true?

30,Exploring Triangles,"4.  In The Simpsons clip, Homer is corrected as to the type of triangle that  should make this theorem hold true. The new statement thus becomes the following: “The sum of the square roots of any two sides of a right triangle is equal to the square root of the remaining side.” Is this statement true? Explain your answer.  5.  Is there a theorem similar to the one seen in The Simpsons that is true? statement becomes, “The sum of the square roots of any two sides of a right triangle is equal to the square root of the remaining side.” Students can try to determine if this new statement is true. ",30,Exploring Triangles
31,Exploring Triangles,"Let’s demonstrate that the statement from The Simpsons is not true. We can use an argument that is just a generalization of the one made earlier about the scarecrow’s statement, by allowing the lengths of each side to be independent. In fact, one option is to combine these two proofs into one single proof by doing this more general one first. Consider any triangle with sides of length x2, y2 and z2. According to the scarecrow and Homer, we must then have x + y = z. If we square the left-hand side of the equation, we have (x + y)2 = x2 + 2xy + y2. If we square the right-hand side of the equation, we have z2. So, we have x2 + 2xy + y2 = z2(*). Because we assumed x + y = z, then the square of the left side should equal the square of the right side, or x2 + 2xy + y2 should equal z2. The Triangle Inequality theorem, however, states that  x2 + y2 > z2 and because x > 0 and   y > 0, 2xy > 0. Then, x2 + 2xy + y2 > x2 + y2 > z2. In other words, (x + y)2 > z2, which contradicts (*). Hence, the assumption that x + y = z leads to a false statement, and therefore the statement made by Homer that x + y = z must be incorrect. I have found this proof to be the most difficult part of the activity, and most students will need hints on how to get started. Finally, I ask students if there is a similar statement to the one given in The Simpsons that is true. If they have seen the Pythagorean theorem before, students will easily be able to say that the square roots need to get changed to squares. If they are not familiar with the Pythagorean theorem, give them the correct theorem and ask them to provide several right triangles whose sides satisfy the theorem. ",31,Exploring Triangles
32,Exploring Triangles,"Through this activity, students gain a better understanding of the necessary conditions needed to make a triangle and how mathematical proof works. They will better understand the concept of disproving a mathematical statement and, even if the name is not specifically men- tioned, they will get a taste of what a proof by contradiction looks like. Exploring these questions within the context of trying to see if a television or movie character gave a correct mathematical statement makes them more enjoyable.
