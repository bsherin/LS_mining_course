Priewe wWhen teaching division of fractions,  teachers need to address issues and tensions created by trying to accomplish two important goals. The fi rst goal is to let students make sense of division of fractions on their own by working individually and in small groups, using concrete or pictorial representations, inventing their own processes, and presenting and justifying their answers and processes to one another. The second goal is to help students develop their understandings of division of fractions on a deeper level, as a multiplicative comparison, so that they develop proportional thinking.",1,Orange You Glad I DID Say Fraction Division?
2,Orange You Glad I DID Say Fraction Division?,"When comparing two quantities or numbers multiplicatively, a ratio  is involved. To help students develop their ability to compare fractions multiplicatively, we need to encourage them to think beyond iterative strategies such as repeated addition or repeated subtraction. The teacher may have to intervene at crucial points to redirect the thinking of students to focus on multiplicative relationships among fractions. ",2,Orange You Glad I DID Say Fraction Division?

4,Orange You Glad I DID Say Fraction Division?,"In this section, we illustrate ways in which four middle school students, solving division of  fraction problems in the context of servings, made sense of this operation on their own. The examples come from a larger study  by the second author (Day 2010). Because the purpose of her study was to understand how students justifi ed their strategy and solution to their peers, the teacher/researcher listened carefully but did not intervene. The teacher and students agreed that showing one’s mathematical thinking included more than producing a simple list of steps or writing an algorithm. Students communicated their thoughts through graphic representations, symbols, and words. To justify their reasoning, students applied three guiding principles:  1.  Convince themselves by devising personally meaningful solutions to problems  2.  Convince others by communicating their understanding through graphic representations, words, and symbols 3.  Make sense of other students’  justifi cations to raise challenges if disagreements occurred",4,Orange You Glad I DID Say Fraction Division?
5,Orange You Glad I DID Say Fraction Division?,Story problems that are set in the  context of fi nding out how many servings can be formed with a given quantity when the size of the serving is known lend themselves to the use of measurement interpretation of division and the use of repeated subtraction to fi nd the answer. This setting has the advantage of allowing students to use concrete or pictorial representations and fi nd their own strategies (Kribs-Zaleta 2008).,5,Orange You Glad I DID Say Fraction Division?
6,Orange You Glad I DID Say Fraction Division?,"The simplest case of a measurement interpretation of division occurs when the size of the serving fi ts exactly into the amount being distributed. For example, if a serving is 3/4 of an orange and there are 4 1/2 oranges, exactly 6 servings are found. A more diffi cult situation occurs when the size of the serving does not fi t a whole number of times into the amount and a fractional remainder is leftover. Students working on problems with a fractional remainder usually struggle to make sense of the remainder in terms of the unit used to measure (serving), rather than in terms of the objects ",6,Orange You Glad I DID Say Fraction Division?

17,Orange You Glad I DID Say Fraction Division?,"Taylor’s solution of 3 1/3 was cor- rect, but she did not specify that it was 3 1/3 servings. She said that there was 1 leftover.

However, she did not specify that the remaining amount represented 1/4 of an orange when she explained it to her group. ",17,Orange You Glad I DID Say Fraction Division?
18,Orange You Glad I DID Say Fraction Division?,"Later in the discussion, Taylor continued to try to convince her group by being explicit that the remainder was not 1/4 by saying, “But it’s not a fourth of a serving.” The girls had mentioned servings before, but this was the first time they discussed a fraction of a serving. It may have helped her group understand if Taylor would have explained that a serving was 3/4 of an orange and that it took three of these 1/4 oranges to make a full serving.

19,Orange You Glad I DID Say Fraction Division?,"The students were using graphic  representations to show the remaining amount as well as symbols and words.

24,Orange You Glad I DID Say Fraction Division?,"By stepping back to consider division problems with whole numbers and interpreting the result as a fraction, students establish an important connection that is not always present. Some students will notice on their own that the same numbers appear in a division problem, such as 7 ÷ 4 appearing in the answer as 7/4. On their own, or with a teacher’s guidance, students need to realize that the fact that the same numbers appear in the original division problem and in the answer expressed as a fraction 7 ÷ 4 = 7/4 is not a coincidence. Each person’s portion in a distribution situation can be predicted by the (multiplicative) relation between objects and participants. This realization is one example of the close relationship that exists between  proportions and fractions and how the concepts are intertwined (Streefland 1991, p. 130). This realization will be a stepping-stone later when students think in terms of ratio when dividing fractions. ",24,Orange You Glad I DID Say Fraction Division?
25,Orange You Glad I DID Say Fraction Division?,"One way that teachers may help students understand the meaning of a remainder in a division of fractions problem is to direct their attention to similar problems using whole numbers. For example, consider the following problem.   A serving is 3 cupcakes. There are 7 cupcakes. How many servings are there?",25,Orange You Glad I DID Say Fraction Division?
26,Orange You Glad I DID Say Fraction Division?,"One answer is 2 servings and  1 cupcake as remainder. Students need to interpret the remainder in terms of the serving. They must realize that they need to divide the remainder by the size of the serving; in other words, the remainder also needs to be divided by the divisor. If a serving is 3 cupcakes, then 1 cupcake is 1/3 of a serving. Therefore, another answer is 2 1/3 servings. When students write the answer to  7 ÷ 3 as 2 R1, they need to realize that the 2 refers to how many servings, not cupcakes, but that the remainder 1 refers to cupcakes.  ask students to place their thoughts on hold, then help them remember or relearn how to divide fractions, so that they can continue the problem. One way to divide fractions that highlights the connection of ratio with division is using a common denominator.

They both thought the answer was 2 whole servings and 1/6 of a serving. However, Taylor at one point said 1/6 of a cup and then a minute or so later she said 1/6 of a serving. She changed what she said without even realizing it. When the teacher reminded them about the orange problem, they concluded that  they were mixing up the units. The girls realized that the 2 represented student servings whereas the 1/6 represented cups of lemonade. Taylor stated:",29,Orange You Glad I DID Say Fraction Division?

31,Orange You Glad I DID Say Fraction Division?,"Taylor’s statement “That would be cups of lemonade leftover” indicates that she realized that the remaining 1/6 represented a fraction of a cup, not 1/6 of a serving. April suggested how to deal with the remainder to express it as part of a serving when she asked, “One-sixth divided by 2/3?” The girls then contemplated the idea of dividing the remainder by the serving, but could not quite remember the procedure for dividing fractions, so they could not follow this approach.",31,Orange You Glad I DID Say Fraction Division?

35,Orange You Glad I DID Say Fraction Division?,"Later, the teacher can come back and ensure that students know and understand how to divide fractions even when they do not have access to a calculator.

38,Orange You Glad I DID Say Fraction Division?,The initial approach used by Taylor and her teammates was to use the serving as a measurement unit and then to do repeated subtraction or repeated addition to figure out how many servings of lemonade could be formed. Students need to realize that repeated subtraction can also be done in one step by using division. ,38,Orange You Glad I DID Say Fraction Division?
39,Orange You Glad I DID Say Fraction Division?,"They can refer first to a familiar  situation with whole numbers, such as how many pairs can be formed with six students. Students can easily see that the problem can be solved by repeatedly subtracting (2 from 6) or by dividing (6 ÷ 2). Students can then go back to the situation with fractions and solve  × + with a fraction calculator using the ÷ key. After simplifying, the calculator will display the answer as 3 1/3, the same number students obtained using their own method. Students need to remember that the 1/3 refers to servings of lemonade. Some fraction calculators also have the feature of division with remainder. For example, students using the ÷R key on a Casio® Fraction Mate calculator would obtain the answer 3 R 0.25. Students can recognize that 0.25 = 1/4 and realize that this remainder refers to oranges. In discussing the power of mathematical notation, Hiebert and Behr (1988) point out that mathematical symbolism can take students beyond their level of conceptual understanding.
