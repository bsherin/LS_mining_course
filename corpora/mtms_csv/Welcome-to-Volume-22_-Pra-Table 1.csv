0,Welcome to Volume 22_ Practice Informing Research - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"When you hear the phrase “practice informing research,” it probably registers within your mind that you have heard it many times before. This would make sense because NCTM has a long history of emphasizing and exploring the research-practice relationship; our very own MTMS journal has a highly regarded research department called Informing Practice. Although we believe that we have heard this phrase often, when practice and research are connected, the implicit flow of knowledge is typically from research to practice. I would like to bring the other direction of this interdependent relationship to the fore: practice informing research.",,
1,Welcome to Volume 22_ Practice Informing Research - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"At the beginning of my career in education, when I heard the word “research” in relation to teaching, I would secretly cringe. The idea of research seemed so boring and insipid; I imagined highly reserved people wearing white lab coats in a secluded room somewhere. My teaching experiences were antithetical to this subconscious image of research; teaching was active, interactive, vibrant, engaging, invigorating, nerve-wracking, and sometimes downright chaotic. For me, this idiosyncratic nature of teaching was part of its appeal. Research did not seem to have a place in the teaching that I knew. But as I delved deeper into my studies and the craft of teaching, I began to look at research denotatively as a “studious inquiry or examination” as opposed to the connotative characteristics I attributed to it. This type of research I could certainly engage in. This type of research is exciting and interesting. This type of research is necessary for the continued growth of the field.",,
2,Welcome to Volume 22_ Practice Informing Research - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Now, as a mathematics department chair, part of my duties include teaching several classes. That is partly why I have stayed in this position for several years. Many colleagues who have started in the classroom have moved on to other positions that some may consider to be “bigger” or “better” than being in the classroom. I find that although some positions may be considered bigger, there is nothing better and certainly not more important than actually teaching and engaging with students in the classroom.",,
3,Welcome to Volume 22_ Practice Informing Research - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The innumerable factors that are ever present in the classroom setting contribute to its unique challenges but they are also what make it magical. Expert practitioners have a special type of knowledge; these unique skills and proficiencies inform the countless critical decisions that teachers make every day. How does an effective classroom teacher make in-the-moment choices to address multiple, and sometimes conflicting, goals and interests on a given day, with a specific class, for a particular student? How does a teacher attend to the problem-solving, conceptual, and procedural aspects of the content through the development and enactment of practices that address curriculum, pedagogy, and assessment? How does a teacher make mathematics interesting and relevant to students’ real-world experiences while concomitantly highlighting its inherent beauty and creativity?",,
4,Welcome to Volume 22_ Practice Informing Research - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The practice-research landscape is in need of more expert practitioners who will offer their unique and invaluable perspective on how research is actually applied in situ. Those who have experience and expertise navigating the classroom have a knowledge base that must be included in the extant literature and shared with everyone in the field. We, at MTMS, are inviting you, as skilled practitioners, to share the expertise you have developed in the classroom. We want to ensure that current and future educators can benefit from your individual experiences, collective knowledge base, and the ways in which you contribute to the research and craft of teaching.",,
5,Welcome to Volume 22_ Practice Informing Research - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We are excited to share volume 22 of MTMS with you! Within this volume, there will be articles, activities, ideas, dialogue, palettes of problems, and, of course, cartoons, that are in the tradition of the quality and distinction for which MTMS is known. The combination of authors, editors, referees, journal staff, Editorial Panel, and readers is what makes this journal highly relevant to practice and befitting for the exciting and ever-growing field of mathematics education. We hope that you will read, consume, adapt, transform, and share this journal to best serve your needs. We look forward to this journal informing your practice and, more important, your practice informing this journal.",,
