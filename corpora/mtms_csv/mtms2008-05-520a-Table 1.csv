"A geoboard (namely, a square board  with holes and pegs, using rubber bands) can be concrete, modeled using square dot paper, or manipulated virtually. (For the latter, see the National Library of Virtual Manipulatives at nlvm.usu.edu/en/nav/vlibrary  .html.) Figure 1 shows a 5-peg × 5-peg geoboard. This investigation focuses on the segments created by joining one peg to another to create oblique segments. The horizontal or vertical distance between two pegs equals 1 unit in length. Figure 1 shows the four possible horizontal segment lengths on a 5-peg × 5-peg geoboard. ",1,mtms2008-05-520a,,
"The investigation begins by asking students to consider whether any other horizontal or vertical segments will have a length other than 1, 2, 3, or 4, as shown in figure 1. This question provides an opportunity to talk about the meaning of congruent. With some reflection, students will understand that any other horizontal and vertical segments are congruent to those already identified because they are equal in length. “How many congruent segments of length 3 are there?” may be a useful question to ask students to check their understanding of congruency. Have students share their strategies for determining the number of segments with length 3 and justify how they determined that there are 20. Once there is agreement that 1, 2,  gGiven a 5-peg × 5-peg geoboard, how  many different lengths can be made by stretching a rubber band to form an oblique (nonhorizontal, nonvertical) segment between any two pegs? This question launches an investigation that requires students to make connections to the Pythagorean theorem, congruence, and combinations. It also leads to the question, “Can the results be generalized to an n-peg × n-peg geoboard?” (Note that we use “n-peg × n-peg” to refer to the dimensions of the geoboard to prevent confusion with the length of the side of the geoboard, which would be n – 1.)

This also presents a good opportunity to talk about congruent triangles, since all right triangles with legs of length 1 and 3 are congruent by the side-angle-side congruence property.

"Although this activity provides many opportunities for mathematical investigation, it can be extended into algebra by having students find a generalization for how many oblique segments of different lengths can be made on an n-peg × n-peg geoboard or using dot paper. Start by asking students to explore the same question using a  3-peg × 3-peg, 4-peg × 4-peg, and  6-peg × 6-peg geoboard.

After exploring oblique segment lengths on a 3-peg × 3-peg (three possible) and 4-peg ×  4-peg (six possible) geoboard, there is a temptation to search for a generalization.

Of the oblique segment lengths, see the list in table 4. Following the examples in table 1 and table 2, we can generalize that there are (n – 1) segments with m(leg 1) = 1; (n – 1) –  1 = (n – 2) segments with m(leg 1) = 2; (n – 2) – 1 = (n – 3) segments with m(leg 1) = 3 until we have one segment with m(leg 1) = (n – 1).

"This activity helps students make connections between geometry (measurement, the Pythagorean relationship, congruence), discrete mathematics (combinatorics), and algebra (generalization). The Learning Principle of the NCTM’s Principles and Standards for School Mathematics (2000) notes,  “Students must learn mathematics with understanding, actively building new knowledge from experience and prior knowledge” (p. 20). The Standards for grades 6–8 note that students can conduct explorations using materials such as geoboards and dot paper. “Thinking mathematically involves looking for connections, and making connections builds mathematical understanding” (p. 274), which this activity also promotes. Finally, the use of multiple representations (created concretely on a geoboard, modeled visually on dot paper, and represented numerically as a length) allows for greater access to the mathematical ideas. Students for whom symbolic statements out of context do not carry much meaning can bridge from a more tangible, meaningful model. For instance, when implementing this lesson in two different classes, one of middle school teachers  and one of middle school students, we observed several people whose work with dot paper was at first nonintuitive as a means of exploring segments of varying length. After students turned to the geoboard, many “a-ha!” moments occurred as students would affix the rubber band to one peg and pivot it to other pegs to form segments of different lengths. Students bridged from experiencing this tactile object to making drawings on dot paper. Conversely, students who enjoy manipulating numbers have opportunities to make new connections through a geometric investigation.",37,mtms2008-05-520a,,
"The first part of this investigation, finding lengths of oblique segments on a 5-peg × 5-peg geoboard, can be done within a forty-five-minute period. It is necessary to introduce students to the Pythagorean relationship before teaching this lesson. On the day of the lesson before introducing the geoboard, review  solving for the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle, given the length of the legs by using the Pythagorean theorem. Tell students it is important to leave the length of nonperfect squares in exact square root form, instead of using a calculator to generate decimal approximations. It will force students to make sense of square root in the context of the observed lengths and the relationships among them.",38,mtms2008-05-520a,,
"When introducing the activity,  explain to students that they will be doing a mathematical investigation in response to the question, “How many different oblique segment lengths can be formed on a 5-peg × 5-peg geoboard?” Although students can work individually or in teams, it is interesting to compile their data as a class and list the results for the whole class to discuss. Although not all students will individually find all lengths, they are likely to come up with all 10 lengths while working in a group. At the end of the investigation, have students help summarize the combinations of lengths shown in table 1. Assigning an investigation of the 6-peg × 6-peg geoboard as homework is a good follow-up. The authors’ experiences implementing this investigation with both middle school students and with teachers of mathematics have shown it to be novel and exciting. Within a short time, participants were associating two right triangle leg lengths with a hypotenuse length so as to find oblique segment lengths. It was truly a mathematical investigation for those engaged in searching for possible lengths and determining when they had them all. ",39,mtms2008-05-520a,,
