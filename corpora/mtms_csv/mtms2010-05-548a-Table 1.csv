"Another consideration involves  one extension that is based on using powers of 2. If a class has 16 or 32 students, no adjustments are necessary. Any number of students in between requires that some students receive more than one pencil so that there will be 16 or 32 measurements. You can either randomly distribute the extra pencils or give them to students with accelerated skills or with weak measuring skills.",3,mtms2010-05-548a,,
Penciling in the actiVitY,4,mtms2010-05-548a,,
"Although the emphasis of the activity is on statistical concepts, it begins with estimation and measurement. After students estimate the length of their pencil in centimeters and inches, they measure the actual length. They record their values and those of the class in the table on activity sheet 1. Discuss with students how much their estimates differed from the actual measurements, followed by probable reasons for the differences.",5,mtms2010-05-548a,,

"Methods for finding measures of central tendency are usually taught in middle school. Determination of mean, median, and mode are often presented as rote processes. In addition, graphical representations of data, such as stem-and-leaf and boxand-whisker plots, are also introduced. However, in many instances, no conceptual meanings are associated with the algorithms or graphical methods.",7,mtms2010-05-548a,,

"This activity uses pencils of different lengths as a physical model to reinforce the concepts of mean,  median, and mode as well as stemand-leaf plots, estimation, and  measurement. Extensions are also  presented for those interested in having their students create box-andwhisker plots and explore powers of 2.  intRodUcing the actiVitY",9,mtms2010-05-548a,,
"Two factors should be considered before beginning this activity: choice of pencils and class size. Since one purpose of the activity is to have students find the mean and median lengths of pencils, do not use mechanical pencils. Use wooden pencils that have been  cut, students should next measure two strips of paper that are equal to the length of their pencil, then put their name and measurement on the strips for record-keeping purposes. It is important for students to be able to easily identify their pencil/paper strips from everyone else’s. Take one paper “pencil” from each student, organize them by length, and tape them together into one long strip. Collect the second paper “pencil” from each student, and keep them in a separate pile. The taped set should be used when finding the mean; the other set will be used when finding median and mode.",10,mtms2010-05-548a,,
PhYsical deteRMination  oF Mean,11,mtms2010-05-548a,,
"Use the long taped strip and fold it numerous times to find the mean. (See activity sheet 2.) The students simply fold the paper into the number of pieces equal to the number of observations (16 or 32). At this point, lead an informal discussion of powers of 2, since it will take either four or five folds to get 16 or 32 equal pieces, respectively. Once the paper folding is complete, students should be able to see the equal pieces while being able to view all the original pencil lengths. The  length of each equal piece is the mean. This gives a hands-on, visual way to experience the mean of a data set.",12,mtms2010-05-548a,,
"Although this method enhances stu- dents’ understanding of mean, we feel it is important to explore the concept further. Students should compare their individual pencil length with the mean and explain why there are observations both above and below the mean. ",13,mtms2010-05-548a,,
"By using pencils that are sharpened to various lengths at the start, we control the variability of the data set. If our goal is to look at evenly distributed data, we will use pencils that do not have lengths at one extreme or the other. This allows students to see that the number of pencils above the mean as compared with those below the mean is roughly equivalent. If our goal is to examine outliers, we will distribute pencils that are much shorter or much longer. Students then see that balance is more difficult to create; more pencil lengths on one side or the other of the mean will provide a physical example of skewed data.",14,mtms2010-05-548a,,
Mean and Mode,15,mtms2010-05-548a,,
"Students finish their exploration of the mean by using the mathematical formula, which involves adding all  the data and dividing by the number of pencils. (See activity sheet 3.) The total length of all the pencils can be found either by measuring the long, taped paper strip or by adding the values in the table. ",16,mtms2010-05-548a,,
"We encourage students who need additional practice with measurement to use a ruler and measure the long paper strip. Those who need practice with basic addition should add the values from the table. Either way, students can confirm the mean mathematically by finding the length of the entire strip and dividing that length by the number of pencils used to form the long strips. This gives a computational connection to the physical model they just used.",17,mtms2010-05-548a,,
"Students should place the other  class set of strips alongside each other, ordered from smallest to largest, resembling a staircase. Once the strips are in order by size, the mode is easy to spot. As discussed earlier, varying pencil lengths can elicit interesting discussions. We often give out pencils that have more than one mode or no mode at all, which allows students to see that not all data sets are unimodal. ",18,mtms2010-05-548a,,
"We find the mode at this point because students often have experience finding mean, median, and mode in that order. Varying the order that these statistics are found is often confusing for students accustomed to a specific routine. However, we feel it is important to vary these routines so that students realize that solving math problems does not always follow a set order or pattern. ",19,mtms2010-05-548a,,
"Notice that no mathematical  determination of mode is available for students to explore. From a statistical standpoint, the mode is merely a count. It is not a way to balance data and does not require calculation to find its value. In practice, the mode is best used with categorical data, such as eye color and favorite flavor of ice cream, rather than numerical data, such as length and weight. With the strips remaining in order, we now find the median. Since the data set will be an even number of observations (either 16 or 32), finding the median requires using the middle two observations. Students find the mean of the center two (8 and 9 for 16 observations, or 16 and 17 for 32 observations) to find the median. Although many students are accustomed to doing this with pencil and paper for a stem-and-leaf plot, they enjoy the process more when it is hands on. ",20,mtms2010-05-548a,,
"Traditionally, from an ordered set of data or an ordered stem-and-leaf plot, students can usually find the middle two values of an even data set and find the mean of those middle two values. This portion of the activity focuses their attention on the visual aspect of median rather than the rote memorization process. The process is still the same, but many students have to think much harder to find the median with the paper strips. ",21,mtms2010-05-548a,,
"Once students realize that their only task is to find the middle two observations and find the mean of those two, they see how the physical model connects to the mathematical process. They can connect the two middle strips, then fold the result-",22,mtms2010-05-548a,,
More pencil lengths on one side or the other of the mean illustrate skewed data.,23,mtms2010-05-548a,,
"ing strip once to get the mean length. Depending on the skill level of your students, you may want them to determine quartiles so that they can create a box-and-whisker plot. Once again, this plotting allows them to connect the traditional algorithm to the paperstrip method.",24,mtms2010-05-548a,,
"As with the exploration of the  mean, we ask similar questions regarding the median. The goal is to have students realize that exactly half as many observations are below the median as above. Use extremely short or long pencils to illustrate the effect of outliers on the mean, and then contrast the effect of outliers on the median. It is especially noteworthy for students to see that outliers affect the mean much more than they affect the median.",25,mtms2010-05-548a,,
"We conclude by revisiting the idea of the number of folds needed to find the mean. (Activity sheet 4 is appended online for this task.) As mentioned earlier, four folds are necessary for a data set of 16; five folds, for a data set of 32. At the conclusion of the activity, students create a table relating the number of folds to the number of pencils. The big payoff occurs in asking what will happen if only one pencil was in the data set. Students discover that they cannot make a fold, so a number raised to the zero power is 1.",26,mtms2010-05-548a,,
conclUsion,27,mtms2010-05-548a,,
"This activity has been highly successful in our classrooms. We enjoy getting away from working with ordinary  data sets, and our students enjoy using hands-on physical models for familiar concepts from a computational point of view. We also have the added bonus of revisiting estimation and measurement and introducing powers of 2. ",28,mtms2010-05-548a,,
