"Activities that use linear data as a model will help students understand linear functions. In this activity, students collect data and make connections to concepts used in geometry and measurement. Rather than teaching introductory algebra and geometry, this activity is intended to serve as a culminating task to reinforce material already learned. ",3,mtms2010-02-359a,,
"The Algebra Standard for grades  6–8 states that students should— •	 explore	relationships	between	symbolic	expressions	and	graphs	of	lines,	 paying particular attention to the meaning of intercept and slope; and •	 use	symbolic	algebra	to	represent	 situations and to solve problems, especially those that involve linear relationships. (NCTM 2000, p. 222)",4,mtms2010-02-359a,,
"As students work though activity sheet 1,	they	will	explore	the	behavior of transformations and algebraic relationships. ",5,mtms2010-02-359a,,
"To begin, students are placed into groups of two to four and given the materials shown in the sidebar. They should soak a tennis ball in water, roll it across a large sheet of easel-sized grid paper, and draw a line just above or below the wet path that the ball makes before the paper dries.",6,mtms2010-02-359a,,

This department’s classroom-ready activities may be reproduced by teachers. Teachers are encouraged to submit manuscripts in a format similar to this department based on successful activities from their own classroom. Of particular interest are activities focusing on the NCTM’s Content and Process Standards and Curriculum Focal Points as well as problems with a historical foundation.

Most	 students	place	the	axes	so	that	the	 line has a positive slope, although any placement is possible. Students should draw	their	axes	so	that	the	x- and the y-intercepts are readily apparent.",8,mtms2010-02-359a,,

"While	exploring	the	line,	students	 should answer questions about slope and intercepts using a variety of methods. After looking at the line on the grid paper, they will use visual estimation skills, formulas, a ruler, and the graphing calculator. They will then compare the answers found from all these methods. The questions on the activity sheet are straightforward, leading students from answers that are obtained visually to answers obtained algebraically and with technology. Students are also asked to compare answers found from other methods as they work. They will look at slopes and intercepts from varying viewpoints while using a hands-on approach to explore	concepts	previously	learned.",10,mtms2010-02-359a,,

The NCTM Standards also state that students should— •	 describe	sizes,	positions,	and	 orientations of shapes under informal transformations such as flips, turns, slides, and scaling; •	 examine	the	congruence,	similar- ity, and line or rotational symmetry of objects using transformations. (NCTM 2000, p. 232)",17,mtms2010-02-359a,,
"The	next	part	of	the	activity	promotes these connections. Students use their knowledge of algebra to develop concepts of transformational geometry. Translations, reflections, and rotations of their original line will be done physically and algebraically. While producing transformations physically, students should record their new images with colored pencils or crayons to provide a permanent physical representation of each transformation.",18,mtms2010-02-359a,,
"The easiest transformation for most students to understand is a vertical translation; it is placed first on activity sheet 2. Students should draw  a new line that moves their original y-intercept up 3 units. The new line must be parallel to the original line or it is not a translation, which requires that distance be preserved. Students will create a table of values for both their original line and the new line to emphasize that although the x-values remain	fixed,	the	y-values change with the vertical translation. The table should help students move to the sym bolic notation of  (x, y) → (x, y + 3). ",19,mtms2010-02-359a,,
"Since distance is preserved, the slope will be the same. This can be shown algebraically using the slope formula and the original coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) along with the new coordinates (x1, y1 + 3) and (x2, y2 + 3):  and ",20,mtms2010-02-359a,,
"It should be noted that a horizontal translation that creates a parallel line, although not performed here, will keep the y-values	fixed	while	changing	 the x-values. This can be an additional extension	if	the	teacher	chooses.",21,mtms2010-02-359a,,
"Rotations are usually more difficult for students to understand. In this activity, students are told that the transformation they are using is a rotation and that it is their job to find the key elements needed. They must determine the center of rotation, which is where the two lines intersect, as well as the direction of the rotation. Different curricula specify the direction of a rotation as always clockwise or always counterclockwise. Students should use the standard that has been established in their classroom. In addition to the  center of rotation, students must also determine the angle of the rotation. Students get practice using a protractor or angle ruler with this activity by measuring the angle of rotation.",22,mtms2010-02-359a,,
"A reflection over the y-axis	creates	 ordered pairs with the same y-coordinate, but the opposite x-coordinate. This provides the scenario for the third transformation that students will perform. The relationship between the ordered pairs will be discovered by students through building a table of values, similar to what was completed with the translation. The table will develop the relationship between the original and new ordered pairs. When students calculate slopes algebraically, they will find that the slopes have the same magnitude but opposite signs. It should be noted that a reflection over the x-axis	will	keep	the	same	 x-coordinates, but the y-values will change signs. Again, the slopes will have the same magnitude but different signs. Teachers can use this portion	as	an	extension	if	they	choose.	An	 additional	extension	would	be	to	show	 that the line created from a y-axis	 reflection and the line created from an x-axis	reflection	will	be	parallel.",23,mtms2010-02-359a,,
"Students often encounter difficulty drawing the reflected line. Since they are not using tracing paper, it will be necessary for them to trace the original line by pressing down hard so that the imprint will go through the easel paper. This may require more instruction than usual by the teacher. Since most state tests do not allow tracing paper or reflection devices, students must understand the process of a reflection without using manipulatives. ",24,mtms2010-02-359a,,
"The	final	transformation	explored is a dilation, which is easily accomplished by changing the scale of the grid paper. Students do not need to draw a new line for this transformation, but will build	a	table	of	values	and	explore the relationships between the ordered pairs. In this case, both the x- and y-values are multiplied by 5, and the slope of the line does not change.",25,mtms2010-02-359a,,

"This multiple representation activity	began	as	a	simple	way	to	explore	 lines. Through work with middle school students and teachers, it has grown into the unit outlined here. Teachers should be aware that each  portion of the activity requires several class periods, either near the end of the term or incrementally during the year. The grid paper can be stored easily so that as new concepts are learned, students can go back and revisit	their	previous	work	and	extend	 it to include the new mathematics. This activity provides a hands-on way to	explore	algebraic	and	geometric	 concepts and connect the two.",27,mtms2010-02-359a,,
