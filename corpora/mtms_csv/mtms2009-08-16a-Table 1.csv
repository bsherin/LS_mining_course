"One of the most difficult challenges I have faced with seventh-grade mathematics is finding authentic tasks to use when teaching integer concepts and operations. Traditional textbooks tend to introduce integer operations abstractly through additive inverses and maneuvers on a number line. Many of the reform approaches improve on this instruction by introducing operations with a concrete approach. Maccini and Hughes (2000) advocate a concrete-semiabstract-abstract approach to instruction in which plastic  tiles are used to represent positive and negative values. Take, for example, this problem: ",3,mtms2009-08-16a,,

"Worth? 7 tiles. The answer is +7° F. Other reform materials, such as the Connected Mathematics Project, have designed similar approaches. ",7,mtms2009-08-16a,,
"Although these reform approaches seem to help students remember how to perform operations, the reasons behind these steps may not be readily apparent. In particular, the reasons behind the steps to solve  −2 − (−5) = _________ are very difficult to understand. One approach is to encourage students to model the situation with 2 negative tiles. Since there are not enough negative tiles, 3 more tiles are needed to have enough to take away 5. Therefore, students would be told to use 3 negative tiles (together with 3 positive tiles so that the original quantity is not changed), then remove the 5 negatives, leaving 3 positive tiles. ",8,mtms2009-08-16a,,
"The conceptual knowledge needed to interpret these steps with meaning is difficult and somewhat counterintuitive to most students, since it involves adding 6 more tiles without changing the quantity. The steps that are introduced in the textbook become procedures that have little meaning. As a consequence of this system, I have sought  asking students to create net-worth statements of celebrities or fictional icons allows mathematics and creativity to emerge.",9,mtms2009-08-16a,,

"I created an instructional sequence that would encourage students to reinvent the rules for integer operations, in particular, addition and subtraction. In so doing, students can begin to make sense of various actions, such as taking away negatives. I found such an environment within the context of determining a person’s net worth. ",11,mtms2009-08-16a,,
Putting students’ understanding in the BlacK The integers portion of the sequence contains several characteristics that adhere to the heuristics of an instructional design theory called Realistic Mathematics Education (RME). Three RME heuristics will be defined and modeled.,12,mtms2009-08-16a,,

"What is realistic Mathematics education (rMe)? 1.  RMe suggests that instruction start with an experientially real context for  students, meaning that students do not have to have actually experienced the situation but have to be able to imagine themselves in it.  2.  the work should build students’ reasoning gradually from the concrete to  the abstract. teachers should use manipulatives, pictures, tools, and other items to reinforce students’ reasoning with imagery, not just hope that students will think in the abstract by magic. Instruction should be intentionally designed so that students reorganize their thinking progressively toward more abstract ideas.  3.  Students should be encouraged to create models of their concrete activity.  these models should become reasoning devices for more abstract thinking. (For a complete description of RMe, see Stephan et al. 2001.)",15,mtms2009-08-16a,,

"Students respond that she has a lot  of cash in the bank; she owns yachts, buildings, Harpo Studios, and so on. They usually do not mention that she probably owes money, so the teacher should ask about Oprah’s possible debt.

The first set of activities compare the net worth of two people. (See fig. 1.) Although they can be encouraged to solve the problem any way  they wish, students typically add the assets, add the debts, and subtract one total from the other total. Students begin to understand that debts reduce net worth, whereas assets increase net worth. These net worth statements present both assets and debts as positive whole numbers; situations and activities later on will introduce positive and negative signs.
