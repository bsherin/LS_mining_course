Each chapter of this book highlights one of these mathematics teaching practices. Chapters begin with research supporting the mathematics teaching practices, described in friendly and easy-to-read language. The chapters include vignettes, with transcripts, of the teaching practices in action in K–5 classrooms. Activities are also provided. Both vignettes and activities sometimes include videos online. Each chapter concludes with connecting the speciﬁ c teaching practice to promoting equity.",5,Book Reviews

9,Book Reviews,"After reviewing this book, I decided  to require it in my elementary mathematics pedagogy classes. I teach two types of pedagogy classes (one faceto-face with traditional undergraduate students and one hybrid class for adult learners). I think this book will work well for both groups since we can do the activities both in person and online. I highly recommend this book for people who desire to improve their teaching, lead professional development, or prepare elementary teachers. Nicole M. Wessman-Enzinger",9,Book Reviews

15,Book Reviews,"In What’s Right About Wrong Answers, math mistakes are transformed from individual actions that may demonstrate a lack of  understanding to group activities that  are learning opportunities. Anderson presents twenty-two activities in which students identify errors and misconceptions in mathematical work and then discuss and write about how to learn from these mistakes. Each activity contains an overview, Common Core connections, mathematical background information, a materials list, teaching notes, and suggestions for extensions. The activities are well-suited to whole- and small-group instruction. All necessary reproducibles are included.",15,Book Reviews
16,Book Reviews,"Teachers can differentiate instruction by using one or more of the three types of activities: the comic strip, “Dear Professor Math,” or sample student work. In each activity, students are engaged in solving a problem, examining sample student work, discussing the errors they see, and communicating a plan to ﬁ x those errors. Each activity also includes a writing opportunity, which helps prepare students for extended-response items on math assessments. Teachers will appreciate the detailed teaching notes that include questions to ask during the activity and information on how the lesson builds from previously known to future mathematics.",16,Book Reviews
17,Book Reviews,"The variety of mathematical  topics and the ability to differentiate instruction through the three types of error-analysis activities make this a valuable resource for teachers in grades 4 and 5. I highly recommend this book to teachers who are interested in developing their students’ growth mindset, encouraging high-level mathematical discourse, and discovering how to use students’ mistakes as learning opportunities.",17,Book Reviews
