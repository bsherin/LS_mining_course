20,Shapes and Sizes,"This department shares creative solutions to the problems in Solve It. Edited by  Annie Perkins, annie.k.perkins@gmail .com, and Pamela J. Wells, wellsp@ gvsu.edu, Grand Valley State University, Allendale, Michigan.  nNear the end of the 2016–2017   school year, eighth-grade students in Katherine Rockey’s classes at Jenison Junior High school in Jenison, Michigan, worked on the Shapes and Sizes problems from the March 2017 issue of Mathematics Teaching in the Middle School. In this set of problems, students were asked to create parallelograms, triangles, and trapezoids, subject to certain constraints, and then to compare the shapes they made. Rockey introduced the problem by telling the students that she wanted them to work individually or with a partner and that they were to clearly communicate their thoughts through their writing. Rockey was interested in seeing what the students could do on their own and so limited her intervention to a few questions: She encouraged students to check and see if the shapes really were the same, and she reminded students to clearly explain their thinking.",20,Shapes and Sizes
21,Shapes and Sizes,"The first problem asked students  to create two nonrectangular parallelograms that had an area of 24 square centimeters and a base of 6 centimeters. Students were then asked to determine which of the parallelograms had the largest perimeter. All the students realized that with a base of 6 cm, the height needed to be 4 cm to have an area of 24 square centimeters. About 25 percent of the students, though, struggled to find more than one parallelogram that met these constraints. Other students found two different parallelograms but stated that both parallelograms had the same perimeter since the base and the height were the same for each parallelogram. Many of the students who had this misconception labeled their drawings with the height being the length of the nonbase sides of the parallelogram rather than being the perpendicular distance between a pair of parallel sides. A common misconception is to think that shapes with the same area must have the same perimeter. ",21,Shapes and Sizes

24,Shapes and Sizes,"One student expressed that reasoning in this way, “Both parallelograms are equal in perimeter. They are equal because it is impossible to get a base of 6 and an area of 24 without using 4.” A sizeable number of students  realized that it was possible to create two noncongruent shapes that fit the constraints and that the perimeters of the shapes were not the same. For example, Brandon drew two parallelograms with a base of 6 and  a height of 4 and realized that the parallelogram that was less rectangular had the larger perimeter since it was “more stretched out.” Figure 1 shows several groups of students’ work on the parallelogram problem. Nora created two noncongruent parallelograms that fit the constraint (see fig. 1a) and then used the Pythagorean theorem (you can see her work faintly in the lower-left corner near her parallelograms) to find the length of the ",24,Shapes and Sizes
25,Shapes and Sizes,Fig. 2 Student work on the triangle problem relied on visual inspections.,25,Shapes and Sizes
26,Shapes and Sizes,"(a) Emma and Megan’s work (b) Emily’s work sides of each parallelogram. She stated, “Drawing the first one was very simple. I guessed at where the angle of the line should be, and it worked. I tried to stay close to that shape and didn’t get it right until I made a larger tilt. The second one has a larger perimeter, which makes sense because it is the same height but the sides are more stretched.”  Nora persevered and problem solved to determine that parallelograms can have the same base and height but different perimeters, depending on the slope of the line segments used to create the shapes. Similarly, two pairs of students, Devin and Samantha,  and Isaac and Dom, created two parallelograms to fit the constraints. These pairs of students clearly and correctly labeled the height of the parallelograms. Devin and Samantha appeared to use a ruler to measure the nonhorizontal sides of one of their parallelograms (see fig. 1b). Isaac and Dom appeared to use the Pythagorean theorem (based on the level of precision of their side lengths) (see  fig. 1c). Please note that although Devin and Samantha’s parallelograms met the constraints of the problem, they incorrectly listed the area of the parallelogram on the left; and because they used a ruler to measure the perimeter, they got a measurement that was less precise. ",26,Shapes and Sizes
27,Shapes and Sizes,"The second part of the Shapes  and Sizes problem involved creating scalene triangles with an area of  12 square centimeters and a base of  4 centimeters. Students were then asked to determine which of the triangles had the largest perimeter. All students were able to create multiple triangles that met these constraints (although a few students created sketches of triangles that would not exist if drawn to scale because they violated the triangle inequality). This greater degree of success with this problem may be, in part, because of the students’ level of familiarity with the perimeter and area of triangles. In fact, one group of students, after working on the triangle problem, realized that shapes with the same  area could have different perimeters; they went back to the parallelogram problem to modify their solution on the basis of this observation.",27,Shapes and Sizes
28,Shapes and Sizes,"Several students still clung to  the misconception that shapes with the same area must have the same perimeter. One student, for example, created two very different looking triangles that met the constraints (one was a right triangle, and the other was obtuse) and stated, “The perimeters of each triangle are the same because if you use the formula to find the area of a triangle, the base must be 4 and the height must be 6 to be multiplied and divided by 2 to get 12 and meet the requirements.” ",28,Shapes and Sizes
29,Shapes and Sizes,"Emma and Megan worked together to create three different obtuse triangles that met the constraints. They clearly labeled their heights of  6 cm and determined that the triangle that had an angle closer to 90 degrees had the smallest perimeter. This pair did not compute the actual perimeters, but relied on visual inspection (see fig. 2a). Emily similarly created three triangles (one acute, one right, and one obtuse) and stated, “The right triangle has the smallest perimeter because the sides extend the shortest distance possible without going above or below what is required.” Emily also reasoned visually rather than numerically (see fig. 2b). In fact, there was little evidence that any of the students used the Pythagorean theorem to calculate side lengths or used a ruler to measure side lengths. ",29,Shapes and Sizes
30,Shapes and Sizes,The final portion of the Shapes and Sizes problem asked students  to create two noncongruent isosceles trapezoids with a perimeter of  20 centimeters and compare their areas. This problem was different from the previous two problems in that it gave the desired perimeter and asked students to find the areas of the trapezoids that they created. This problem posed several difficulties for ,30,Shapes and Sizes
31,Shapes and Sizes,"Rockey’s students. Many of them could create trapezoids that fit the constraints but, similar to the parallelogram problem, they failed to differentiate the length of the sides from the height of the trapezoid. Many students knew the formula for the area of a trapezoid and used it to find the areas of the trapezoid they drew, but most students used the length of the nonparallel sides as the height, so the areas they found did not match the trapezoids they drew. A few students also created sketches of trapezoids that would not exist if drawn to scale since they violated the triangle inequality. Several students did distinguish between height and side length, but these students ended up with trapezoids whose perimeter was close to, but not exactly, 20 cm. Figure 3 shows some variations on student work for this problem. Overall, students in Rockey’s  classes showed that they understood geometric vocabulary; were able to create shapes to meet certain constraints; and could use area formulas to calculate areas of parallelograms, triangles, and trapezoids. Two common misconceptions arose:   1. Students confused the side length and the height of a shape; and 2. Students assumed that shapes with the same area had to have the same perimeters. ",31,Shapes and Sizes
32,Shapes and Sizes,Problems such as these encourage students to engage with geometric concepts in deep ways. They are asked to create multiple shapes that meet the same constraints and then compare them on the basis of another attribute. These types of problems also allow misconceptions to surface for discussion since students are asked to create and label their own shapes rather than just calculate shapes that are already drawn and labeled for ,32,Shapes and Sizes
33,Shapes and Sizes,Fig. 3 Student work on the trapezoid problem contained correct and incorrect solutions.,33,Shapes and Sizes
34,Shapes and Sizes,"(a) These students labeled the height correctly and used the formula for the area of a trapezoid correctly. They also realized that the two shapes did not have the same area. However, the perimeters of these shapes are both a bit larger than 20 cm (approximately 21.66 cm for trapezoid 1 and approximately 20.83cm for trapezoid 2).",34,Shapes and Sizes
35,Shapes and Sizes,(b) This pair of students created two trapezoids with the correct perimeter and correctly predicted which shape would have the larger area.,35,Shapes and Sizes
36,Shapes and Sizes,"(c) This student created three trapezoids with the correct perimeter, but found the areas using the side length rather than the height of each trapezoid.",36,Shapes and Sizes
37,Shapes and Sizes,them. Students also are encouraged to make connections as they work to determine the length of sides that are not oriented horizontally or vertically.,37,Shapes and Sizes
38,Shapes and Sizes,We would like to thank Katherine Rockey and her students for sharing their work on these problems.,38,Shapes and Sizes
39,Shapes and Sizes,The willingness of teachers and  students to share their work and their use of the task with MTMS readers benefits the mathematics education profession. It also allows us to provide other middle school math teachers with insights into the use of nontraditional tasks and into the thinking  of students.,39,Shapes and Sizes
