Rental companies receive a large discount if they buy all their cars from one manufacturer. They also want to buy cars with good overall fuel economy to satisfy their customers. The fuel efficiency of a vehicle is measured by determining its miles per gallon (mpg). Use the data in the table at right to determine whether Ford  or Chevrolet offers more fuel-efficient cars.  car class,2,mtms2012-04-576a,,

Suppose the rental company  knows that 95% of its business is from small cars and that 5% is from all other types of vehicles. The rental company also  knows that within each category (e.g., small car or other), a renter is equally likely to choose any vehicle (i.e., he or she is just as likely to choose the Chevy Volt as the Chevy Sonic).
