5,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (December 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Bridging the gap between educational research results and classroom practices is a great achievement of Edward A. Silver and Patricia Ann Kenneys book, More Lessons Learned from Research: Useful and Usable Research Related to Core Mathematical Practices. The authors compiled, summarized, and presented research studies in a form that is relevant to teachers and can lead to improving the practice of teaching some core mathematics concepts.",,
6,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (December 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","The studies addressed issues such as what constitutes mathematical proofs and reasoning; how to validate mathematical arguments across all grade levels; discourse and the nature of interactions in mathematics classrooms that facilitate learning; mathematical concepts and pedagogical approaches that help students make sense of mathematics; and the strategic use of tools, modeling, and problem-solving strategies.",,
7,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (December 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","This book is especially relevant for mathematics educators, classroom teachers, and curriculum designers if they are seriously considering how to address the implementation problems of some of the unfamiliar concepts featured in the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics. One major highlight of this book is that it brings together studies that address topics (especially proofs) that most Kgrade 12 teachers find difficult to handle; thus, it is important for successful mathematics pedagogy.",,
8,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (December 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","However, some studies, although relevant for effective teaching and learning, do not appropriately fit within their respective sections of the book. Furthermore, in addition to summarizing the research, the authors could make this book more relevant to Kgrade 12 teachers by being more specific in suggesting how teachers could use these research results in mathematics classrooms.",,

15,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (December 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Problem-Solving Strategies in Mathematics: From Common Approaches to Exemplary Strategies proposes ten commonly known problem-solving strategies and how they can best be used to solve problems in elementary mathematics. The strategies covered (which are also the titles of the chapters) include Logical Reasoning, Pattern Recognition, Working Backwards, Adopting a Different Point of View, Considering Extreme Cases, Solving a Simpler Analogous Problem, Organizing Data, Making a Drawing or Visual Representation, Accounting for All Possibilities, and Intelligent Guessing and Testing.",,
16,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (December 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Each of the ten chapters, one per strategy, begins with a description of the strategy and how it can be applied to some real-world, everyday situations. Then a variety of problems are presented, each of which would best be solved using the particular strategy. Following this, the authors share the most common approach to solve the problem, followed by a more exemplary solution that demonstrates how the problem-solving strategy under consideration will lead to the answer.",,
17,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (December 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","I recommend this book to anyone interested in furthering his or her understanding of problem-solving strategies. I would encourage those individuals to read the book, become familiar with the ten strategies, and then spend some time working through the given problems before reviewing the solutions provided because it will most likely offer some new insight and thinking into the problem.",,

23,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (December 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","This book made research-to-practice connections in user-friendly language. Although relevant research was used to develop a unit on area, volume, and nets, the book remained easy to read and is ready to use in a sixth-grade classroom.",,
24,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (December 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Included in the book is all relevant material for ten days of lessons. Mini-lessons of multiplication number strings are also included. These lessons involve students in creating their own models as architects; making conjectures; and building mathematical ideas about area, volume, and nets. Lessons are rooted in student-relevant contexts, like building and examining various nonrectangular sun decks.",,
25,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (December 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","In addition to explicit alignment with the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics and illustration of the mathematical landscape, a benefit of this book is attention to the strategies that students use for finding area (e.g., filling and counting, skip counting, using partial products, and so on). Excerpts of student-teacher transcripts and interactions will help the reader understand how students think about the mathematics and how teachers can facilitate their understanding.",,
26,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (December 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Another strength found throughout the entire book is the explicit attention to mathematical modeling. It is described through three stages of development: the model of the situation, the model of students strategies, and the model as a tool for thinking. These distinctions are helpful in two ways: when deciding how to model the situation and how to analyze students modeling strategies as well as when helping students make important mathematical connections.",,
27,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (December 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","If you wish for a series of lessons to facilitate students as mathematicians as they learn area, volume, and nets, I highly recommend this book.",,

34,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (December 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Sean Connolly, in presenting The Totally Irresponsible Science Kit, cites The Oxford Dictionary of English in defining science as the intellectual and practical activity encompassing the systematic study of the structure and behavior of the physical and natural world through observation and experiment. Continuing, he notes that the kit carries on the noble tradition of scientific exploration and takes it to new, yet familiar, areas. He describes his choice of irresponsible activities as being fueled by curiosity and imagination, but noting the necessary due care and attention in each experiment.",,
35,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (December 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","The kit is designed for ages 9 and up and includes a plastic cup, a capped test tube, a teaspoon, protective goggles, and a book of experiments. It is suggested that the experiments are for children as well as adults, but they are not to be conducted by children without adults. Consequently, the kit and experiments are wonderful vehicles for parent-student bonding in the mutual pursuit of science.",,
36,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (December 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","One of the experiments involves making a cola geyser. It uses Mentos candies, a two-liter plastic bottle of diet cola, a test tube (included in the kit), a two-inch square of cardboard, and photon-refracting goggles (included in the kit). The Mentos are dropped into the cola bottle when the cardboard is removed. Experimenters are then told, Take care to know which way to run. Run clear and watch as the cola explodes out of the bottle. The author then discusses scientifically why and how the experiment works. The experiment is not only eye-opening but the science behind it is well explained; in total, it is a productive learning opportunity.",,
37,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (December 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics",Many of the experiments are surprising. The kit would be an enticing family science motivator.,,
