"The Connections Standard in grades 6–8 in Principles and Standards for School Mathematics recommends that middle school students “recognize and apply mathematics in contexts outside of mathematics” (NCTM 2000, p. 274). This goal can be reached by providing students with rich problem contexts that involve connections to the real world (NCTM 2000). To find such contexts, mathematics teachers can look to the local community, because our culture influences the mathematics we do and influences the issues that are important to us. If teachers present students with interdisciplinary experiences within the context of local community issues, students will understand the usefulness of mathematics and it will help them develop the skills and knowledge necessary to become active participants in their communities (Zaslavsky 1996).",3,mtms2007-12-270a,,
"To identify topics that are relevant to our local society, I rely on my knowledge of local issues that routinely appear in the community newspaper. Construction of new roads, resurfacing existing roads, land use, and planning and development are issues that are consistently addressed in the local community. These social issues provide a rich context for connecting mathematical activities to the real world.",4,mtms2007-12-270a,,

"During the summer, I worked with a class of sixth-, seventh-, and eighthgrade students. About half the students were in sixth grade, about half were in eighth grade, and the remaining few were in seventh grade. The school, located in a rural community, faces a state highway that traverses the county. We ",6,mtms2007-12-270a,,
"Greg Harrell, gharrell@valdosta.edu, teaches mathematics in the mathematics and computer science department at Valdosta State University, Valdosta, GA 31698. He is interested in helping students build strong mathematical connections and see the relevance of mathematics in our society. PHotoGrAPH by SHerry HArrell; All riGHtS reSerVed spent two one-hour class periods on the activities described here.",7,mtms2007-12-270a,,
"Our initial class discussion focused on the general role of local government in society. Using the local newspaper as a reference, we discussed new road construction, existing road resurfacing, land use, and planning and development as important community issues. The class discussed why a community, through its local government, wants to construct new roads, resurface existing roads, define how land can be used through zoning laws, and plan for development. After a brief discussion, the following questions were left open for the students to consider further: 1.  Why do we build new highways  and streets? 2.  What are the pros and cons of  building these highways and streets?",8,mtms2007-12-270a,,
"Students stated that we build new roads to be able to “get where we are going.” They also discussed that private landowners lose their land when a new road is constructed. The highway in    Mathematics social Issues front of the school traverses the county, thereby providing access to two cities within the county, cities outside the county, and the school itself. In addition, the highway uses a large amount of land. I posed the question, “How much land is used by the highway in front of our school as it traverses the county?” In our community, land is bought and sold in acres, a customary unit of area measure, yet only one or two students could visualize the area of one acre. Without first being able to visualize the size of the unit of measurement, students would find any estimations involving acres to be meaningless. I developed the following activity so that students could visualize an acre, which would enhance their ability to estimate area using acres. ",9,mtms2007-12-270a,,
MeasureMent and estIMatIon to VIsualIze acres,10,mtms2007-12-270a,,
"We started the process of visualizing and estimating with acres by first looking at square feet, a customary unit of area measurement that was more familiar to the class. The students  worked in groups of three to four to complete the worksheet “How Big Is an Acre?” in their project journals.",11,mtms2007-12-270a,,
"Although the students were familiar  with a square foot, they were not comfortable visually estimating the area of the classroom in square feet. Using a 25-foot tape measure, most of the groups obtained 25 ft. × 25 ft. = 625 sq. ft. for the area of the classroom, and one group obtained 28 ft. × 25 ft. = 700 sq. ft. Using these measurements, they found that 43,560 sq. ft. per  acre ÷ 625 sq. ft. per classroom ≈ 70,  or 43,560 sq. ft. per acre ÷ 700 sq. ft. per classroom ≈ 62, of our classrooms that will fit in one acre. ",12,mtms2007-12-270a,,
"The difference in area measurements created some discussion when between-group comparisons were made. The students expected one correct answer, so their discussion was framed within the context of determining which group measured correctly. As they compared their measurement techniques to determine the source of the difference, the students discovered that the group that found the larger area had measured the 12  ft. × 3 ft. recessed space along the 25foot wall. The recessed space is used for storage and is sometimes closed off with a curtain, so the groups with the smaller measurement did not consider it to be part of the classroom. Although the students obtained different area measurements for the classroom, they did not agree that all measurements are estimates. They reasoned that the classroom has an exact area, so there is one exact measurement. Although the 25-foot tape measure is marked to measure to the nearest sixteenth of an inch, all the students measured to the nearest foot. As a class, we discussed that if a smaller unit is used, say, an inch, then we would obtain a different, more precise measurement. Similarly, using a halfinch, quarter-inch, eighth-inch, and sixteenth-inch unit would provide successively more precise measurements. Our length and width measurements are then estimates whose precision is controlled by the size of the unit.",13,mtms2007-12-270a,,
"After completing the group activity, we gathered as a class to plan how to estimate the size of the school  campus in acres by first marking off an acre so we could see our measurement unit. Since the area of one acre is 43,560 square feet, we decided to mark off a square with side length  43 56 0 ft.",14,mtms2007-12-270a,,

"I mentioned that a variety of professionals use their own bodies as measurement tools while working, and that many of them develop this skill through repetition (Adams and Har- a flag at an initial vertex A. I asked the students to form three groups of five. I placed the start of a 25-foot tape measure at vertex A and extended 24 feet of the tape measure out toward the desired unknown vertex B. To estimate the 210-foot distance, the students started walking from vertex A alongside the tape measure. They had a distance of 24 feet to walk to develop a cadence for their 2-foot or 3-foot gait as well as to get a straightline bearing toward unknown vertex ",16,mtms2007-12-270a,,
"Construction of new roads, resurfacing existing roads, land use, and planning and development are just a few of the potential social issues that can provide a rich context for connecting mathematical activities to the real world rell 2003). I then suggested that we use our own bodies in the same way by walking off steps that are 2 feet or 3 feet, depending on our gait. As a class, we chose 210 feet as an approximation to the side length because it is divisible by both 2 and 3. ",17,mtms2007-12-270a,,
"Before going outside, students  answered the following questions in their project journals: 1.  Find the area of a square with sides  of length 210 feet. Determine the difference in square feet between this square and an area of one acre.",18,mtms2007-12-270a,,
2.  Compute 210 ÷ 2 and 210 ÷ 3 to  determine how many 2-foot or 3-foot steps you need to make to mark off an acre.,19,mtms2007-12-270a,,
"We then went outside to pace off a 210 ft. × 210 ft. square so that the students could see an acre. We needed to place flags at the four vertices of our square, so as a class we first placed ",20,mtms2007-12-270a,,
"B. As soon as one student went past the measuring tape, I asked the next student to walk. They continued walking in the same direction for 210 ÷ 2 or 210 ÷ 3 steps. When they stopped, the students in each group ended at different locations, thus giving five potential points for vertex B. Some students were troubled by this outcome. I assured them that they were doing fine and encouraged them to think of a way to find a single point from their five points. They subsequently found a center among themselves, which gave the desired vertex B for the group. The three groups then found a center among the groups, and placed a flag at vertex B. The students continued this process of using steps to estimate 210 feet until four flags were in place to form the desired acre estimate. Since we were interested in an approximate area, we visually estimated the sides of our square to be at 90 degree angles to each other.",21,mtms2007-12-270a,,
"Once the students marked off the 210 ft. × 210 ft. acre approximation with flags, I asked them to estimate the campus size in acres and write that figure in their journals. We moved around the school grounds so that the students could see the boundaries of the campus in all directions. I explained to them that the campus size in acres includes everything within those boundaries. Some students were uncertain about how to obtain an estimate of the number of acres, so I asked them to visualize covering the entire campus with the 1-acre square that we marked off with flags. Estimates varied, but many of the student calculations were very close to the actual 15-acre size. ",22,mtms2007-12-270a,,
"Now that the students had a sense of the acre unit of area measurement, the ability to estimate linear measure by counting 2-foot and 3-foot steps, and the ability to estimate visually the area in acres, they returned to their task of determining the amount of land used by a certain road in our community.",23,mtms2007-12-270a,,
How MucH land  does a road use?,24,mtms2007-12-270a,,
"After the class had completed the acre-visualization activity and estimated the size of the school campus, the students returned to the question, “How much land is used by the highway in front of our school as it traverses the county?” They discussed what information is needed to obtain this estimate as well as the measurement tools needed. They suggested using a “large tape measure,” “the wheel thing” [trundle wheel], or needing to “count steps” to obtain the width of the highway. The students wanted to “count steps,” since it was new to them and some wanted more practice measuring in this way.",25,mtms2007-12-270a,,
"After discussing what and how to measure, we went outside to obtain a measurement of the highway width. ",26,mtms2007-12-270a,,
"For safety reasons, the students could not walk onto the highway, so I pulled one end of a long string to the end of the right of way on the opposite side of the highway while the students stayed on school grounds feeding out the spool of string. Next, the students cut the string at their end where the right of way met the school grounds. After placing the string in a straight line on school grounds, the students estimated the string length by counting the number of 2-foot or 3-foot steps required to walk the length, then multiplied by 2 or 3 feet, depending on the distance covered in one step. After each student paced off the string to obtain his or her own estimate, the students shared their results with one another. One eighthgrade student recorded 120, 120, 108, 117, 115, 120, and 117 feet. He computed the mean of these distances to be “116 R5,” but his group included several sixth graders who chose to use the mode of 120 feet for their width estimate, since “more people got it.” Other students obtained 125 feet for their width estimate.",27,mtms2007-12-270a,,
"Once back inside the classroom,  students worked in groups using county highway maps, rulers, and pieces of string to obtain an estimate of the length of the highway in miles from one end of the county to the other. Most students had difficulty seeing where the highway intersected the county line on the map. In figure 1, one student marked the map in blue ink (blue highlight added) to mark the start and end of the highway within the county. Many students also had difficulty locating and using the scale on the map. The map was scaled so that 3 inches equaled 40 miles, with the 40-mile scale broken into 10-mile increments. The students cut a string that was the same length as one of the 10-mile increments, then used the string to count the number of 10-mile sections ",28,mtms2007-12-270a,,

"P, on the highway. Estimates varied depending on how well the students followed the curvature of the highway and how the students chose to calculate the fraction of the final 10-mile string measurement. Also in figure 1, another student marked the map at the end of the string placement (yellow highlights) as she obtained an estimate of 30 miles. Using the 10mile-string scale, some students saw  2 1/2 strings, others saw 3 strings, while one student measured 3 1/4 strings. Instead of using a 10-mile string to measure, some students placed a longer piece of string on the entire length of the highway, cut the string, and placed it on the 40-mile scale to determine the length of the highway. ",30,mtms2007-12-270a,,
"After obtaining the width of the  highway in feet and the length of the highway in miles, some groups converted the width to miles, found the area in square miles, and converted square miles to acres. One group used its 120-foot highway width estimate, which converted to 0.0227 miles, and 30-mile length estimate to obtain an area of 0.681 square miles, or 436 acres (see fig. 2). More than half the groups converted the length to feet, found the area in square feet, and converted square feet to acres. One group performed the following calculations:  30 × 5280 = 158,400 feet 158,400 × 125 = 19,800,000 square feet 19,800,000 ÷ 43,560 = 455 acres",31,mtms2007-12-270a,,
Fig. 2 An eighth grader’s calculations of highway acres,32,mtms2007-12-270a,,
The students could perform these calculations using either the paperand-pencil algorithms or a calculator. The groups were noticeably more comfortable finding different results from their peers than they were on earlier activities.,33,mtms2007-12-270a,,

"Once the students had a sense of the amount of land taken up by the highway, our class revisited the questions from our initial discussion, “Why do we build new highways and streets?” and “What are the pros and cons of building these highways and streets?” To explore these questions in your classroom, consider collaborating with your school’s social studies teachers. Taking private land for public use is a contentious issue in society. By placing the activity “How Much Land Does a Road Use?” within the context of new road construction, students may see mathematics deeply intertwined with an important social issue. ",36,mtms2007-12-270a,,
"Either the collaborating teachers or the students can propose a variety of new roads, from new city streets to four-lane highways that bypass the city. Proposed roads need to have a defined benefit for the local community. The proposed new roads may be drawn on a city or county map. By inspecting the map, students can see existing facilities that the proposed road will traverse, such as parks, hospitals, schools, or residential areas that are important to the public. Students may then address the question, “If this road is proposed for our city, will you support it or oppose it?”",37,mtms2007-12-270a,,
Students may work together to address the following: 1.  Calculate how many acres of land  this road will require. How does this number compare with the size of our school campus? 2.  Discuss the benefits (pros) and  costs (cons) of building the road as proposed.,38,mtms2007-12-270a,,
3.  Try to find a better route for the proposed road. What makes your route better?,39,mtms2007-12-270a,,
"In general, communities construct  new roads and streets to promote growth or meet the needs of growth. ",40,mtms2007-12-270a,,
"Determining the costs of building a new road can lead to some interesting discussions. Some potentials costs include (a) financial cost; (b) loss of current facilities, such as schools and parks; (c) loss of wildlife habitat; and (d) loss felt by homeowners. All homeowners value their homes, yet some people may be forced out because of road construction. Will homes in poor neighborhoods or affluent neighborhoods be taken for the road construction? Should one neighborhood be given preference over another?",41,mtms2007-12-270a,,
"Finally, students could attend a  meeting of city or county government leaders to see the decisions made concerning new road construction, existing road resurfacing, and zoning changes. In social studies class, students can role-play the positions of city and county leaders to debate and vote on road building, road resurfacing, and land rezoning proposals. In this way, they can learn how to be active participants in our government.",42,mtms2007-12-270a,,
conclusIons,43,mtms2007-12-270a,,
"These activities provide rich connections for students as they see mathematics in action within their local community. As the students progressed through the activities, they became much more aware of and confident in their ability to estimate without formal measurement tools. They also became much more comfortable with the notion that different answers are possible in mathematics. This led them to be more confident in their own mathematics work as they became less likely to think, “Others got something different, my answer must be wrong.” ",44,mtms2007-12-270a,,
"The “Acre Visualization” and “How Much Land Does a Road Use?” activities were accessible to our sixth-grade students. Although some concepts, such as square root and mean, were unfamiliar, they did not prevent students from completing the activities. ",45,mtms2007-12-270a,,
"For example, after receiving the hint to “compromise,” students reasoned that the five must come together to form a single vertex when finding the first vertex of the square acre outside. When faced with multiple measures of the highway width, they conferred with other students, including eighth graders, and chose the width that occurred most often (the mode) as their group’s highway width.",46,mtms2007-12-270a,,
"At the end of the activities, students were given the opportunity to write comments about the activities. Two negative comments centered on not liking to “measure things.” All the other students stated that they liked the activities because they “had fun” or because they “learned something new.” The students enjoyed going outside. They also liked learning “how much an acre is,” “how long the highway is,” and “how big the school grounds are.” ",47,mtms2007-12-270a,,
"The social studies activities require problem solving, communication, and reasoning skills. In discussing the issues related to building roads, students face a complex issue in which competing values are at play, so the discussion is best presented as a decision-making activity with no right or wrong answer. Sometimes the community thinks that the benefits of highway construction are worth the cost to the environment, finances, and landowners; at other times, the community does not think that the benefits justify the costs. Decisions must be made on a case-by-case basis; some competing values win and some lose when the decision is made. Similarly, the process of rezoning land is often a political process. The political context of the social studies activities, for which there is no single correct answer, helps promote important ideas in mathematics,  such as “measurements are estimates” and “sometimes multiple answers are possible.” ",48,mtms2007-12-270a,,
