"Inevitably, a homework exercise or class example will ask students to find the absolute value of 0. Students will then be forced to modify the statement that opened this article, because 0 is neither positive nor negative. The new statement will be, “The answer is always positive or 0.” Keep in mind, however, that these statements are generated by students, reflecting a pattern that they are seeing when finding the absolute value of real numbers.  xxxxx 1 1 or",4,mtms2008-11-234a,,
This is the formal arithmetic definition of absolute value:  if if 00,5,mtms2008-11-234a,,
"However, seeing −x in the definition confuses many students (Sink 1979),  because it seems to be incompatible with their own observations and experiences. Stallings-Roberts notes that few “students understand the significance of x < 0 as a critical part of the definition” (1991, p. 303). Yet even after discussing with students the role of –x, few will adopt the formal arithmetic definition of absolute value over their own because it works with real numbers. Once students begin to work with absolute value equations and inequalities, they will need to transition from thinking that the answer is always positive or 0 to thinking, more precisely, that it is the absolute value that is always positive or 0.

How many times have teachers been  frustrated by students incorrectly rewriting a problem such as |2x + 3| = 5 as 2x + 3 = 5 only? Or taking a problem such as |2x + 3| = −5 and changing it into 2x + 3 = 5? Perhaps |2x − 3| = 5 rewritten as 2x + 3 = 5 seems more familiar. Note how all these typical student mistakes stem from their initial point of reference as they try to ensure that there are no ,7,mtms2008-11-234a,,

Not only that, but many students are perplexed and discouraged when they find that the absolute value equation |2x + 3| = 5 can be rewritten as both 2x + 3 = 5 and 2x + 3 = −5, and that the answer is both x = 1 and x = −4. One can almost hear students silently wonder, “But I thought you could only have positive numbers as answers to absolute value questions; why is it OK now to have a +1 and a −4?” Students will, in good faith, try to remember to rewrite an absolute value equation into two equations to find the solutions to the problem.

"Unfortunately, the low point in this journey is reached later, as Friedlander and Hadas note: The “solving of inequalities that involve absolute values frequently turns out to be an unrewarding experience for both algebra teacher and algebra student” (1988, p. 212). The challenge becomes to anchor students’ thinking about absolute value in such a way that this initial point of reference remains consistent when they are evaluating ",10,mtms2008-11-234a,,

"The importance of this concept  with respect to other mathematical ideas cannot be understated. For example, students will need to understand absolute value when working with complex numbers and vectors. Wallace (1988) notes how the definition of a limit depends on this concept. Arcidiacono (1983) uses piecewise functions to help students visually understand absolute value. Horak (1994) describes how a graphing calculator can help students find solutions to absolute value equations when understood as a system of equations. Wei (2005) shows how the solutions of two types of absolute value equations are linked directly to the foci of an ellipse and hyperbola. An important point to make is that without fail, these authors use the number line or Cartesian coordinate system as a key tool to provide their readers with insights about, or strategies for, teaching this important concept.

"The focus of this article is an activity from an algebra class. Students use one point of reference and a number line constructed with sticky notes to help them solve some typical absolute value exercises found in algebra textbooks (see fig. 1).

Noting that the direction in which they moved and their starting points were different for each student, redirect their thinking by asking them to share some of the commonalities in what they all did. Once they share that every person took three steps, emphasize these points:  1.  Absolute value does not care which  way they move. ",14,mtms2008-11-234a,,
"This opening to the activity begins  2.  Absolute value just wants to know  before students walk into the classroom. Ask them to spread out single file on the sidewalk and share what absolute value means to them. After hearing their different points of view, direct them to take three steps in any direction; if most students move in the same direction, ask them to go back to where they were, tell them to be creative, and direct them again to take three steps. Then, have students point with one arm in the direction that they moved and ask them why, after taking three steps, they did not end in the same place. Eventually someone will say that everyone had a different  how far they moved from the starting point.",15,mtms2008-11-234a,,
"Once students are settled in the  classroom, ask them to refer to a portion of a dashboard, shown in figure 2. Share with the class that the odometer of your car showed 59087 miles (write this number on the left-hand side of the board) and that you drove your car for two miles. Simulating the drive by walking to the right-hand side of the board, ask the class to tell you the number of miles that the odometer would now show: 59089. You decided to put the car in  reverse and drove in this manner for two miles. After simulating the drive back to the left-hand side of the board by walking backward, ask the students to tell you how many miles would now appear on the odometer. Write on the board the actual miles that would show on the odometer: 59091. Conclude by explaining that although a car can be driven in reverse, the odometer does not care which direction the car is moving, only in how far the car is moving. In effect, every time one drives an automobile, the odometer is a real-life application of absolute value.  estAblishinG the concePt oF AbsolUte VAlUe “What do you mean by distance from 0?” In this part of the activity, begin by defining absolute value as the distance from 0 on the number line and introducing the symbol | | that is used with this concept.

"Ask the students to share what  they know about number lines, which will help them connect this definition with ideas learned in the previous activity. Give each student a marker and sticky notes. Draw a line with arrows at each end and mark the starting point of the number line with 0. Face the class and ask students which way one should move and how many steps one should take with a number such as −3 if the starting point is 0. After students say that one would move to the left three steps, point in that direction and then take three steps. Ask the class to decide how far one moved from the starting point. If some students answer –3, you may need to clarify that the question is not asking for the direction. Repeat the process with +3. The key of this discussion is to ensure that everyone has the same understanding of the definition and to begin establishing a venue to connect their thinking from an everyday point of reference to a mathematical point ",17,mtms2008-11-234a,,

"linkinG to Prior knowledGe “How is this related to the math that I have already learned?” Before starting to solve problems with absolute value, students find it helpful to solve problems that they have previously learned. From a teacher’s point of view, the advantage is that most of the questions in this lesson will be related to absolute value ideas, as opposed to questions that have to do with past mathematical concepts or techniques.

"Students should be proficient in the following skills: graphing points on the number line, solving linear equations, and solving linear inequalities. As a class, students should review solving such problems as –3x + 4 = –8 and (2/3)x – 2 = 2. Asking students to point to the correct sticky note on their number line helps refresh students’ thinking about the strategies they have already learned. One can also solve  2x + 5 > –3 or –7 ≤ –3x – 1 < 5 by  having students take one sticky note from their number line that they consider a solution and holding it in the air for everyone to see. This leads to a discussion about why inequalities have many solutions, as compared with the equations. The discussion should help  students think about this key difference between equations and inequalities. After modeling on the board the solutions of these inequalities on a number line, remind students that even though endpoints may or may not be part of the solution set, hence the use of empty or solid circles, they must be identified on the number line. The final issue to address with students is what it means for a number or set of numbers to be a solution of an equation or inequality. It will be helpful later when students start wondering about the answers to their absolute value problems. At this point, ask students to develop a concept map in poster form, as shown in figure 4. It will facilitate subsequent discussion as a tool for reminding students how absolute value is defined and connecting relationships that exist among mathematical symbols, words, and the number line.",21,mtms2008-11-234a,,

"Write |–4| on the board. Ask students what it means, encouraging them to use the definition of absolute value and ideas from the concept map. Moving the −4 sticky note up a bit on the number line so that it stands out from the rest, ask the students how far −4 is from 0, which is the starting point. Conclude that it is four steps, or units, away from 0 by counting the sticky notes from 0 to −4. Then write, “|–4| is 4 units from 0,” shown as  |–4| = 4. Continue by showing |4| and asking the class to write down what this means. Scaffold their thinking from calling it the absolute  value of 4, to the distance from 0 to 4, to how far 4 is from the starting point of 0. The primary aim of this activity is to help students internalize these similar meanings of absolute value. Students state that the answer is always positive. Be sure to stop and ask students if they mean that the answer is always positive or if the absolute value is always positive and whether it makes a difference. This clarification will minimize future confusion as students work with absolute value equations and inequalities.  solVinG AbsolUte  VAlUe eqUAtions",23,mtms2008-11-234a,,
"The first step is to have students compare and contrast equations such as  2x + 3 = 5 and |2x + 1| = 7. The goal is to help students to recognize that these are two different types of equations; thus, they will be solved in different ways and the solutions will look different. However, the strategy is to build on what students already know about solving linear equations. The following story line helps students understand why absolute value equations can have two solutions. It also reinforces rewriting the problem into two linear equations. ",24,mtms2008-11-234a,,

Point at the equal sign and the 7 and tell students that the number line will represent the street and city blocks. Ask them to decide where they could find the pizza parlor. After raising the 7 and –7 sticky notes slightly above the others, indicate that the solutions to this problem have to be equal to 7 or –7, because we are considering two values. Then present the equation |2x + 1| = 7 and ask for ideas about its solution. Connecting to the pizza parlor example, the solution to |2x + 1| = 7 will come from  2x + 1 = 7 and 2x + 1 = –7.

"Once the two linear equations are  set up, wait for students to find the solutions of x = 3 or x = –4. If students are perplexed by the answer of –4, show that a substitution of −4 in the original problem yields –7 and how the absolute value of –7 is in fact 7, or +7.

Have them point on their number lines to the possibilities. After viewing their choices, go back to the board and move the two appropriate sticky notes on the number line. Have the class explain why you moved two notes (the pizza parlor is 5 blocks away and could be in either of two places) and how these two numbers related to the original problem (i.e., the solutions to |x – 2| = 5), will come from setting x – 2 = 5 and x – 2 = –5.

"It is important to choose problems that have integer endpoints in the original absolute value inequality problems because the sticky notes are labeled with integers. The story line will be similar to that of an equation but is adapted according to the type of inequality being solved by students.

Ask the students whether the pizza parlor can be at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and so on. In those cases where the pizza parlor could be present, raise the sticky notes. Note that the sticky note with a 3 is an endpoint for this problem, which must be identified on a number line, so raise this note, too. If there are protests from students, remind them that although the endpoint itself does not satisfy the story problem, any number right after the endpoint not shown on the sticky notes does satisfy the story (e.g., the pizza parlor could be  3 1/2, 3 1/4, and so on, blocks away). Although such discussion would have been avoided if the problem read |2x + 1| ≥ 3 instead of  |2x + 1| > 3, addressing this issue about endpoints, and when they are or are not included, is important. Remind students that an empty or solid circle over the 3 to clarify its inclusion or exclusion from the problem still requires putting either circle on the 3 because it is an  endpoint.",31,mtms2008-11-234a,,
"Continue the discussion by asking the class if the pizza parlor could be anywhere else, making sure to include any other endpoints, and begin to raise the sticky notes with a –3, –4, –5, and so on, as shown in figure 6. Remind students that numbers on a number line get smaller to the left (ﬂ) and larger to the right (‡). Below the raised sticky notes, write “smaller than –3” and “bigger than 3”; below those words, write the corresponding notation “< –3” and “> 3.” At this point, ask students to connect the original problem to values that are less than –3 or more than 3. Once students identify “the expression inside the absolute value signs” as the key, write 2x + 1 < –3 or 2x + 1 > 3, then have them solve each inequality to get x < –2 or x > 1. Finally, verify with students that numbers such as 2, 3, 4, –3, and –4 are solutions to the original problem. After addressing any other questions, have students work with another inequality, such as |3x| > 6, and ask them to raise the sticky notes where they could find the pizza parlor. After confirming that all students have raised the correct notes, endpoints included, have them rewrite the corresponding inequalities and solve each one. ",32,mtms2008-11-234a,,

"The concept of absolute value is a critical juncture in the mathematical journey of our students, as teachers strive to help them become mathematically proficient. To be clear, critical junctures are specific points in  the teaching and learning of mathematics where students have great difficulty understanding new and  fundamental concepts that impact their success with future mathematical concepts and ideas. At these critical junctures, teachers need to slow down to establish a firm foundation about such concepts and use multiple representations to tap into the full potential of students’ thinking. The strategy shared in this article points to one such venue, in addition to those shared by the referenced authors, that teachers can use to help their students better understand the concept of absolute value through realistic story problems that they can represent on a number line.",38,mtms2008-11-234a,,
"This strategy gives students an initial point of reference that they can use consistently with a given  concept. By making the students active participants in their learning through the use of their kinesthetic, spatial, and mathematical intelligences (Armstrong 2000) and having students explore multiple representations (NCTM 2000, p. 67), the activities discussed here lessen the mystery of a number line and the definition of absolute value so that students can use them effectively. Without question, a goal for mathematics teachers, when using any strategy to explore any given concept, is to have students reach a level of abstraction where they can solve such problems symbolically and understand the reasons why a strategy allows them to do so. The activity outlined in this article can be such a bridge for the teaching of absolute value in algebra classes, a bridge that can help teachers move students from the direct-modeling stage (Carpenter  et al. 1999) to that of understanding  a more symbolic and abstract  representation.
