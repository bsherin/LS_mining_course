5,Cartoon Corner: Play Ball!,"The odds of an event occurring  are the ratio of favorable outcomes  to unfavorable outcomes. The  probability of an event occurring is the ratio of favorable outcomes to the total possible outcomes. Therefore, if the odds are 1:3, the probability is 1/4. Odds can be converted to probabilities, and vice versa.  1.  Suppose you roll a 6-sided die once. Complete the table for  each type of roll.",5,Cartoon Corner: Play Ball!

The odds of 1:5 are equivalent to a probability of 1/6 (1:5 means 1 favorable outcome to 5 unfavorable outcomes, so there are 6 total outcomes). The odds of rolling an odd number are 3:3,  or 1:1 (3 favorable outcomes;  3 unfavorable outcomes). The odds of 1:1 are equivalent to a probability of 1/2.The odds of rolling a composite number are 2:4, or 1:2 (2 favorable outcomes; 4 unfavorable outcomes). The odds of 1:2 are equivalent to a probability of 1/3.",19,Cartoon Corner: Play Ball!

21,Cartoon Corner: Play Ball!,"  b.  A probability of 1/1,000 means that there is 1 favorable outcome  and 999 unfavorable outcomes. The odds of winning are 1:999.  3.  Lucy and Charlie Brown each stated  the odds of losing the game instead of the odds of winning the game; hence, they gave the odds backward. (The odds of winning at a millionto-one mean that there are a million ways of winning compared to just one way of losing.) The odds of winning should be “one to a million” and “one to a billion,” respectively. Another way to correct what they are saying is to simply change the word “win” to “lose.” 4.  a.  The odds of one-to-a-million are equivalent to a probability of 1/1,000,001. Odds of oneto-a-billion are equivalent to a probability of 1/1,000,000,001.",21,Cartoon Corner: Play Ball!
22,Cartoon Corner: Play Ball!,"  b.  Lucy thinks that the odds of  one-to-a-billion are better than the odds of one-to-a-million. However, odds of one-to-a-billion are about 1,000 times worse than odds of one-to-a-million.",22,Cartoon Corner: Play Ball!
23,Cartoon Corner: Play Ball!,"5.  a.  The odds of being drafted to the majors are the number of players who are drafted to the number of players who are not drafted, or 600:129,500.    b.  The probability is found by  dividing the number of athletes drafted to the major leagues by the total number of high school senior players: 600 ÷ 130,100 ≈ 0.0046, or about 0.5 percent.

24,Cartoon Corner: Play Ball!,"CHALLENGE 6.  a.  The outcomes for 4 games can  happen in 16 different ways:   AAAA, BAAA, ABAA, AABA, AAAB, BBAA, BABA, BAAB, ABBA, ABAB, AABB, BBBA, BBAB, BABB, ABBB, BBBB.   Team A wins all 4 games in only 1 of these 16 outcomes. The probability that team A will win the first four games is 1/16.  b.  Use a tree diagram to show that  the outcomes of 5 games can  occur in 32 possible ways. However, AAAAA, AAAAB, BBBBB, and BBBBA must be excluded because those series each end after only 4 games. There are 28 equally likely possible ways to show a series going exactly 5 games. In 8 of those outcomes, a team wins 4 games, including game 5. The probability that the series will end in exactly 5 games is 8/28, or 2/7.",24,Cartoon Corner: Play Ball!

26,Cartoon Corner: Play Ball!,"I introduced this lesson to a sixthgrade class. The students were excited about reading a cartoon in math class. We worked through most of the problems as a class or in small groups, and students completed the first few questions without much difficulty. The fact that Charlie Brown and Lucy confused the order in which to express the odds was excellent,  as many students did not initially understand what was wrong. The onein-a-million versus one-in-a-billion discussion was a good refresher on comparing fractions.",26,Cartoon Corner: Play Ball!

I read the cartoon to the students and then asked them to work in pairs, so that they would have someone to discuss procedures and ideas with. Desks are grouped in eights in my classroom, so each team could also get feedback from other teams. This activity sheet was an extension to what the students had ",30,Cartoon Corner: Play Ball!

36,Cartoon Corner: Play Ball!,"My two classes of sixth-grade  prealgebra students were familiar with probability and odds before investigating the cartoon. Probability and odds are concepts that many students feel like they have mastered, but misconceptions become evident when the theories are revisited. I could see the light bulb going on for some students when they recognized patterns for converting between probability and odds.",36,Cartoon Corner: Play Ball!
37,Cartoon Corner: Play Ball!,The challenge questions generated  the most conversation. The classes approached the problem with different strategies. The first class listed the teams and all possible outcomes. ,37,Cartoon Corner: Play Ball!

42,Cartoon Corner: Play Ball!,"Students could illustrate all 16 (24) ways and identify that only 1 possibility existed for team A to win in  4 games. They had more difficulty organizing their possibilities for part b.  We listed the possible outcomes on the board. As students worked, they estimated 32 possibilities (25) and then eliminated the 4 consecutive wins for A and B. Eventually they found 8/28, or 2/7. ",42,Cartoon Corner: Play Ball!
43,Cartoon Corner: Play Ball!,"The second class looked at the  probability of each game individually and realized that each game provided a 1/2 chance of winning for either team. They multiplied 1/2 × 1/2 × 1/2 × 1/2 = 1/16 for part a, and then 1/2 × 1/2 × 1/2 × 1/2 × 1/2 = 1/32 for part b. They stated that the probability was 8/32, or 1/4. With the prompt, “Would all 32 games end in exactly 5 games?” students realized that 4 outcomes would be eliminated and that the probability would be 8/28, or 2/7. ",43,Cartoon Corner: Play Ball!

47,Cartoon Corner: Play Ball!,"I used this Cartoon Corner with my fourth-grade and fifth-grade enrichment groups. Both grades had recently studied probability, but they had not had previous exposure to “odds” other than hearing it expressed in conversation (e.g., “The odds of winning are slim to none”). To prepare them for this activity, we made a concept map about probability so that I could assess their prior knowledge. I then gave a minilesson on odds, and we compared the two concepts.",47,Cartoon Corner: Play Ball!
48,Cartoon Corner: Play Ball!,"My enrichment groups each have eight students, and they worked on this activity for about forty minutes. They were encouraged to discuss the problems with their peers, resulting in a lot of great debate and justifying of answers. As expected, they especially struggled with odds and wanted to express all answers as probability. Most of them did understand the pattern of  adding the numbers in the odds to get the total number of possible outcomes and felt comfortable once they could relate this to the denominator in a probability expressed as a fraction. The students definitely enjoyed working on the problems and loved that they were familiar with the Peanuts characters.",48,Cartoon Corner: Play Ball!
