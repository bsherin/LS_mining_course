0,Promoting Mathematical Connections Using Three-Dimensional Manipulatives - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Principles to Actions: Ensuring Mathematical Success for All (NCTM 2014) gives teachers access to an insightful, research-informed framework that outlines ways to promote reasoning and sense making. Specifically, as students transition on their mathematical journey through middle school and beyond, their knowledge and use of representations should continually develop in complexity and scope. [Students] will need to be able to convert flexibly among these representations. Much of the power of mathematics comes from being able to view and operate on objects from different perspectives (NCTM 2000, p. 361). In fact, when students represent, discuss, and make connections among different mathematical ideas by using different methods, they engage in deeper sense making and improve their problem-solving skills while refining their mathematical understanding (Fuson, Kalchman, and Bransford 2005; Lesh, Post, and Behr 1987).",,
1,Promoting Mathematical Connections Using Three-Dimensional Manipulatives - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Recently, researchers have worked to connect lessons learned from their scholarship that can then be used by teachers in the classroom to empower students understanding of mathematics. Teachers are encouraged to devote time connecting algebra to arithmetic before transitioning to the structural ideas of algebra. They are also encouraged to promote experiences and interactions with physical objects and manipulatives to set the foundation for future abstraction (Kieran 1992). The primary goal of this article is to promote connections in the teaching and learning of algebraic thinking as recommended by current mathematics standards and to illustrate the coherence of mathematics by linking algebraic and geometric representations (Garofalo and Trinter 2012).",,

3,Promoting Mathematical Connections Using Three-Dimensional Manipulatives - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Many middle school students have experience using manipulatives to make sense of mathematics. Driscoll (1999) explained that fluency in linking and translating among multiple representations seems to be critical in the development of algebraic thinking (p. 141). Early student experiences interacting with physical objects and manipulatives provide a golden opportunity as well as a mathematical basis for future mathematics (Skemp 1987). By leveraging such experiences in reasoning with algebra and geometry in two-dimensional settings, students can continue to make sense of different representations. Teachers can use these two-dimensional manipulatives to emphasize connections between algebraic instancessuch as multiplying polynomialswith the geometric representation related to the area accounted for through the product of algebraic expressions.",,

The following tasks represent instances that can inform teachers practices as students explore algebraic expressions through the use of two-dimensional and three-dimensional manipulatives. These research-based efforts illustrate instances that are consistent with NCTMs Principles and Standards for School Mathematics in that different representations support different ways of thinking about and manipulating mathematical objects (2000, p. 361).",,
