1,Readers Write  August 2013,MATHEMATICS AND AVIATION,1,Readers Write  August 2013
2,Readers Write  August 2013,"As a pilot married to a wonderful seventh-grade math teacher, I noticed the March 2013 journal (“Change Math Attitudes with Aviation”) and promptly picked it up to read the cover story. I think it is great that aviation was used as a platform to teach math, for all the reasons that were mentioned in the article.",2,Readers Write  August 2013
3,Readers Write  August 2013,"This article demonstrated a way  to measure the altitude over time in a climb. Teachers can also have students verify their initial calculation by ﬁ guring out how many feet per minute the plane has to climb to get from one altitude to another. Students can recheck that calculation by using the instrument just below the altimeter, the vertical speed indicator (VSI), which measures how many feet per minute the plane is either climbing or descending. If the plane is at level ﬂ ight, the needle will point to 0 at the nine o’clock position; if climbing, the needle will rise (each mark is 100 feet per minute); if descending, the needle will fall. A teacher can ask students to hold a constant value in the VSI that matches what they calculated, then he or she can time them and see if they are at their new altitude.",3,Readers Write  August 2013
4,Readers Write  August 2013,There are all sorts of aviation links to mathematics. How much fuel is in the plane and how much is burned per hour coupled with a cruising speed will give students ways of calculating range without running out of fuel—an obvious no-no in aviation. The use of charts in navigation is another  example of the mathematics that is in use. The list is endless. ,4,Readers Write  August 2013

7,Readers Write  August 2013,Thanks for exciting students about  aviation. I hope they catch the bug that I have had all my life!,7,Readers Write  August 2013
