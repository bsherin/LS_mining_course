"During a football game, the home team decides to kick a field goal from the left side of the field at the 8-yard line. The commentator suggests that the team take a 5-yard penalty (move 5 yards back) for a better kicking angle. (See the definition below.) Should the team follow the commentator’s suggestion? ",4,mtms2012-08-64a,,
"The kicking angle is formed by  drawing two rays, one from the ball to each goalpost. In the diagram at right, point A represents the ball on the left sideline; also shown is the kicking angle from point A. The kicker will have a better chance of making the field goal if the kicking angle is larger.",5,mtms2012-08-64a,,
"ProbleMs The points in the diagram represent ball placement either along the sideline or at the center of the field. Although kickers do not generally kick from the sideline, imagine that they do for this activity.",6,mtms2012-08-64a,,
1. a. Point A is on the 8-yard line; point B is on the 13-yard line. Use the angles in table 1 to determine which kicking angle is larger. Is the commentator correct?,7,mtms2012-08-64a,,

"Kicking point angle measure 17.26° 14.18° 11.94° 10.29° 19.54° 15.35° b. If point C is on the 18-yard line, and point D is on the 23-yard line, use table 1 to determine which location provides a larger kicking angle. Is taking a 5-yard penalty from the 18-yard line (and kicking from the 23-yard line) a good idea?  c. In which scenario, part (a) or (b), is the difference smaller? What does it mean in terms of the context of the problem for the difference to be smaller?  d. Where could you place the ball so that taking a 5-yard penalty would increase the kicking angle (i.e., support the commentator’s advice)? 2. In the diagram, point E is on the 8-yard line, and point F is on the 13-yard line, both in the center of the field.  a. Use the table to determine whether at a given distance (e.g., the 8-yard line) the best kicking angle is from the center of the field or the right sideline. What angles did you compare? b. What is the angle difference between kicking from point A and from point E? What is the angle difference between kicking from point B and from point F? Which difference is smaller?  c. In terms of the context, what does it mean in part (b) for one of the differences to be smaller?",9,mtms2012-08-64a,,
