Posing Fermi questions to students allows them to use their  innate number sense and encourages mental calculation.,2,mtms2008-12-280a,,
"tThe longer I teach eighth grade, the  more confident I am in making the statement that many students are not only ready for algebra, they are relieved to learn it. A student once wrote, “Algebra is almost meditative once you learn how to solve for x or graph a line.” It seemed an odd statement until I considered his history with mathematics. As his seventhgrade teacher, I saw him struggle with scientific notation, ratios, and geometric proportionality. Regardless of the problem-solving nature of our mathematics curriculum, he often seemed frustrated by the mystery of how numbers related to each other.   I have noticed that some students  who struggle with seventh-grade mathematics go on to be quite successful in eighth-grade algebra. Perhaps they pass into a new developmental stage. Maybe eighth grade carries a ",3,mtms2008-12-280a,,
Glenn C. Kenyon significant weight in our students’ minds as they look forward to what high school has to offer. Perhaps some students have not come to easy terms with the numbers they have been manipulating since they started school. Moving from an abstract manipulation to seeing how these numbers fit in real life is a leap for many students. ,4,mtms2008-12-280a,,
"For years, students have been asked  to build the number 1,000,000 from rainbow cubes and paper, measure scaled versions of our solar system on the playground, and study images of powers of 10 from the microscopic quark to the universe. They have also learned the rules of exponents, calculated the distance from Mars to Jupiter, and determined what each of us owes as a portion of the national debt. In all cases, students would read the problem, and I would guide them toward a solution. As creative as these activities  may have been, some students dutifully followed the task without grasping the numbers and their implications.",5,mtms2008-12-280a,,
"Without a doubt, the middle school  mathematics curriculum needs to prepare students to deal with quantitative situations in their lives outside school. The NCTM’s Principles and Standards for School Mathematics states that students need to “develop an understanding of large numbers and recognize and appropriately use exponential, scientific, and calculator notation” (2000, p. 214). They need to “determine which data are appropriate for their needs, understand how the data were gathered, and consider limitations that could affect interpretation” (NCTM 2000, p. 249). How do we best address this goal?",6,mtms2008-12-280a,,
"Number sense has been relegated to  the back seat in eighth grade because of the focus placed on algebra. In addition, graphing calculators are being used in class. As a result of these two realities, students who once knew their multiplication tables are now using their calculators to multiply 7 by 8 and lose numerical fluency.",7,mtms2008-12-280a,,
"glenn c. Kenyon, gkenyon@sfschool.org, teaches seventh-grade and eighth-grade mathematics at the San Francisco School in California. He has a National Board Credential in General Education, Upper Elementary. He is fascinated with not only the history of mathematical discovery and development but how it enriches students’ mathematical knowledge.  using FerMi Questions",8,mtms2008-12-280a,,
"One way that I have returned the focus to number sense in my classes has been to use Fermi questions. Also known as back-of-the-envelope calculations, Fermi questions are problems posed with limited information. The goal is to derive an approximate answer based on a series of assumptions, questions, and estimations. Fermi questions are in honor of Enrico Fermi, an Italian physicist known for his work on the Los Alamos atomic bomb project during World War II. It is said that he accurately estimated the power of the atomic bomb detonation based on what he observed as he let his handkerchief drop when the pressure wave passed over him. ",9,mtms2008-12-280a,,
"Fermi questions promote nontraditional problem-solving strategies. Students must use estimation, apply number sense, and question and communicate with one another. All these areas involve mathematical skills. Fermi questions encourage multiple approaches and emphasize the process rather than the answer. ",10,mtms2008-12-280a,,
"I was intrigued with how my students would react to a Fermi question. After giving a brief background of Enrico Fermi’s life, they were presented with this question:",11,mtms2008-12-280a,,
How many piano tuners are in San Francisco?,12,mtms2008-12-280a,,
The students looked perplexed. ,13,mtms2008-12-280a,,
"What numbers were they expected to work with? They were told that we had no specific numbers other than those we might know of as a group, such as the population of San Francisco (approximately 800,000). One student raised her hand. “I actually know that there are about fifteen piano tuners in San Francisco because we have a piano,  and we looked for a tuner once.” Another student said that he did not believe that number was valid because people from other cities advertise in San Francisco’s telephone book. It had not occurred to me to  research the actual number before the activity, but I suggested that we try as a group to work out a reasonable es- timate. The unexpected debate about the validity of a number resulted in an animated discussion. I entered the class with little more than a question, a personal comfort level with large numbers, and a fascination for the historical context of mathematical discoveries and inventions. Although having no concrete numbers, specific lesson plan structures or worksheets, or an understanding of a piano tuner’s work, my lack of knowledge in this one instance was advantageous. Normally, this would be considered poor teaching practice, potentially causing chaos and terrible learning outcomes. However, with minimal knowledge of a reasonable answer, it was truly up to the students to find a result. Students were engaged and thoughtful and some were surprisingly knowledgeable about piano tuners.",14,mtms2008-12-280a,,
"While encouraging the ensuing conversation, I found myself categorizing the class’s assumptions into two groups: what we knew as near fact and what were our best-guess assumptions. These two later evolved into  the Fact and Assumption categories. There were quantitative facts (the population of San Francisco) and assumptions (one student’s assertion that it takes two days to tune a large piano). There were also qualitative facts and assumptions. For example, we were pretty sure that not every owner of a piano would actually hire a piano tuner in a given year. Another qualitative assumption is that homeowners were more likely to own a piano than renters. We tried to use these qualitative assumptions to guide our quantitative work but encountered a wide range of opinions and much debate. For example, rounding 18,000 to 20,000 was a point of discussion.    Since the goal was to arrive at a number by the end of the fifty-minute period, several decisions had to be made to impose my understanding  on the problem and avoid the timeconsuming practice of debating too many fine points along the way.",15,mtms2008-12-280a,,
"By the end of that period, the class  had estimated that there were approximately 100 piano tuners in San Francisco. The number seemed quite large, given all our assumptions, so we spent about five minutes looking over our calculations. Fermi problems often deal with very large numbers, and choices about magnitude play important roles in the procedure. After looking over our numbers, we felt that we had overestimated by a factor of ten the number of households that were capable of having pianos. Decreasing it tenfold brought our number of piano tuners down to ten, thereby essentially agreeing with the girl who started the debate in the first place and the boy who was sure her answer was too high. The fact is that given what we knew, the two answers were very close to each other.",16,mtms2008-12-280a,,
"After class ended, I thought about the importance of what had just hap- pened. My students were highly engaged in solving a problem. They had several opinions about the size and validity of our estimates, which meant to me that they were grappling with the real meaning of using numbers in context. Our mathematics class felt more like a humanities or science class, infused with debates, hypotheses, and consensus-driven decision making. Although I wanted to bring similar problems to class, how often, with little preparation, could such positive learning outcomes occur?",17,mtms2008-12-280a,,
"To reinforce the experience from the piano-tuner discussion, another question was posed to the class the following week.",18,mtms2008-12-280a,,
"If we could weigh the entire student body on a given day, what would be the result in pounds? ",19,mtms2008-12-280a,,
"I invited our school administrator to observe the class. During this problem-solving session, students were placed in groups of four to work through the problem, since I did not want to lead the conversation. This question seemed to interest students, because they immediately started working. Each group was given a large piece of paper and a marker. They were asked to list all their facts and assumptions in a T table and show all calculations. They wanted to use calculators, but since technology would defeat one purpose of this exercise, I insisted that they round their numerical assumptions and make them friendlier to paper-and-pencil work.",20,mtms2008-12-280a,,
"The two adults in the room wandered from group to group, alternately observing and offering advice when requested. The problem had an easy entry point, namely, the number of students in their own eighth-grade class and the approximate weight of a normal eighth  grader. Nearly all groups began work from these natural entry points and moved through the grades. The assumptions of average weight that these groups found independently were fascinating. Students demonstrated a clear concept of what average looks like in the real world. That said, some of these same students would be challenged to calculate averages accurately if a group of numbers was given to them. Nearly all the groups assumed about a ten-pound weight difference from grade to grade, which, when applied all the way down to the three-year-olds in our preschool, worked out to about forty pounds. (This number actually coincided with my own son’s weight at that age.) They also rounded the number of students in each class to thirty in the middle school and twenty in the elementary and preschools. Although these numbers undercut the entire school by about 10 percent, students were able to make the calculations relatively quickly and effortlessly.",21,mtms2008-12-280a,,
"With little guidance or modeling aside from the piano-tuner problem the previous week, the eighth graders were able to work out the intricacies of this problem with little controversy. Seven groups of students worked on the problem for about forty minutes. When each group was called to give an answer, I was shocked to see the degree of agreement. The answers were between 17,000 and 20,000 pounds. (See fig. 1 and the student work describing their calculations.) The students were surprised to see that these answers were remarkably uniform, given the nature of the problem. To them, the answers were dissimilar until I explained that in this type of problem where assumptions are crucial, coming within 10 percent of one another was amazing. They shared their posters and concluded ",22,mtms2008-12-280a,,
"Fig. 1 Students’ calculations about total pounds within the school that although their assumptions varied from group to group, their answers were relatively close together.",23,mtms2008-12-280a,,
"Contemplating the next step, I was excited about the outcomes of the two lessons dedicated to Fermi questions. Some good organizational strategies evolved from using the fact and assumption tables. Pedagogically, moving students away from calculators would help them recover some latent number sense that was being supplanted by technology. These outcomes were directly supporting the NCTM’s Standard of developing number sense in a realworld context. ",24,mtms2008-12-280a,,
"I found myself influenced by the  activity to the point of looking at the school, the city, and beyond as sources of intriguing Fermi questions. These are some of the Fermi questions that I have used with eighth graders as a result of analyzing the environment: 1.  How many dog groomers are in  our city? 2.  How much paper do we use at our  school in one month? 3.  How many hours of recess have  you had since kindergarten? How does that number compare with the hours of instruction? 4.  How long would it take to count to  one million?",25,mtms2008-12-280a,,
"After drawing up a list and starting to plan a yearlong unit, I wondered if this was a way to solve my students’ number sense woes or would it kill the magic of these last two lessons if the format was institutionalized? The answer lies somewhere in between these two extremes. The process mirrors much found in teaching; it requires a delicate balance between art and science. No bullet-proof lesson will ensure student success, and even the best lesson can be a disaster if delivered poorly. If Fermi questions were assigned on a weekly basis, the novelty would wear off. It would be difficult to continually find questions that motivate students. In answer, a few weeks later I asked another question: ",26,mtms2008-12-280a,,
How much turkey is consumed in the United States on Thanksgiving? ,27,mtms2008-12-280a,,
"Again, the students dove into the problem, but the spirit and innovation were noticeably absent in the class that day. The luster was gone, and all had returned to routine. Routine is preferable for many aspects of class but not when using Fermi questions. I will continue to view the world as being a source of Fermi questions. When the moment is right, I will share one such question with the class. ",28,mtms2008-12-280a,,
