"To promote math and science,  a researcher designed an activity to show students  that biomedical ﬁ elds are within their reach. ",6,mtms2010-11-240a,,
"I was surprised to learn of the educational problems with high dropout rates and the lack of focus on the importance of science in K−12 when I moved to Kentucky. For instance, the state ranks 47th in the number of scientists, 45th in the number of patents issued, and 42nd in the number of high-tech jobs. In addition, only 4.75 per 1000 bachelor’s degrees are awarded in science and engineering (Secretary Helen Mountjoy 2008 presentation to the Kentucky Education Cabinet). I believe that Kentucky scientists, university professors, and K−12 teachers have a tremendous  responsibility in working to turn these statistics around and strengthen the scientiﬁ c educational base of the state.",7,mtms2010-11-240a,,

"My interests lie in reaching, engaging, and encouraging grade-school students in underserved, rural, and inner-city areas of the state who do not have the opportunities to interact with engineers and who are not adequately encouraged to realize their potential in related academic pursuits. Given this interest, I developed the BEBUCK program (Biomedical ",9,mtms2010-11-240a,,
Engineering Brought to Underserved Children in Kentucky) to engage students in hands-on activities in biomedical engineering (see the sidebar on p. 242).,10,mtms2010-11-240a,,

"My research background is in mechanical testing of biologically related devices and tissues, such as implants, sutures, and bone. As such, I developed a small-scale testing machine that is used to load specimens and record the failure behavior (load and displacement) of the object. To give K−12 students exposure to  the BeBUcK ",12,mtms2010-11-240a,,
Program ,13,mtms2010-11-240a,,
"I developed the BEBUCK (Biomedical Engineering Brought to Underserved Children in Kentucky) program to address the special needs of Kentucky, namely, to strengthen the K−12 scientifi c educational base of the state. ",14,mtms2010-11-240a,,
"I chose to focus this program on students in a county that does not have a four-year college or university. As such, if educators do not take the initiative to focus activities on these students, they will not be exposed to specialized engineering fi elds such as biomedical engineering. Moreover, I believe a major strength in this type of faculty-driven activity is to give them a chance to interact with professional engineers, receive encouragement, and spend one-on-one time with adults who are truly excited and actively engaged in applying math and science in their daily jobs. ",15,mtms2010-11-240a,,
I tried to make it very clear to students that a job such as mine was well  within their abilities if they work hard in their math and science classes. ,16,mtms2010-11-240a,,
"In the program’s initial launch in 2008 in Pulaski County, Kentucky, the fi eld of biomedical engineering was introduced to approximately 125 fi fthgrade students. Given the diffi culty in coordinating a fi eld trip of this scale and potential liability issues, I took the program on the road to interact with the students. The program was aimed at fi fth graders because I wanted to cultivate that excitement for learning that is still prevalent at this age and excite them about math and science through hands-on learning.",17,mtms2010-11-240a,,
"The students were divided into ten classrooms of approximately 12−15  students per group. Within each classroom, the students were further divided into the two groups for testing the intact and knotted suture. These smaller groups ensured that each student had a chance to use the wrench and physically help to secure the suture in the testing fi xture. Volunteers were also selected to run the test (start the motor). From their excitement at watching the suture test and trying to predict where the suture would break, it was clear that this was a fun experience for the students. Many students who described themselves as being all thumbs were thrilled to learn that there are careers in which engineers get paid to break things for a living.",18,mtms2010-11-240a,,
"One of the major compromises of my program to reach the largest  number of students involved minimizing the amount of time for the activity. In the initial implementation of the BEBUCK program, each classroom was given forty-fi ve minutes. This time was rather rushed, but it was a necessary compromise to minimize my absence from my faculty position and the two-hundred-mile round-trip distance from the university. ",19,mtms2010-11-240a,,
"The distance issue will be a serious concern in trying to grow a program  of this nature, because few faculty will be able to set aside this type of travel time, given their other activities and professional commitments. However, I believe these kinds of activities are crucial if we want to reach these students. In an effort to reach more students, I will be making videos of the testing,  and testing curves and handouts (with solutions) will be available if K−12 teachers would like to use these activities in their classroom.  this ﬁ eld, I designed an activity in which students used this machine to put weight, or stress, on a suture and determine the breaking strength. The activity had three distinct goals:  1.  To introduce the ﬁ eld of biomedical engineering to students and encourage them in these career pursuits  2.  To give them hands-on experience  conducting a biomechanical test 3.  To use math and science to analyze  data and answer a real-world question: Does knotting a suture (the ﬁ ber used to stitch an incision closed) strengthen or weaken it? ",20,mtms2010-11-240a,,
This article will focus on how this activity was implemented at the ﬁ fthgrade level.,21,mtms2010-11-240a,,
"To make the activity accessible  and practical to students, I began by explaining to them that biomedical engineers use math and science to understand and address problems related to the human body, speciﬁ cally, to understand how the body functions as a machine and to make implants and sutures that function properly in the body. ",22,mtms2010-11-240a,,
"To make the activity more practi- cal, I brought in a variety of bone implants and discussed real-world situations that the students may have already heard about or experienced. For example, I asked them how many had grandparents who had an artiﬁ cial hip or knee. I also asked if anyone in the room had needed stitches. Those who had stitches took great pride in telling the class about the antics that led to this necessity for them. I then asked them to describe to the other students how the sutures looked. I speciﬁ cally wanted them to talk about a suture not being a continuous strand of thread but a series of individual knots tied across the incision. This discussion segued into the current activity, which determined if knotting the suture strengthens or weakens it. ",23,mtms2010-11-240a,,

Split into two groups, and conduct studies to determine the  mechanical strength of their suture before and after knotting.

Did knotting the suture make it weaker (easier to break)? Explain your answer. ,43,mtms2010-11-240a,,
"To accompany the activity, I  created a handout for the students. It introduced sutures and pointed out some of the different materials (silk, nylon) and styles (single strand, braided) of suture available (see ﬁ g. 1). ",44,mtms2010-11-240a,,
"The students split into two groups of test engineers. Group 1 was given intact, braided suture; group 2 was given the same suture with a knot in the center (a double or triple tying knot enhances the result). After show-",45,mtms2010-11-240a,,

"Fig. 3 This typical load-displacement curve from a suture test can be mirrored in many other activities that test material versus load strength.  ing students how to put the sutures in the ﬁ xtures and run the machine, it was explained to them that as the machine runs and stretches the suture, two electronic devices on the machine keep track of how much the suture stretches and the load (weight) that is required to cause that stretch (see ﬁ g. 2). The students were then given the chance to test their strands of suture. Alternating between groups 1 and 2 running the tests kept their interest and ensured that we worked through the analysis as one group. As they tested the suture, they were also told to note where it broke (in the center or at the ﬁ xture). ",47,mtms2010-11-240a,,
"The students then returned to their  seats and were given two data curves (per group) from the suture testing. They were shown how to ﬁ ll out the tables on the handout and worked in their groups to accomplish this task. I drew a typical test curve (see ﬁ g. 3) on the board, and walked students through the process of how to determine the failure load, failure stretch, and calculate the stiffness of their samples. (The stiffness is a measure of the ﬂ exibility of the material.) This activity reinforced their ability to read points from a graph. In addition, they were shown how to calculate the slope of a curve to determine the stiffness. It is important that sutures be able to ﬂ ex while in use. Throughout the activity, it was reinforced that these are the exact calculations that test engineers use to evaluate the behavior of an object. ",48,mtms2010-11-240a,,
"Once the groups had completed  their tables, students got together with someone from the other group and shared their answers. In this way, each student had the data from both the intact and knotted suture and could answer this question: Does knotting the suture strengthen or weaken it? After comparing the data, they learned that knotting weakened the suture, as shown in the graph in ﬁ gure 4. ",49,mtms2010-11-240a,,
Fig. 4 Knotted suture was not as strong as an intact suture.,50,mtms2010-11-240a,,
"In addition, the students were  given the opportunity to look at the suture through a microscope. The suture used for the activity was braided. The braiding was not easily visible to the naked eye but was easily seen through the microscope.  sUtURe actiVitY FoR a high school classRooM",51,mtms2010-11-240a,,
"Although these types of activities ﬁ t well within the theme of biomedical engineering, teachers interested in similar experiences can complete comparable activities. For instance, the suture project could easily be modiﬁ ed to determine the breaking strength of yarn or twine. To do so, tie a cup, or small bucket, on one end of the material. Using marbles or metal pellets or washers as weights, students could add weights until the yarn breaks. By weighing one weight and counting the number it takes to break the yarn, students could determine the breaking strength of the yarn. These types of activities not only strengthen mathematical skills but also promote teamwork, problem solving, and design. ",52,mtms2010-11-240a,,
"The complexity of the activity can expand with the age level and mathematical ability of the students. For example, the same suture activity could be implemented in the high school classroom. I developed a handout of this activity appropriate for high school students (not shown, but available on request). Although the testing and explanation are the same, less direction is given with the mathematics. It is expected that students will know how to calculate a slope (stiffness) and determine a percent change. ",53,mtms2010-11-240a,,
"When sufﬁ cient time has been devoted to this project (at least two hours), I have used four different suture grades that vary based on size and strength. Students have not been told which of the sutures they have, but based on their mechanical data and that of the other students, they have had to determine suture grade. If time allows for follow-up discussion, the concept and advantage of conducting blind (unbiased) testing can be discussed. ",54,mtms2010-11-240a,,
Similar experiments could be  run with anything from embroidery thread and dental ﬂ oss to ﬁ shing line. ,55,mtms2010-11-240a,,
"Using this process, students could also pursue a project of their own interest and design their own weighting system. For example, we have tested hair strands before and after two weeks’ use of a protein shampoo to determine if the manufacturer’s claim of increased strength was true. ",56,mtms2010-11-240a,,
"In addition, the mechanics of the  machine, which consists of a linear slide driven by a servo motor, may be explained in more detail to high school students and incorporated into science lessons on motion. (See Saunders and Donahue 2004 for an article on the development of the loading machine that is appropriate for a senior high school physics class.) Finally, if these types of testing activities are of interest, commercial testing devices (high-tech toys) are available for educational purposes. One such company that offers a testing device is Pasco (www.pasco.com).  collaBoRations",57,mtms2010-11-240a,,
I would like to encourage teachers interested in these types of activities to contact their local colleges and universities. A great place to start is to research the college or university on the Internet and see if it has an outreach program. Many institutions of higher learning have many opportunities for K−12 students to participate in outreach activities. ,58,mtms2010-11-240a,,
"Although K−12 teachers may be hesitant to contact their local college or university, they should realize that participation in these opportunities is beneﬁ cial to the university. For example, the National Science Foundation (NSF) offers prestigious and lucrative grants to college faculty engaged in both research and educational activities. Although not all researchers will choose these types of activities to develop and promote, many are interested in K−12 outreach. Junior faculty may be particularly receptive to developing collaborative  students view suture microscopically to see what their tables are telling them about load and breaking points.   outreach activities with K–12 teachers because NSF Career awards aimed at pretenured faculty require an outreach component. These activities are not limited to K−12 students but may also involve the teachers in these activities. Numerous opportunities are available for educational outreach, and researchers have a great deal of freedom when developing creative programs to meet the unique needs of their community. ",59,mtms2010-11-240a,,
"Another important resource is  the student chapters of professional societies. For instance, biomedical engineering has the Biomedical Engineering Society (BMES), and mechanical engineering has the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME). Campuses that offer degrees in these areas will have a student chapter of the professional society. These societies are encouraged to serve as ambassadors to their ﬁ eld and focus on outreach and volunteer work and may be very receptive to working with K−12 schools to participate in ongoing activities such as serving as science fair judges. However, since college students may not have transportation of their own, this might limit the working distance for such collaborations. ",60,mtms2010-11-240a,,
"In addition to the campus sup- port, the BMES Web site has additional information to explain to K−12 students what a biomedical engineer is and may be a helpful resource for teachers in planning these types of activities or introducing the ﬁ eld to their classrooms. (See bmes.seas.wustl.edu/ careers.asp.)",61,mtms2010-11-240a,,
Young mathematicians learn about the machinery of health and science.  ,62,mtms2010-11-240a,,
"In closing, I highly encourage  teachers to approach a local university.",63,mtms2010-11-240a,,
"Not being a native Kentuckian, I was unfamiliar with the school system. I was made aware of opportunities because Pulaski County educators had approached the University of Kentucky. Furthermore, given that schools are required to meet state learning guidelines, not all K−12 schools may feel these types of activities are appropriate or meet their immediate needs. The university faculty looking for outreach in school systems will quickly give up this type of outreach endeavor if these activities are not pursued. Therefore, I believe that if K−12 teachers want to incorporate these types of activities into their classroom and university faculty want to devote their service time, both parties need to actively seek out each other.
