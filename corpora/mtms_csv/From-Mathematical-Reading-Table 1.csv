4,From Mathematical Reading to Mathematical Literacy,"This account of my growing interest in mathematical literacy specifi cally involves mathematical reading. This shift in interest began with a six-week observational study in an eighth-grade classroom in a suburban, Midwestern school district. During this period, I witnessed both a seasoned classroom teacher and a preservice teacher lead many lessons from the Connected Mathematics Project, Version 3 (CMP 3) curriculum. A particularly salient episode came from a lesson about a taco truck in which one of the students produced a novel interpretation and solution, one that differed from most others in the room. The episode, chronicled below, led to an exploration of the 2017 NCTM conference and various forms of literature in search of an explanation of how reading is used in mathematics classrooms.

7,From Mathematical Reading to Mathematical Literacy,"Emily Dickinson once wrote, and others (e.g., Woody Allen, Selena Gomez) have paraphrased, that “the heart wants what it wants—or else it does not care” (Dickinson and Todd 1894, p. 204). Similarly, we as educators can say that “the book wants what it wants.” In one eighth-grade classroom, our focal student, Ricardo (a pseudonym), and his classmates investigated a pair of taco truck orders found in the eighth-grade CMP 3 book It’s in the System (Lappan et al. 2014). This problem shared details of two student lunch orders from a taco food truck. The fi rst order, six tacos and two drinks, totaled $9.00. The second student paid $7.00 for four tacos and two drinks. The text provides a model depicting the two orders with sketches of half-circles ",7,From Mathematical Reading to Mathematical Literacy

",10,From Mathematical Reading to Mathematical Literacy
11,From Mathematical Reading to Mathematical Literacy,"On the basis of previous investigations within the CMP 3 book, students were to use the addition method to solve this system of linear equations. ",11,From Mathematical Reading to Mathematical Literacy
12,From Mathematical Reading to Mathematical Literacy,"Many of the students successfully used the addition method, crossing out 4 tacos, 2 drinks, and $7.00 from each order (see ﬁ g. 2). This solution left 2 tacos and $2.00 in the fi rst model, implying that each taco costs $1.00. From this point, many students crossed off 4 tacos and $4.00 from the second model,  leaving 2 drinks and $3.00.With 2 drinks and $3.00, students established that each drink costs $1.50. This solution—a taco for $1.00 and a drink for $1.50—matched the book’s answers, and the book wants what it wants, or else it does not care.",12,From Mathematical Reading to Mathematical Literacy
13,From Mathematical Reading to Mathematical Literacy,"Ricardo had a different solution. On this day, Ricardo was engaged in a manner not observed during previous lessons. His hand went up, he was called on, and he strode to the board. Ricardo told the class how confi dent he was that he knew what was going on. “There’s a deal, see,” Ricardo explained. In this deal, he suggested, a free drink comes with a purchase of 3 tacos. He grouped the tacos and drinks as shown in ﬁ gure 3. “Each taco is $1.50,” he stated, “because 6 times $1.50 is $9.” For the fi rst model, Ricardo’s logic held as true. ",13,From Mathematical Reading to Mathematical Literacy
14,From Mathematical Reading to Mathematical Literacy,"The instructor asked him about the  second model.  “What?” Ricardo asked. The instructor rephrased, “You say  that each taco is $1.50, right? Does this solution work on the second model?” ",14,From Mathematical Reading to Mathematical Literacy
15,From Mathematical Reading to Mathematical Literacy,"At this point, Ricardo appeared  confused and ﬂ ustered. He stated that he had not seen the second model, and he returned to his seat. Because Ricardo yielded the ﬂ oor, his solution was never tested on the second model. His reasoning did not fi t what the book wanted, so the instructor and class moved on. If one took a moment to explore this second model, however, one would establish that Ricardo’s solution did, indeed, hold true. Figure 4 shows a grouping of 3 tacos and a drink, for $4.50. This leaves 1 taco—a $1.50 value—and 1 drink. If the $4.50 for the 3-taco deal is added to the $1.50 for the single taco, a sum of $6.00 is found. The drink is that fi nal dollar. If the taco truck did indeed have a “buy 3 tacos, get a drink for free” meal deal, Ricardo found a sound solution to the exercise. He established that each taco is $1.50, and a full-priced drink is $1.00. ",15,From Mathematical Reading to Mathematical Literacy
16,From Mathematical Reading to Mathematical Literacy,It is reasonable to question whether ,16,From Mathematical Reading to Mathematical Literacy
17,From Mathematical Reading to Mathematical Literacy,"Ricardo’s proposed solution was an example of student resistance, in which he aimed to provide some diffi cultly for the instructor, or a product of out-of-the-box thinking. We must acknowledge that student resistance— behavior that hampers classroom activities, student efforts to withdraw from learning, and/or student choice to be noncompliant—are often found within middle school classrooms (Toshalis 2015). Furthermore, Ricardo, over the six-week study, demonstrated an aptitude for resisting instruction. I observed sessions where he sat silently with his head down and other class periods where he sought to be the center of attention, derailing instruction through joking and talking with fellow classmates. Throughout the study, the level of excitement and engagement observed in Ricardo was unique for this lesson. Ricardo was a student prone to disruption, and on this day, for this lesson, he was excited and engaged. ",17,From Mathematical Reading to Mathematical Literacy
18,From Mathematical Reading to Mathematical Literacy,"Did this new level of engagement allow Ricardo to capitalize on his out-ofthe-box thought process? Certainly, yes. It is my conjecture that Ricardo read the problem differently than the textbook writer intended, and differently than the way in which the teacher and fellow classmates understood the problem. His alternate reading led to a different understanding of what was being asked, and thus he obtained a solution that fell outside the intended box. ",18,From Mathematical Reading to Mathematical Literacy
19,From Mathematical Reading to Mathematical Literacy,"Ricardo’s solution was “offi cially”  incorrect, yet it satisfi ed the model used in this lesson. Does it make sense to give the book the fi nal word? If so, how do we inform our students that the book wants what it wants, and provide them the skills needed to decipher the book’s desires? Furthermore, when we teach mathematical literacy, are we looking to improve student solutions to realistic classroom problems, or prepare students for actual, real-life problems that they may encounter?

22,From Mathematical Reading to Mathematical Literacy,"Through my NCTM conference attendance, I aimed to explore my wonderings related to mathematical reading. I roamed the convention center in search of conference sessions focused on mathematical literacy, hoping to fi nd more information about how reading is being taught, or should be taught, in math class. I drifted among grade bands, practitioner and researcher presentations, and varied mathematical content whenever possible. ",22,From Mathematical Reading to Mathematical Literacy
23,From Mathematical Reading to Mathematical Literacy,"Using the 2017 NCTM conference app, I searched for the keywords literature and reading. A total of 14 (of approximately 700) sessions were found through this search, suggesting that approximately 2 percent of all conference sessions were explicitly exploring reading in a mathematics classroom. On the basis of how other sessions fi t into my schedule, I attended two. At the risk of oversimplifying the two very informative sessions, I learned how one can, and should, choose culturally responsive stories when selecting books for classroom use, and that children’s literature books have been successfully used to explore mathematical ideas in early elementary school.

They also explored the ways these students used models to communicate and justify mathematical ideas, complete with pictures of the models created by the kindergarten students in the study.

27,From Mathematical Reading to Mathematical Literacy,"Each session presented a new mix of participants, and the conversations held with other attendees regarding reading in mathematics—whether before or after sessions—helped fi ne-tune my questions but provided few concrete answers. Quite possibly the most productive of these times was the twenty minutes prior to Melissa Crowley’s presentation about schools being  hard to address both the written and discursive components of mathematical literacy, but we have not placed a similar focus on mathematical reading. ",27,From Mathematical Reading to Mathematical Literacy
28,From Mathematical Reading to Mathematical Literacy,"The issue encountered by our  student, Ricardo, further emphasizes a need to consider mathematical reading instruction within our classes. He was asked to make sense of a text that presented words, symbols, and information represented as a diagram, all components of mathematical reading (Adams 2003; Hillman 2014). In doing so, our student provided a real-life answer—one that matched his lived experience—to the book’s realistic task. Conversely, his instructor has experience reading the mathematics book and understanding the wants of the book. The reading strategies employed by experienced readers of mathematics are often different than those by novice readers (Shepherd and van de Sande 2014; Adams and Lowery 2007), and this difference in reading ability and experience may very well explain how our student and his instructor understood the taco truck problem so differently.

31,From Mathematical Reading to Mathematical Literacy,"United States seems to have been approached in two ways: through mathematical writing and mathematical discourse. The reading skills needed to “interpret mathematics” take a secondary position to the need to write and talk like a mathematician. Our counterparts in the National Council of Teachers of English (NCTE) see literacy as multimodal, an “interplay of meaningmaking systems (alphabetic, oral, visual, etc.) that teachers and students should strive to study and produce” (NCTE 2005). Furthermore, NCTE (1999) suggests that students need opportunities to explore modes of literacy—reading, writing, speaking, and listening— and to see how these literacies work in concert to support one another.",31,From Mathematical Reading to Mathematical Literacy
32,From Mathematical Reading to Mathematical Literacy,"As teachers of mathematics, we seek  to build our students’ mathematical literacy. However, we must remember that reading is important for success in mathematics (Doerr and Temple 2016). Students are often given textbooks and exams that are written above their reading grade level (Adams, Pegg, and Case 2015; Carter and Dean 2006). As such, the responsible effort would be aimed at providing students with strategies and models for how mathematical texts can be read, and allow them to practice their interpretation of those texts. If  “Departmentalized in Upper Elementary.” The room slowly filled with elementary teachers and administrators, and most of these instructors are responsible for teaching all subjects. I offered the questions, “Why not teach students to read mathematics textbooks?” and “What would reading instruction look like in mathematics?” Those in the room offered thoughts ranging from the perceived difficulty to poorly written texts to using mathematics as an informational text, since many state standards have a new focus on reading informational text. The consensus of participants suggested that teaching mathematical reading could be useful for students’ mathematical development, fall into state standards’ expectations for reading informational texts, and present a line of instruction not previously considered or enacted.",32,From Mathematical Reading to Mathematical Literacy
