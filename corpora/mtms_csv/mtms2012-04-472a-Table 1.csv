Real-world situations involving layers of subtraction will help students in their future work with algebra.,7,mtms2012-04-472a,,
"mMr. Carter is about to start a two-day  lesson on subtraction of integers with his sixth-grade prealgebra students. He plans to use contextualized problems that will allow his students to develop an interpretation of subtraction that involves the idea of difference. Before he begins the lesson, he asks his students to write a contextual problem involving subtraction for these two equations: 1.  (+48) – (+19) = (+ ) 29 2.  (+48) – (–19) = (+67) ",8,mtms2012-04-472a,,
"For equation 1, a student writes, “I have $48, and I went to the store and spent $19. How much do I have  left?” For equation 2, he says, “I am not sure.” This response is typical of what Carter fi nds for his whole class—his students tend to make a take-away subtraction situation for equation 1 and struggle to produce a sensible context for equation 2. Carter knows that he will have to work hard to develop a difference interpretation of subtraction. Doing so, however, will help students develop a powerful interpretation of subtraction with integers and prepare them for future work in algebra. ",9,mtms2012-04-472a,,

"One reason to highlight this topic when working with integers is because it is difficult to find problem contexts in which taking away a negative amount has a natural interpretation (Gregg and Gregg 2007). For example, to take away a negative amount in a problem involving temperature means to take away, or decrease, some amount of cold. Although it is possible to make sense of this statement, it is unnatural to develop a contextualized problem involving a decrease in the amount of cold; it is more natural for the context to involve an increase in the temperature. ",13,mtms2012-04-472a,,
"The topic of money provides another context in which it is possible to make a natural interpretation of taking away a negative amount. However, it is difficult to use a monetary context to develop problems that cover all possible cases of integer subtraction. The Bike Repair problem illustrates this point.   The Bike Repair Problem",14,mtms2012-04-472a,,
"Henry owes his friend $65. Henry fixes his friend’s bike. In exchange, his friend cancels $50 of his debt. Write an equation to determine how much money Henry will owe after he has fixed his friend’s bike.",15,mtms2012-04-472a,,
"Canceling debt provides a natural interpretation of taking away a negative amount. Debt cancellation could therefore support students to develop the equation -65 – (-50) = -15, but canceling debt only works under certain circumstances. For instance, ",16,mtms2012-04-472a,,
Many topics in algebra do not  make sense unless students interpret the subtraction sign to mean a  difference between  two quantities.,17,mtms2012-04-472a,,
"it would not make sense for Henry’s friend to cancel a debt if Henry did not owe money, so the context is unlikely to help a student develop an equation such as (+65) – (-50) = +115. These limitations of contextualized problems involving take-away subtraction provide one reason to use them to focus on a difference interpretation of subtraction. A second reason for developing this view of subtraction with prealgebra students is its link as a precursor for work in algebra (Moses and Cobb 2001). Many topics in algebra do not make sense unless students interpret the subtraction sign to mean a difference between two quantities. For example, it does not make sense to use a take-away interpretation of subtraction when finding the slope of a line because a slope is a ratio between two differences. The remainder of this article outlines a way to work with pre- algebra students on a difference interpretation of subtraction, given these two reasons.  daY 1: diFFeRences BetWeen tWo PositiVe QUantities",18,mtms2012-04-472a,,
"Students are presented with contextualized problem situations and asked to model these problems using a number line. However, this modeling  occurs only after students are asked to develop symbolic equations. One reason to use a number line representation after presenting a contextual problem and before writing an equation is that it helps students develop a meaning for difference as distance and direction. This type of interpretation is important because it helps students understand that a difference is a directed distance in the Cartesian coordinate system. ",19,mtms2012-04-472a,,
"Another model that represents a difference, specifically, the twocolor counter model, does not rely on developing differences as a directed distance on the number line. Therefore, that model is less likely to support students’ interpretation of common representations used in algebra, such as the Cartesian coordinate system, whose interpretation relies on directed distances.",20,mtms2012-04-472a,,
Reviewing Differences  with Whole Numbers,21,mtms2012-04-472a,,
"Although differences using whole numbers is a topic covered in elementary curricula, many prealgebra students will need to review key elements of how to represent a difference on the number line. The Temperature problem and the student work in figure 1 illustrate essential features of this process. ",22,mtms2012-04-472a,,
The Temperature Problem,23,mtms2012-04-472a,,

"In figure 1, a student represents  each temperature as a vector that begins at 0 and ends at the appropriate place on the number line. The vectors show each temperature reading as a distance with a direction. She represents the result of the difference  with a vector that begins at the first temperature reading, +61 degrees, and extends to the second temperature reading, +80 degrees, thus showing that the change in temperature is +19 degrees. She then writes the equation shown at the top of figure 1. ",25,mtms2012-04-472a,,
"Differences between Two Positive Quantities That Give a Negative Result Some problems can highlight the central way that differences change when using integers: The difference between two positive quantities does not have to be positive. This issue is difficult for students because the result of a difference is always assumed to be positive when working with whole numbers, and the direction of the result is not usually discussed. When working with the difference between two integers, it is critical to discuss the direction of the result because it can be negative. To introduce this idea to students, present a contextualized problem involving two positive quantities in which the problem supports a reason to consider a negative result. One example is the Scientist’s problem. ",26,mtms2012-04-472a,,
The Scientist’s Problem,27,mtms2012-04-472a,,
"At noon, a marine biologist measures the temperature of a lake. His gauge reads 46 degrees. He takes the measurement at midnight, and the lake temperature is 38 degrees. Use a number line representation, and write an equation to determine the difference in the temperature readings. ",28,mtms2012-04-472a,,
"This context contrasts with the Temperature problem. The temperature increases (it warms up) between the two readings in that problem; in this problem, the temperature decreases (it cools down) between the two readings. Therefore, a reasonable interpretation of the situation is that the result of the difference is negative and not positive. ",29,mtms2012-04-472a,,

This action helps students realize that they travel to the left on the number line, or in the negative direction. They can then record this action with a vector that shows the direction of travel (see fig. 3).",35,mtms2012-04-472a,,
"Once students have used the context and the number line to interpret the result of the difference as negative, ask them to think about how this is reflected in the situation’s equation:  (+38) – (+46) = (–8) 40",36,mtms2012-04-472a,,

"To introduce negative quantities, begin with problems that have one positive and one negative quantity.

The Snapping Turtle in the Sun Problem,44,mtms2012-04-472a,,
"A turtle is hunting for fish 4 feet beneath the surface of the lake. After his hunt, he decides to sun on a rock 3 feet above the surface of a lake. Use a number line representation, and write an equation to determine the altitude difference between the turtle’s two positions.",45,mtms2012-04-472a,,
"One student determines that the surface of the lake should represent 0 on the number line and that the 3 should be positive because it is above the surface of the lake. The 4 should be negative because it is below the surface (see fig. 4). Once she decides that one quantity is positive and one is negative, she uses the context of the problem to determine that the result should be positive because the turtle travels 7 units up, starting at -4 and ending at +3. ",46,mtms2012-04-472a,,
"After creating a number line  representation, the student writes her equation, (+3) – (-4) = +7, by simply putting the starting quantity second and the ending quantity first on the left-hand side of her equation. She determines the sign of the result on the basis of the direction the turtle travels. ",47,mtms2012-04-472a,,
"The student’s equation illustrates  nicely that when working with   differences that have a negative starting quantity, the “minus a negative is plus a positive” rule is unnecessary. It avoids the struggle to interpret what it means to take away a negative amount. The equation results from determining that the starting quantity is negative and interpreting the subtraction symbol as fi nding the distance and direction between the starting and ending quantities.

Differences between Two Negative Quantities,49,mtms2012-04-472a,,
A small adjustment of the Snapping Turtle in the Sun problem provides a context in which both the starting and ending quantities are negative.

"The primary issue for some students when solving this type of problem is that they revert to treating both quantities as positive. However, with all the previous work students have done, it is usually easy for them to work out this issue after appropriate questioning about the relationship between the surface of the lake, which represents 0,  and the turtle’s direction from the surface of the lake, which is down.

"A Final Challenge: Which Quantity Is the Starting Quantity? When students begin solving difference problems, it is important to present contexts that readily suggest that one quantity should be considered the starting quantity. The four problems provided so far had this feature. ",54,mtms2012-04-472a,,
"See, for example, the two temperature problems; one temperature reading was taken before the other, and so the context helps students determine whether the temperature has increased (warmed up) or decreased (cooled down).

"During a scuba diving expedition, some divers are investigating the sea life of a coral reef, which is off an island. One diver, Jacques, dives 40 meters below sea level to scope out the site for the investigation. Another diver, Henriette, climbs the cliffs, 50 meters above sea level, to set up equipment for filming  the expedition. Use a number  line representation, and write an  equation to show the difference in Henriette’s and Jacques’s altitudes. ",60,mtms2012-04-472a,,
"This problem’s context does not  help students determine whether the difference is supposed to start from Henriette’s position and end at Jacques’s position or vice versa. The lack of clarity in the statement of the problem leads to a good opportunity for students to interpret each situation. Figure 5 shows a student’s number line representation and equation for both interpretations. In one interpretation, she uses Jacques’s altitude as the starting quantity, meaning that Jacques would need to travel 90 meters up to reach Henriette’s altitude, the ending quantity. The direction of the result, then, is positive, and the distance is  90 meters.",61,mtms2012-04-472a,,
"In the other interpretation, she  uses Henriette’s altitude as the starting quantity, referring to the fact that Henriette would need to travel 90 meters down to reach Jacques’s altitude, the ending quantity. The direction of the result, then, is negative, and the distance is the same. Both interpretations are correct; the central issue is making sure that students can relate each interpretation to the appropriate equation. ",62,mtms2012-04-472a,,
It is important for two reasons to  introduce students to contexts that have no easily identifiable starting quantity only after they have experienced problems in which they must choose a starting quantity: ,63,mtms2012-04-472a,,
One reason to use  a number line representation  after presenting a contextual problem and before writing  an equation is because it helps students develop a  meaning for difference as distance and  direction.,64,mtms2012-04-472a,,
1.  It is more complicated for students  to provide two different interpretations of a single situation. Introduce this difficulty only when students are ready for it.,65,mtms2012-04-472a,,
2.  Students are likely to interpret  situations that have no easily identifiable starting quantity as only involving a positive result if they have not had sufficient experiences interpreting the result of the difference as negative. ,66,mtms2012-04-472a,,
"In general, contextual situations will support choosing one quantity as a starting point if they both involve comparing two measurements of the same quantity at two different points in time (e.g., comparing two temperature readings at two different times on the same day). In contrast, contextual situations will have no easily identifiable starting point if they involve comparing a measurement of two different quantities at the same time (e.g., comparing the positions  of two different people at the same time). This distinction is helpful when designing problem contexts that either do or do not support choosing the starting quantity.  conclUding ReMaRKs",67,mtms2012-04-472a,,
"Highlighting a difference interpretation of subtraction while working with integers allows teachers to use many sensible contexts with students. In contrast, contexts that pursue a take-away model of subtraction with integers often lead to an unnatural interpretation, such as decreasing the amount of cold. Moreover, without explicitly developing subtraction as a difference prior to taking an algebra course, many students are likely to continue to interpret the subtraction sign to mean taking away one amount from another. When students do so, they are able to produce results that are computationally correct but which often have no meaningful mathematical or contextual interpretation. For instance, it does not make mathematical sense to interpret the subtraction sign to mean taking away when computing the slope of a line. For these reasons, it is critical for teachers to develop a difference interpretation of subtraction to support prealgebra students. ",68,mtms2012-04-472a,,
