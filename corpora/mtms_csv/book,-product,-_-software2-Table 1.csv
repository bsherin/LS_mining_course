6,"book, product, _ software reviews (1) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","This years entry in the APME series is a collection of twenty-five articles and research papers written by a group of international educators and researchers on the subject of mathematical modeling. Chapters focus on two aspects of modeling: modeling as an instructional topic in math classrooms and models as mathematical representations used to deepen understanding of concepts in the Kgrade 12 curriculum. An interesting example of a model as an instructional tool is discussed in the chapter TouchCounts: Visual, Auditory, Haptic, and Symbolic Models for Numbers and Operations (pp. 2735). Designed for young children just developing the concept of number, the Numbers World and Operations World apps associate the operations of addition and subtraction with physical actions of pinching and splitting. The actions forge such a strong physical connection to the operations that students are subsequently observed making the pinching gesture even when adding numbers without the application (p. 34).",,

The articles provide many examples of modeling tasks and support for teachers who are implementing the activities in their classrooms or who wish to adapt or develop their own modeling tasks. There are discussions of pedagogical issues, such as the timing and degree of scaffolding to offer, as well as roadblocks that were encountered, such as students overreliance on contextual factors when attempting to simplify complex real-world situations. The book includes research into the development of modeling competencies in both teachers and students and ways to assess modeling.",,

Modeling tasks can improve student engagement and interest in learning mathematics and are an important connection between the classroom and the real world.,,

14,"book, product, _ software reviews (1) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","All teachers want students engaged in mathematically rich tasks in their classrooms, but who has the time and resources to develop such tasks and ensure that they meet the intended objectives of the lesson? Problem Solving in All Seasons, written for upper elementary school teachers, achieves this goal. It is organized into four chaptersFall, Winter, Spring, and Summerwith each chapter providing challenging, ready-to-implement tasks that are appropriate in that season for students to engage in problem-solving experiences. Each activity is described thoroughly, including various strategies that students might use as well as common misconceptions. Last, the authors describe ways to differentiate problems. Online components include editable handouts for each problem (definitely a teacher favorite).",,
15,"book, product, _ software reviews (1) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics",One engaging activity is Relay Teams. A track coach is trying to put together the best relay team and has recorded the top three times for each athlete. Students compare decimals to the thousandths and can also use the idea of the mean or median to choose the best relay team. This is an open-ended task for which students will need to defend their choices and critique the reasoning of others to decide which four athletes make the best relay team.,,
16,"book, product, _ software reviews (1) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics",This book gets a big thumbs up for providing rich tasks that teachers can pick up and implement throughout the year.,,

23,"book, product, _ software reviews (1) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","In The Call of Primes: Surprising Patterns, Peculiar Puzzles, and Other Marvels of Mathematics, Owen OShea describes a number of engaging mathematical puzzles and other noteworthy recreational mathematical topics and problems (e.g., Pythagorean triples, the Monty Hall problem, square numbers, triangular numbers, and Pascals triangle). OShea provides historical as well as other background information and makes connections among the topics covered and other areas of mathematics and beyond. Although the intended audience is mathematical and nonmathematical alike, I believe the book is best suited for those who already enjoy learning about new mathematical topics or recreational mathematics or who want to learn more about the nature of the subject. OShea clearly states that he is not a mathematician, and so none of the topics is new. Moreover, he explains the mathematics in an introductory way. OShea also devotes some of the text to describing the beauty and nature of mathematics and mathematicians to the reader as well as the differences between various areas of mathematics (e.g., pure versus applied).",,
24,"book, product, _ software reviews (1) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","This book would be best suited for teachers or secondary students who have a beginning interest in recreational mathematics. The topics could be used in both middle and secondary mathematics classrooms as enrichment topics, in math clubs, or even as a resource for a math teachers circle.",,
