0,Revisiting Mr. Tall and Mr. Short - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Ratio, rate, and proportion are central ideas in the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) for middle-grades mathematics (CCSSI 2010). These ideas closely connect to themes in earlier grades (pattern building, multiplicative reasoning, rational number concepts) and are the foundation for understanding linear functions as well as many high school mathematics and science topics. Students develop proportional reasoning slowly, and they need many experiences in diverse contexts to build their conceptual understanding (Lamon 1995). As students journey toward mature proportional reasoning, teachers can gain insight into their thinking by carefully analyzing their solution strategies on a single problem.",,
1,Revisiting Mr. Tall and Mr. Short - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Robert Karplus and his colleagues began using the Mr. Tall and Mr. Short problem (see fig. 1) in this way in the late 1960s. Karplus, Karplus, and Wollman (1974), influenced by Piaget, aimed to chart the development of abstract reasoning in young students. The Mr. Tall and Mr. Short task, unlike the original Piagetian tasks, did not require an understanding of physical principles and so was accessible to younger children.",,

4,Revisiting Mr. Tall and Mr. Short - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Beyond its use in formal research, this problem is a classroom challenge explored in the 2002 NCTM Yearbook, Making Sense of Fractions, Ratios, and Proportions (Khoury 2002). Teachers using this challenge are encouraged to assess their students at one of four broad levels of proportional thinking. In this spirit, and as part of a larger project to examine proportional reasoning, we gave the Mr. Tall and Mr. Short problem to over 400 middle school students in a small Midwestern town. Our aim in this article is to share the categories of solution strategies we found and to discuss what these strategies reveal about student thinking.",,
5,Revisiting Mr. Tall and Mr. Short - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"When teachers use the challenge with their students, our categorization may help them determine how best to nurture their students development. The classic Mr. Tall and Mr. Short problem, unfortunately, has features that blur some levels of understanding. We therefore offer variations of the problem, which give a teacher more information to better gauge a students reasoning.",,
6,Revisiting Mr. Tall and Mr. Short - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,MULTIPLICATIVE RELATIONSHIPS,,
7,Revisiting Mr. Tall and Mr. Short - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Inherent to a proportion are the multiplicative relationships between the numbers involved. To distinguish among these relationships, we use the concept of a measure space (Vergnaud 1983). Two quantities are considered to be in the same measure space when their units are the same (see fig. 2). In the Mr. Tall and Mr. Short problem, for example, there is a matchsticks measure space and a paperclips measure space. We call the multiplicative relationship of Mr. Talls height measured in matchsticks to Mr. Shorts height measured in matchsticks a within-measure-space ratio. The multiplicative relationship of Mr. Shorts height in paperclips to Mr. Shorts height in matchsticks is a between-measure-space ratio. When we refer to the number structure of a proportion, we mean both the within- and between-measure-space ratios.",,
8,Revisiting Mr. Tall and Mr. Short - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
9,Revisiting Mr. Tall and Mr. Short - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In a proportion, the two within-measure-space ratios are equal and the two between-measure-space ratios are equal. That is, the matchstick-to-matchstick relationship is the same as the paperclip-to-paperclip relationship (A:a = B:b), and the matchstick-to-paperclip relationship for Mr. Short is the same as the matchstick-to-paperclip relationship for Mr. Tall (A:B = a:b). (See fig. 2.)",,
10,Revisiting Mr. Tall and Mr. Short - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Students succeed in solving proportion problems when they have at least a rudimentary understanding of one of these multiplicative relationships. When they understand both, they will flexibly choose to use whichever relationship permits an efficient solution. This more robust understanding allows students to apply and extend the power of proportional reasoning in diverse settings. As their experience with proportional situations increases, students will also be able to decontextualize and think of proportions algebraically or as equivalent fractions. Only at this point, we maintain, is an algorithmic approach of solving the resulting equation a desirable strategy (Steinthorsdottir and Sriraman 2009).",,

13,Revisiting Mr. Tall and Mr. Short - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,HOW DO STUDENTS SOLVE  THE PROBLEM?,,
14,Revisiting Mr. Tall and Mr. Short - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In our study, the Mr. Tall and Mr. Short problem was part of a pencil-and-paper instrument in which students were instructed to explain their thinking. We coded student explanations by using two categories for erroneous strategies, illogical and additive, and two categories for correct reasoning, build-up and multiplicative. We then refined the multiplicative category to capture how students used the multiplicative structure of the proportion. Table 1 defines these categories; table 2 provides a breakdown of strategy by grade. In the following paragraphs, we illustrate each category with student work and discuss possible interpretations.",,
15,Revisiting Mr. Tall and Mr. Short - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
16,Revisiting Mr. Tall and Mr. Short - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The illogical category is a collection of error strategies for work that shows little understanding of proportions. Numbers given in the problem may be combined haphazardly, as in figure 3a, in which the three numbers are summed, or in figure 3b, in which two numbers are multiplied. Also classified as illogical is the work in figure 3c; in this example, the student seems to compare two quantities additively and then applies the result multiplicatively.",,
17,Revisiting Mr. Tall and Mr. Short - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
18,Revisiting Mr. Tall and Mr. Short - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In the additive category, students use absolute comparisons rather than relative comparisons. Figure 4a shows how a student computes the between-measure-space difference (Mr. Short is 6 paperclips or 4 matchsticks tall, which are 2 apart) and maintains that difference for Mr. Tall. In figure 4b, the student instead computes the within-measure-space difference  (6 matchsticks for Mr. Tall compared with 4 for Mr. Short) and answers that Mr. Talls height in paperclips is 2 more than Mr. Shorts. Figure 4c illustrates a strategy in which a student declares that there is a difference of two in everything, and, therefore, Mr. Tall is 8 paperclips in height.",,
19,Revisiting Mr. Tall and Mr. Short - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
20,Revisiting Mr. Tall and Mr. Short - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"As table 2 shows, although the majority of students reason incorrectly, the distribution of errors changes with grade level. Between the fifth grade and the sixth grade, answers falling into the illogical category decreased from 48 percent to 23 percent, whereas those falling into the additive category increased from 39 percent to 60 percent. For seventh grade and eighth grade, the percentage of illogical answers is essentially the same as that for the sixth grade, whereas the percentage of additive answers declines to 50 percent and 33 percent, respectively. This may indicate that more mature students recognize the need to compare quantities, although many students choose the incorrect type of comparison. In the next section, we conjecture that this specific problem has features that lure students into additive thinking when they might not use it to solve a different problem.",,
21,Revisiting Mr. Tall and Mr. Short - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In using a build-up strategy, students recognize that the ratio of Mr. Shorts 4 matchsticks to 6 paperclips forms a unit that needs to be coordinated. This unit (the between-measure-space ratio) can then be joined repeatedly to the same ratio, joined to an equivalent ratio, or partitioned (Lobato et al. 2010). In each case, the result will be an equivalent ratio. Students use this knowledge to generate equivalent ratios of 4:6 until a desired ratio is found.",,
22,Revisiting Mr. Tall and Mr. Short - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Figures 5a and 5b are examples that show how the total number of paperclips is determined by computing the number of extras needed by Mr. Tall to account for his 2 extra matchsticks. In figure 5a, the rate of 1.5 paperclips/matchstick is added  to the original ratio 6:4 twice. In figure 5b, the unit rate is computed (using the figure), and then the equivalent ratio 2:3 is added to the original 4:6 to reach the ratio 6:9. In both cases, students join equivalent ratios to create a newly composed ratio of 6 matchsticks to 9 paperclips. In figure 5c, the student uses 6 iterations of 1.5:1, one for each matchstick, to create a new composed ratio of 6:9.",,
23,Revisiting Mr. Tall and Mr. Short - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Multiplicative strategies explicitly use one of the proportions multiplicative relationships (either the between-measure or within-measure space). The between-measures strategy (comparing paperclips with matchsticks) is applied when students explicitly use the fact that Mr. Shorts measurement is 1 1/2 times greater in paperclips than in matchsticks (or 2/3 as much in matchsticks as in paperclips), and hence so is Mr. Talls. In figure 6a, the student uses the factor of 1.5 with the unwritten units paperclips/matchsticks, and so is employing the between- measure-space ratio.",,
24,Revisiting Mr. Tall and Mr. Short - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
25,Revisiting Mr. Tall and Mr. Short - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"On the other hand, the within-measures strategy compares matchsticks with matchsticks and paperclips with paperclips. Students determine a scale factor, perhaps in one step (6 matchsticks  4 matchsticks; see fig. 6b) or after reducing the original ratio of matchsticks to paperclips to 2:3 or 1:1.5 (see figs. 6c and 6d). The scale factor is then applied to Mr. Shorts paperclip measurement to find Mr. Talls measurement. Note that the extra step of reducing the original ratio results in a simpler integer scale factor, and thus, finding the unit rate does not necessarily imply the use of the between-measure-space relationship.",,
26,Revisiting Mr. Tall and Mr. Short - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
27,Revisiting Mr. Tall and Mr. Short - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
28,Revisiting Mr. Tall and Mr. Short - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"For other responses, we cannot determine whether the students used a build-up strategy or a multiplicative strategy. The strategy in figure 7b is an example. It is clear that the student reduced the given ratio 4:6 to 2:3, but it is unclear whether the student then found the equivalent ratio of 6:9 by adding the ratios 4:6 and 2:3 or if the student applied the scale factor of 3 to the 2:3 ratio. This type of work is coded as ambiguous in table 2.",,
29,Revisiting Mr. Tall and Mr. Short - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The percentage of students using a correct strategy increased from 13 percent in fifth grade to 16 percent in sixth grade, to 27 percent in seventh grade, and to 45 percent in eighth grade. As expected, the use of multiplicative strategies increased by grade level, from 2 percent in fifth grade to 29 percent in eighth grade (see table 2). When students annotated their work, the within-measures multiplicative strategy was preferred.",,
30,Revisiting Mr. Tall and Mr. Short - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We believe that many students begin with a build-up strategy, in which the tendency is to compute how to transform the given number of matchsticks into the target number and then duplicate the operation for the paperclip quantity. The transition from repeated addition to a scaling operation (a within-measures strategy) is natural. Prior research, although not conclusive, supports this idea (Steinthorsdottir and Sriraman 2009). Problem context, number structure, and other factors also affect student choices, and we perhaps define the between-measure-space strategy more narrowly than do other researchers.",,
31,Revisiting Mr. Tall and Mr. Short - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,WHY IS THE SUCCESS RATE LOW?,,
32,Revisiting Mr. Tall and Mr. Short - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Older students correctly solve this problem more frequently than younger students, but their success rate is surprisingly low. Our numbers are similar to those reported by Karplus, Karplus, and Wollman (1974). For example, 29 percent of our 412 students (grades 58) correctly solved the problem, and 44 percent used additive reasoning. Karplus, Karplus, and Wollman (1974) report that 37 percent of 610 students (grades 49) used correct reasoning and 32 percent used additive reasoning.",,
33,Revisiting Mr. Tall and Mr. Short - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"It is important to consider what makes this problem harder than expected. The Mr. Tall and Mr. Short problem uses a scaling context, which Lamon (1993) argues is difficult. Although the numbers involved are small, both the within- and between-measure-space ratios are 1 1/2. Research is clear in stating that integer relationships are easier than non- integer relationships, and yet one would expect that 1/2 relationships would be the next easiest. This does not appear to be true for the 1 1/2 relationship because, we argue, 1 1/2 is less than 1 full repeat.",,
34,Revisiting Mr. Tall and Mr. Short - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Consider, for example, the problem 4:6 = 14:x, in which the scale factor is 3 1/2. Students with a beginning understanding of proportion can build up using whole units: 4:6, then 8:12, and then 12:18. The target is not quite reached. Some students will partition 4:6 to correctly finish the build-up (2:3 joined to 12:18 gives 14:21). Other students will fall back on additive thinking to finish the problem, adding 2 to both quantities and getting the incorrect answer of 14:20. Two levels of understanding are uncovered in this case.",,
35,Revisiting Mr. Tall and Mr. Short - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"With a scale factor of 1 1/2, students must immediately deal with the fractional part. In this case, students who can build up with integer repeats but fail when faced with leftovers are indistinguishable from students who are thinking additively.",,
36,Revisiting Mr. Tall and Mr. Short - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,The small numbers in this problem also mean that the relative difference (6  4 = 1.5) and absolute difference (6  4 = 2) between the numbers are approximately the same. The incorrect additive answer is thus in the ballpark and may not alert students to an error. The fact that 6 appears as a measurement in both ratios may also be a source of confusion.,,
37,Revisiting Mr. Tall and Mr. Short - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,SHOULD YOU ACCEPT THE MR. TALL AND MR. SHORT CHALLENGE?,,
38,Revisiting Mr. Tall and Mr. Short - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"No one problem can fully assess proportional reasoning. In fact, mature proportional reasoning is indicated by the successful navigation of a variety of problems from diverse contexts, no matter the complexity of the number structures involved. On the other hand, teachers do learn much from a careful analysis of a single problem and can use the resulting information to make instructional decisions.",,
39,Revisiting Mr. Tall and Mr. Short - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We recommend trying one of the following variations of Mr. Tall and Mr. Short to delve more deeply into your students thinking. First, consider which broad category of reasoning (illogical, additive, build-up, or multiplicative) you expect most of your students to use. See table 1 and note that table 2 suggests that you may see all reasoning categories in your classroom. Then choose a variation that will enable you to verify and refine your assessment. The first two problems are appropriate for novice students and are designed to reveal a range of sophistication in build-up strategies. The last two problems should allow you to assess how robust and flexible your students are in the use of multiplicative strategies. The classic problem (see fig. 1) may be most illuminating in assessing experienced students. You may discover that some students fall back into additive thinking, and you will thus be able to address their misconceptions.",,
40,Revisiting Mr. Tall and Mr. Short - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,4 matchsticks:6 paperclips =  20 matchsticks:x paperclips. This problem uses a whole-number scale factor. This simple case can launch discussions on relative  versus absolute comparisons. Correct solutions will distinguish between students using build-up and multiplicative strategies.,,
41,Revisiting Mr. Tall and Mr. Short - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"4 matchsticks:6 paperclips =  14 matchsticks:x paperclips. This problem has a scale factor of 3.5. Because this factor is more than 1 full repeat, you can determine how students deal with leftovers. Which students have a basic understanding of the build-up strategy, and which use techniques that are more sophisticated?",,
42,Revisiting Mr. Tall and Mr. Short - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"4 matchsticks:6 paperclips =  x matchsticks: 9 paperclips. This problem is similar to the classic problem but removes the potentially distracting second appearance of the 6 and allows you to determine which multiplicative strategy your students are using. Because the scale factor is 1.5, you may see some students lured back into additive thinking.",,
43,Revisiting Mr. Tall and Mr. Short - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"6 matchsticks:12 paperclips =  22 matchsticks:x paperclips. This problem uses a messy scale factor of 3 2/3. Which measure space ratio do your students use? The between-measures ratio clearly leads to a more efficient solution, but you may still see students scaling by the within-measures ratio. Use this opportunity to compare and discuss solution strategies and the multiplicative relationships in a proportion.",,
44,Revisiting Mr. Tall and Mr. Short - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Once you know how your students are thinking about proportions, you can guide them to explore all aspects of the multiplicative structure of proportion. As they expand their repertoire of solution techniques, they strengthen the connections among division, fractions, and rational numbers, and they lay the groundwork for working with slopes and rates of change in functions. You can help your students navigate their routes to reason.",,
