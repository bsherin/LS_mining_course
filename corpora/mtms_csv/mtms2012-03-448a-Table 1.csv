"When the wood is properly stacked, the volume of a cord is  128 ft.3 (4 ft. × 4 ft. × 8 ft.).  1.  Friendly Firewood Co. tells the  customer that the amount of wood in the truck is approximately  3/4 cord. What is the volume  (in cubic feet) of 3/4 cord of stacked firewood? 2.

Explain whether the information  communicated by the driver is  accurate.    Several states have laws regarding  accurate firewood measurement. In Minnesota, for example, a full cord of firewood is “175 cubic feet when thrown irregularly and loosely into a conveyance for delivery” (Minnesota Statutes 2010).",6,mtms2012-03-448a,,
"4.  Given this fact, approximately what fraction of a cord is the loosely piled wood in the pickup truck?  5.  How do you explain the difference  between this estimate and your estimate in problem 2?",7,mtms2012-03-448a,,
