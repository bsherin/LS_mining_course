"As we move forward in the twenty-first century, information and its communication have become at least as important as the production of material goods, and the nonmaterial world of information processing requires the use of discrete mathematics (NCTM 1989). Combinatorics, the mathematics of counting, plays a significant role in discrete mathematics. It is usually described as having three parts: counting (how many things meet our description), optimization (which is the best), and existence (are there any at all). The NCTM is explicit about the importance of students learning discrete mathematics: “As an active branch of contemporary mathematics that is widely used in business and industry, discrete mathematics should be an  lynn d. tarlow, ltarlow@ ccny.cuny.edu, teaches mathematics education at the City College of New York, CUNY, New York, NY 10031.

"Research indicates, however, that students find combinatorics difficult to learn (e.g., Batanero, NavarroPelayo, and Godino 1997; Eisenberg and Zaslovsky 2004). Many students associate combinatorics with negative experiences calculating permutations and combinations, often confusing one with the other (Sriraman and English 2004). One explanation offered for this difficulty may be the manner in which combinatorics is traditionally taught—through a teacher’s demonstrated use of conventional, symbolic notation and algorithms. “Students often face an overwhelming difficulty when studying combinatorics. They are given many formulas (with little justification), they attempt to memorize these formulas (with no relational framework), and the resulting confusion can be disastrous” (Schielack 1991, p. 137).

"This article describes a mathematics session in which students were thoughtfully engaged in investigating a challenging combinatorics task. Initial- ly, the students attempted to recall and apply an algorithm but later abandoned their attempts. Instead, they developed meaningful, personal representations to use to make sense of the problem. They were successful in finding a solution and justified their solution using a proof by cases. A look at the session may provide insight into how teachers can support students’ development of combinatorial reasoning. ",5,mtms2008-04-484a,,

"An after-school mathematics program was formed, and students from three different schools voluntarily met together to explore problem-solving tasks. They were offered no rewards for doing so. They were given opportunities to work on complex, challenging problems; to think carefully about their ideas; and to discuss their ideas with their peers and with the teacher. (For further discussion of the work of these students, see Tarlow 2004.)

Creating such an environment is based on the view that as students build connections between and among different representational systems, their thinking and reasoning also develop (Maher 2005; NCTM 2000). Mathematics teachers can facilitate students’ use of representations flexibly and appropriately and encourage them by listening, questioning, and making a sincere effort to understand what they are trying to communicate with their drawings or writings as they create and use meaningful, personal representations to support their thinking. “It is important that students have opportunities not only to learn conventional forms of representations but also to construct, refine, and use their own representations as tools to support learning and doing mathematics” (NCTM 2000, p. 68).  a look at a  MatheMatiCS SeSSion",8,mtms2008-04-484a,,

The solution can be represented by a generalization that may be justified using  different methods. The choice to select or not, for each topping of the given number of toppings on a pizza, is independent.

They were invited to explore ideas, develop representations, invent notations, devise strategies, make conjectures, test their methods, discuss their ideas with their peers, and justify their solutions.

As they continued working, they revised their representation to include symbols—letter codes—instead of the full names to represent the toppings. (See fig. 4.) In addition, since they had recognized the need to organize their pizzas to avoid duplicating topping combinations, they modified the tree diagram. They organized the pizzas by cases according to the number of toppings—0, 1, 2, 3, 4 toppings—for 1, 4, 6, 4, 1 topping combinations, a total of 16 pizzas. (See fig. 5.)

"If our goal is for students to make sense of mathematics in general and combinatorics in particular, then these findings suggest that we must give students time to develop their own meaningful representations so as to have the foundation necessary to make sense of mathematical abstractions. As the students explored a challenging combinatorics task, they built, refined, and linked meaningful, personal representations. They developed a progression of representations that became increasingly symbolic and abstract, which they used to find a solution to the Pizza problem, to provide a justification for their solution and to develop combinatorial reasoning. ",50,mtms2008-04-484a,,
"Stephanie and Shelly abandoned their frustrating attempts to remember a combinatorics algorithm and decided instead to plot out the pizza choices by drawing a tree diagram. As they recognized the need to avoid duplicating topping combinations in their tree diagram, they modified their representation. In their revised tree diagram, they organized their topping combinations by cases, according to the number of toppings, to determine the number of possible pizza choices. This revised representation supported their development of a justification for their solution by using a proof by cases. They then linked representations: They connected their cases to the numbers on Pascal’s triangle and used this new representation to “know what all the pizzas [for any number of available toppings] are.” ",51,mtms2008-04-484a,,
"These students’ use of personal  representations was critical for their development of meaningful ideas in combinatorics, a topic that has been shown to cause difficulty for students when taught traditionally. Although we cannot make generalizations based on one case, looking closely  at the growth of the students’ mathematical ideas and movement through their representations, however, gives us a window into what can occur in a classroom. These findings suggest that combinatorics notation and algorithms should not be imposed on students, but rather students should be allowed time to develop these ideas in environments that encourage them to build, refine, and connect meaningful, personal representations.",52,mtms2008-04-484a,,
