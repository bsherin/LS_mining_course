4,Math for Real: The Battle of Antietam,"The Battle of Antietam (also called the Battle of Sharpsburg), fought on September 17, 1862, is frequently described as the bloodiest single day of fighting during the American Civil War. To explore the significance of the battle’s large number of casualties, which include both Union and Confederate dead, wounded, and missing or captured, we can convert the data in terms of the current American population. In so doing, we wish to answer this question: What was the social impact of this battle, and how can we quantify it?",4,Math for Real: The Battle of Antietam
