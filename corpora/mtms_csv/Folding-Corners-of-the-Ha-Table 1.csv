2,Folding Corners of the Habits of Mind,"Goldenberg, and Mark refer to as mathematical habits of mind (1996). “Reasoning is an integral part of doing mathematics. Students should enter the middle grades with the view that mathematics involves examining patterns and noting regularities, making conjectures about possible generalizations, and evaluating the conjectures” (NCTM 2000, p. 262). Mathematical habits of mind are the practices that mathematicians use in their work, such as searching for patterns, experimenting, tinkering, describing, inventing, visualizing, and  conjecturing. Teachers who wish to promote these habits in their students, however, are faced with the daunting challenge of fi nding tasks that can develop and further such habits. ",2,Folding Corners of the Habits of Mind
3,Folding Corners of the Habits of Mind,"A paper-folding task can be an effective vehicle for such mathematical reasoning. When one thinks of origami and its connections to mathematics, images of intricate folded geometric models come to mind. In this capacity, origami has great potential for enriching mathematics classrooms (Cipoletti and Wilson 2004; DeYoung 2009; Higginson and Colgan 2001).

14,Folding Corners of the Habits of Mind,"Habits of mind, as originally defi ned, should permeate all mathematics instruction. The framework, originally applied to high school curricula, is equally applicable to the middle grades  and elementary school (Goldenberg, Mark, and Cuoco 2010; Mark et al. 2010). One can easily see these ideas being made explicit in the Standards for Mathematical Practice (CCSSI 2010), which represent the latest move toward specifying how students should experience mathematical ideas. Although general habits of mind, or mathematical practices, are important, it is also helpful to focus on those habits of mind that are specialized to the mathematical concepts being studied. Driscoll (2007) identifi ed four geometric habits of mind (GHoM) that are central to the study of geometry:  1.  Reasoning with relationships 2.  Generalizing geometric ideas 3.  Investigating invariants 4.  Balancing exploration and refl ection ",14,Folding Corners of the Habits of Mind
15,Folding Corners of the Habits of Mind,"The fi rst GHoM, reasoning with  relationships, concerns identifying key properties in objects and then exploring relationships between properties and the geometric elements in the problem. The second GHoM, generalizing geometric ideas, can be seen when students explore a geometric problem and use insights to better understand related or larger problems. Students with this habit of mind ask  t h  t h  f o l d s   p r o d u c e d   w i f o l d s   p r o d u c e d   w i i s i n g l y  i s i n g l y  r e v e a l e d   s u r p r r e v e a l e d   s u r p r i o n s h i p s .",15,Folding Corners of the Habits of Mind

The third GHoM, investigating invariants, involves actively transforming a geometric object and refl ecting on what aspects of the situation remain the same in the midst of that change. The last GHoM, balancing exploration and refl ection, involves turning one’s thinking inward while exploring a model or situation.

20,Folding Corners of the Habits of Mind,"A paper-folding activity, created by Kazuo Haga (2008), was posed to a class of preservice teachers in a geometry course for elementary school and middle school teachers. Haga called the paper-folding process origamics, in contrast to traditional origami. This process moved beyond simply creating paper models and producing a fi nal product to a process of folding and unfolding paper to highlight invariant properties. Origamics-related problems often involved simple folds that revealed surprisingly rich geometric relationships.",20,Folding Corners of the Habits of Mind
21,Folding Corners of the Habits of Mind,The version of Haga’s problem  used with students was referred to as a turned-up-point (TUP) problem by Hull (2006). Hull described both the mathematical ideas imbedded in the exploration as well as notes on their pedagogical uses. Hull’s Project Origami: Activities for Exploring Mathematics and Haga’s Origamics: Mathematical Explorations through Paper Folding detailed several other explorations in  origamics that could be transformed into rich classroom activities. ,21,Folding Corners of the Habits of Mind
22,Folding Corners of the Habits of Mind,"The turned-up-point, or TUP,  problem involves folding the corner of a piece of paper and examining the shape of the fl ap that is formed. More precisely, begin with a square piece of paper and pick a point anywhere in the interior of the paper. Fold the paper so that the bottom right vertex falls on this point (see fi g. 1). Focus attention on the fl ap that is folded up (the shaded portions in fi g. 1) and determine how many sides that polygonal fl ap has. Repeat this process several times with different interior points to answer the following two questions:  1.  What is the possible number of  sides of the polygonal fl ap? 2.  How can you predict the number  of sides that the fl ap will have, viewing only the location of the point on the paper?",22,Folding Corners of the Habits of Mind
23,Folding Corners of the Habits of Mind,I encourage the reader to get a square piece of paper and try this before moving on. ,23,Folding Corners of the Habits of Mind
24,Folding Corners of the Habits of Mind,"After some exploration, it becomes apparent that the fl ap can be a triangle or a quadrilateral only. The only way to form a pentagonal fl ap is to extend the bottom-right corner off the paper. The focus of the exploration, then, is to determine precisely when the fl ap is a triangle and when it is a quadrilateral. Figure 1b shows a fold that results in a quadrilateral. Notice that this quadrilateral fl ap is formed precisely because the creased fold intersects the left edge of the paper rather than the bottom edge. Similarly, based on the symmetry of the square, choosing ",24,Folding Corners of the Habits of Mind

26,Folding Corners of the Habits of Mind,The key to fi nding where the transition from a triangle to a quadrilateral will occur is to note all those points where the folded crease intersects the bottom-left vertex. These points form a circular arc centered at the lower-left vertex whose radius is equal to the length of the side of the square (see fi g. 2a). Repeat this process for points on the left of the diagonal to form the boundary that separates a triangle from a quadrilateral (see fi g. 2b).  oppoRtUnities FoR deVeloping haBits oF Mind,26,Folding Corners of the Habits of Mind

28,Folding Corners of the Habits of Mind,Fig. 2 Folding a corner to various points yields a triangle and folding to other points yields a quadrilateral.

It had a low barrier to entry for mathematical knowledge. Preservice teachers at different levels could immediately begin work.  3.  It was exploratory by design and offered numerous opportunities for discussion. ,30,Folding Corners of the Habits of Mind
31,Folding Corners of the Habits of Mind,"Beyond these general features, the task also offered opportunities for the preservice teachers to engage in each of the four geometric habits of mind described earlier.

33,Folding Corners of the Habits of Mind,"The TUP problem statement was essentially a question about invariance. To predict which points resulted in triangle fl aps, for instance, the preservice teachers could not actually test them all. Instead, they needed to identify those characteristics that these points shared. They identifi ed what stayed the same about the paper for the fl ap to remain a triangle and what changed to shift to a quadrilateral. ",33,Folding Corners of the Habits of Mind
34,Folding Corners of the Habits of Mind,"All the preservice teachers began  the exploration with a form of empirical investigation. Some began folding the paper repeatedly; others took a more systematic approach and marked points that they tested (see fi g. 3). After the teachers had tested several points, they were asked to articulate what they thought was true about the triangle points. This required them to shift their focus from empirical testing to making conjectures.",34,Folding Corners of the Habits of Mind
35,Folding Corners of the Habits of Mind,"The initial conjectures were often  imprecise. For example, some preservice teachers noted that triangles were “on the inside” and quadrilaterals were “close to the edge.” Although imprecise, these statements marked  an important change in students’ reasoning. I asked one preservice teacher, Sarah, about an oval fi gure she had drawn on the paper. She explained that the fi gure was the “boundary between triangle land and quadrilateral land.” Her explanations indicated to me that she was no longer testing individual points. She was focusing her attention on the boundary and how the fl ap was transitioning dynamically from one shape to another. This process of noticing regularity in the midst of change is the essence of investigating invariance. ",35,Folding Corners of the Habits of Mind

37,Folding Corners of the Habits of Mind,"As mentioned earlier, this problem had a very low barrier to entry. The preservice teachers could begin folding and testing points right away. To solve this problem, however, they had to recognize when to stop folding and when to begin refl ecting on the information that was collected. This is the central nature of Driscoll’s third GHoM: balancing exploration and refl ection. ",37,Folding Corners of the Habits of Mind
38,Folding Corners of the Habits of Mind,"Although the preservice teachers began working easily, it was diffi cult for many of them to recognize when there was enough information to start analyzing. Rather than simply telling them when to stop folding, I instead asked what they were noticing. Those who could not verbalize their thinking were encouraged to pay close attention to what they were noticing while making a few more folds.",38,Folding Corners of the Habits of Mind
39,Folding Corners of the Habits of Mind,"The most effective way to shift the preservice teachers’ focus from exploration to refl ection, however, was through whole-class discussions. Because it was diffi cult for students to directly refer to the marks on their small paper in a way that everyone could see, they were forced to put their ideas into words. It also shifted the discussion to the mathematical relationships they were noticing rather than the actual folds they had made. ",39,Folding Corners of the Habits of Mind

43,Folding Corners of the Habits of Mind,Reasoning with Relationships,43,Folding Corners of the Habits of Mind
44,Folding Corners of the Habits of Mind,"For the preservice teachers to explain their ideas in mathematically precise ways, their attention had to change. Rather than accumulating points that generated triangles or quadrilaterals, they were now required to reason about the relationships they were identifying. This was the essence of the second GHoM: generalizing geometric ideas. Several preservice teachers tried to reason about their conjectures by trying to identify relationships between the points and the symmetries of the square. When using square paper, it was natural to fold the paper in half either vertically or diagonally, highlighting lines of symmetry. Some conjectured that the quadrants formed by the perpendicular bisectors separated the triangle points from the quadrilateral points (see fig. 4). Although this conjecture was not true, it did indicate that they were actively searching for relationships within the square. ",44,Folding Corners of the Habits of Mind
45,Folding Corners of the Habits of Mind,"Exploring the diagonal lines of symmetry for the square was more productive. Jessica, a preservice teacher, was excited to share with the class her discovery that the flap was always a  triangle along one of the diagonals but that it shifted between triangles and quadrilaterals along the other diagonal. Others in the class chimed in, realizing that the first diagonal highlighted symmetry in the problem and that they needed to focus on only one side of it. ",45,Folding Corners of the Habits of Mind
46,Folding Corners of the Habits of Mind,"For many other preservice teach- ers, it was apparent that the boundary between points that yielded triangles and those that yielded quadrilaterals was some kind of curve. Much like Sarah’s designation of “triangle land,” several people also sketched possible curves based on their empirical evidence but could not describe the curve mathematically. An important realization occurred when Jessica reflected on her discovery about the diagonal. She demonstrated how, when you slowly moved the flap, the transition occurred when the side of the flap was the entire bottom edge of the paper. After further class discussion, Eric demonstrated rotating that flap along the circular arc to show the whole boundary. Jessica’s suggestion to focus on the relationship between the flap and the edge of the square was central to generating a consensus about the solution.  geneRalizing geoMetRic ideas",46,Folding Corners of the Habits of Mind
47,Folding Corners of the Habits of Mind,"Discovering a solution often marks the end of a mathematical exploration. According to the GHoM framework,  however, we also want to instill an inclination to wonder about how the solution generalizes to new situations. After the preservice teachers found the solution, the class discussed the essential features of the problem itself. What were the unique features of this problem? It involved a square piece of paper, folding a corner to an interior point on the paper, and looking at the shape of the flap. I then asked the class to consider these features and decide if one or more of them could be changed to create a new problem. One appropriate response was that one might start with a general rectangular piece of paper or investigate folding to points that are not on the paper. ",47,Folding Corners of the Habits of Mind
48,Folding Corners of the Habits of Mind,"The process of generalization was quite difficult for the preservice teachers. Identifying the central elements of the problem and brainstorming possible modifications took much effort, almost as much as solving the initial problem. By doing this, however, they had to decide what constituted a natural generalization of the original problem. They also had to use their intuition to decide which new problem would be interesting. Last, they needed to reflect on how elements of the solution to the original problem ",48,Folding Corners of the Habits of Mind

51,Folding Corners of the Habits of Mind,"As a class, they decided to explore an extension in which the paper was a general rectangle rather than a square. The solution to this new problem relies on the same relationships discovered in the original problem. As before, circular arcs will form the boundary between the regions. This time, however, the circles have different radii (see fi g. 5a). ",51,Folding Corners of the Habits of Mind
52,Folding Corners of the Habits of Mind,"With the new paper shape, the  preservice teachers repeatedly folded the paper, gathering empirical data as with the square paper. When they were encouraged to refl ect on the solution using square paper, there were defi nite signs of generalization. Some students folded and formed a region on the rectangular paper congruent to the one found with the square paper in which the circle’s radius was the length of the short side. Others drew curved regions between the opposite vertices, reminiscent of the solution  with the square (see fi g. 5b). Only after careful exploration and further classroom discussion did the correct relationships fi nally become clear.  the BRoad pictURe",52,Folding Corners of the Habits of Mind
53,Folding Corners of the Habits of Mind,"Activities such as the TUP paperfolding exploration are enriching tasks because they can motivate and interest students. However, they can also serve an even deeper purpose. By focusing on geometric habits of mind, our students not only have opportunities to explore important geometric ideas but also learn how to test ideas, make conjectures, pose new questions, and feel the thrill of uncovering relationships that appear, seemingly, out of nowhere. These ideas are, by no means, limited to paper folding. I encourage you, the reader, to consider how these ideas might be similarly infused in your geometry lessons as well.
