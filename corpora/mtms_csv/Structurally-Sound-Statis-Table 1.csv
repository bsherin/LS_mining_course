0,Structurally Sound Statistics Instruction - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The Common Cores Standards for Mathematical Practice (SMP) call for all Kgrade 12 students to develop expertise in the processes and proficiencies of doing mathematics. However, the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSM) (CCSSI 2010) as a whole addresses students learning of not only mathematics but also statistics.",,
1,Structurally Sound Statistics Instruction - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"This situation raises an important question: How might teaching with the SMP be different when implementing statistics content standards compared with mathematics content standards? This article presents key points that arose as we explored this question for SMP 7, Look for and make use of structure (CCSSI 2010, p. 8), when designing a professional learning experience about the SMP for middle-grades mathematics teachers.",,
2,Structurally Sound Statistics Instruction - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"SMP 7 intends to focus students attention on structuresearching for and using patterns, principles, theorems, and other aspectsto make sense of mathematics and statistics tasks. Students are expected to discern a pattern or structure . . . step back for an overview and shift perspective (CCSSI 2010, p. 8). This includes recognizing how quantities can be represented in various ways and making connections across mathematical and statistical topics (Bostic and Matney 2015, 2016; Fennell, Kobett, and Wray 2013). In sum, students are expected to search for and use the patterns or structure found within mathematics and statistics tasks as a way to make sense of problems. However, differences in the nature of structure exhibited in mathematical tasks versus statistical tasks present challenges for middle-grades teachers who are expected to encourage SMP 7 with their students. To that end, teachers need support to make sense of differing notions of structure across mathematics and statistics content, including experiences doing mathematics and statistics that highlight unique and important structural elements. In this article, we describe differences between structure in mathematics and statistics; then we compare two pairs of tasks (one mathematical and one statistical) as a way to foster teachers ideas about structure and teaching SMP 7.",,
3,Structurally Sound Statistics Instruction - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,STRUCTURE IN MATHEMATICS AND STATISTICS,,
4,Structurally Sound Statistics Instruction - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"A fundamental difference exists between the structure found in mathematics and the structure used in statistics. In mathematics, the structure is typically clear and apparent, whereas in statistics, inherent variability often obscures the underlying structure. A mathematical example given in the description of SMP 7 describes how students will look for the structure used to do multiplication problems like 10  12 through an easier method of doing (10  10) + (10  2), using the distributive property of multiplication (CCSSI 2010, p. 8). Further investigations allow a problem solver to discern that this mathematical structure is always true for any real number, which makes it more obvious and easier to detect. This is a general trend when perceiving structure in mathematical tasks; that is, it is unobscured and readily apparent.",,
5,Structurally Sound Statistics Instruction - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Structure presented in statistical tasks, on the other hand, is usually masked and more difficult to identify because of the inherent variability in data (Franklin et al. 2007). This ubiquitous variation is, in fact, the reason why statistics exists as a discipline (Cobb and Moore 1997). Variability in data has three primary sources:",,
6,Structurally Sound Statistics Instruction - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"1. Natural variability, which occurs because individuals or objects of study are inherently different;",,
7,Structurally Sound Statistics Instruction - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"2. Measurement variability, which arises from variation in repeated measurements of the same attribute of the object of study; and",,
8,Structurally Sound Statistics Instruction - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"3. Induced variability, in which a statistical study is designed so that different conditions are experienced by different groups of individuals participating in the study (Franklin et al. 2007).",,
9,Structurally Sound Statistics Instruction - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"As a result, some processes will generate noisy data without a clear and obvious structure (Konold and Pollatsek 2002). For example, data collected on students heights and hand spans are noisy in that students with the same hand span can have different heights; students with the same height can have different hand spans; and even though these variables have a positive linear association (see fig. 2b), it is not always the case that taller students have bigger hands. Therefore, the underlying structure of a positive linear association between students heights and hand spans is hidden in the noisy data, which can make it challenging to detect.",,
10,Structurally Sound Statistics Instruction - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLES,,
11,Structurally Sound Statistics Instruction - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,This section presents two paired examples of contrasting tasks in mathematics and statistics designed to illustrate how implementing SMP 7 looks different in mathematical and statistical settings for middle school instruction. Middle school mathematics teachers explored these examples within the context of a professional development program. They found the tasks and ideas presented here useful while learning about SMP 7 and how its implementation differs between mathematics and statistics when teaching content standards. Teachers comments related to learning about SMP 7 through these examples are shared as well. All names in the article are pseudonyms.,,
12,Structurally Sound Statistics Instruction - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Framing Teachers Learning Experiences about SMP 7,,
13,Structurally Sound Statistics Instruction - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Middle school mathematics teachersparticipating in a yearlong professional development program to support their learning of the SMP within the grades 68 statistics and probability content standardsattended a full-day workshop, led by the authors, that focused on SMP 7. The teachers were asked to share their ideas about SMP 7 at the start of the workshop, and broadly speaking, the teachers expressed confusion. Some stated that this SMP was meant to focus students attention on the rules, theorems, principles, and axioms that govern mathematics. Josephine, a sixth- and seventh-grade teacher, pointed out, Structure reminds me of a frame for a house or building. The structure is the foundation and frame. So, we [teachers] should help students understand the rules in math that allow us to do what we do. The authors used this metaphor as the basis to further explore structure within univariate and bivariate settings.",,
14,Structurally Sound Statistics Instruction - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
15,Structurally Sound Statistics Instruction - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Structure in Univariate Settings,,
16,Structurally Sound Statistics Instruction - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Two tasks that call for the detection of structure in univariate (single variable) settings are shown in figures 1ab. Students solving the mathematical task in figure 1a must examine the underlying structure of each paint mix to discern how many different shades of green paint were made and which were the same as mixture A. Thus, the one variable that is central to this task is the shade of green paint. The solution to this task is that there are two different shades of paint: Mixtures 1, 4, and 5 are the same shade of green; mixtures 2 and 3 are a second shade. The key point here is that in this mathematical task, a different structure (ratio) indicates that a different process was used to create that paint mixture. From a mathematical perspective, any structural differences indicate different processes and resulting colors of paintnot measurement errors or slight changes in the paint-mixing process. From a statistical perspective, these differences might be data that is generated from a noisy process (e.g., slight errors while measuring and mixing paint) and are not necessarily indicative of structural differences.",,
17,Structurally Sound Statistics Instruction - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The statistical task in figure 1b embraces the noisy process view. The last digit of ones social security number is a randomly generated digit  between 0 and 9. Thus, in the long run, each digit should occur approximately the same number of times, and a graph of the last digit of peoples social security numbers should be nearly uniform in shape. However, there is inherent noise when making the last digit of social security numbers because they are randomly generated digits, so there will be slight variation from a uniform distribution, particularly in a relatively small sample. Graph 2 matches this description, and thus is the graph of the last digit of the social security numbers of 40 students. In contrast to a uniform distribution, we would expect that the distribution of a group of college students SAT scores would be approximately normal. Graph 1 fits this description: Although it does not follow a normal curve exactly (e.g., the fifth bar is taller than the sixth), the approximate structure of this graph is normal. In general, when considering the shape of a graph, a student will need to look past the bumpiness to see the underlying structure. One can do this informally by visualizing a smoother underlying curve to see what remains after smoothing out the variability (Konold and Pollatsek 2002). However, this is a challenging task for students and would need to be supported by instruction that helps students understand and learn to be comfortable with the fact that structure in statistics is often hidden below the surface.",,
18,Structurally Sound Statistics Instruction - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"From our experience using these tasks with teachers in a professional development program, we learned that they found the univariate statistical task (see fig. 1b) more challenging than the univariate mathematical one (see fig. 1a). They quickly solved and discussed the mathematical task, whereas they asked many questions and took more time to complete the statistical task. On completion, some teachers still had questions about why the distribution of social security numbers was not exactly uniform, struggling to understand why the real datas structure did not match the theoretical structure. At the end of the group discussion of these univariate tasks, Josephine, the teacher mentioned earlier, said, Structure in the math world is consistent and clear to see, whereas structure in stats is varying. Others expressed similar sentiments; hence, we feel confident that these tasks raised teachers awareness that statistical structures within univariate tasks differ from mathematical structures.",,
19,Structurally Sound Statistics Instruction - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
20,Structurally Sound Statistics Instruction - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Structure in Bivariate Settings,,
21,Structurally Sound Statistics Instruction - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Figures 2a and 2b juxtapose bivariate (two-variable) mathematical and statistical tasks. These tasks involve modeling a situation with a linear structure but do so from different perspectives. The mathematical task presented in figure 2a is solved by graphing the relationship (see fig. 3a), which is clearly linear. Upon visual inspection, the input-output relationship in the mathematical task is perfectly linear. However, whether the relationship between the two variables depicted in the statistical task (see fig. 2b) is linear is unclear upon initial inspection. The linear trend or structure is obscured by the noisy data, due to the natural, inherent variability found in such real data. However, the underlying structurethe signal in the noisy datais in fact linear, and a line can model the data. This conclusion is supported by the random scatter of points in the residual plot shown in figure 3b, showing the residuals do not have any remaining structure to them that a model should pick up.",,
22,Structurally Sound Statistics Instruction - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
23,Structurally Sound Statistics Instruction - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The fact that the points are not collinear (i.e., do not follow a linear form exactly) can lead many students to incorrectly conclude that the relationship is nonlinear (Garfield and Ben-Zvi 2008). The concept that noncollinear data can be claimed to have a linear structure can be very uncomfortable for students and can present an obstacle to their conceptualization of linear modeling in statistics (Casey 2015).",,
24,Structurally Sound Statistics Instruction - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The teachers in the workshop solved the mathematical task (see fig.2a) with little difficulty, then accurately identified some of the mathematical structure found in this task through discussion of slope, function, and equivalent ratios. Tim, a teacher attending the workshop, said, This task is great for getting my students to think about functions, specifically that for each moment in time (input), theres a specific amount of liquid in the bottom container (output). Next, the teachers worked on the height and hand span task (see fig.2b). Teachers were asked whether hand span and height data might vary, and immediately everyone affirmed that they likely do and discussed reasons for this variation. The teachers were encouraged to explore whether the two sets of data were linearly related. Nearly everyone said yes and proceeded to make informal lines of best fit like those in figure3b. Then, teachers were asked to look at the lines of their colleagues. They noticed that nobody had an identical match to his or her line of best fit. We used what teachers noticed as a way to further engage them in discussing the noisy data that caused them to suggest different lines of best fit. Tims response at the end of the day to the question What will you do differently in your classroom? echoed others sentiments: When teaching statistics, I will ask students to think about the variance in data sets and to make and revise their impressions of data (e.g., correlations and lines of best fit). A final reflection question asked the teachers to describe the difference between structure in mathematics and statistics. Their responses showed that these tasks and consequent discussion of them stimulated teachers to think differently about the nature of structure in mathematics and statistics tasks.",,
25,Structurally Sound Statistics Instruction - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,SUGGESTIONS FOR STATISTICS INSTRUCTION,,
26,Structurally Sound Statistics Instruction - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"When developing expertise in SMP 7 within statistical contexts, instruction should address recognizing the presence of noise and learning to detect the signal or structure despite the noise. Some suggested instructional activities to do so follow.",,
27,Structurally Sound Statistics Instruction - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"A useful instructional activity to help students understand the presence of noise in repeated measurements is to have each member of the class measure an attribute of an object (e.g., the circumference of the instructors head to the nearest eighth of an inch) and analyze the resulting data. Such an object inherently has one true value for that attribute but the measurements taken by the class members will not be identical to that value due to measurement variability. An instructional move for teachers is to ask students, Why didnt we all get the same measurement? The teacher can lead a class discussion of reasons that the process of collecting data resulted in noisy data (e.g., measuring tapes placed askew or errors in rounding to the nearest eighth of an inch), which is a normal phenomenon that occurs when collecting any repeated measures data. The goal of the analysis, then, is to look for the signal in the noisy datato approximate the true value of the measurement of the attribute from the data at hand.",,
28,Structurally Sound Statistics Instruction - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Another set of instructional moves to assist students in detecting the structure of shape in noisy data is asking them to (a) draw a smooth curve over a histogram or dot plot in the univariate case or (b) encircle the plotted data within a cloud in the bivariate case. These actions can help students attend to the overall shape of the distribution without being distracted by the bumpiness or variability of the data.,,
29,Structurally Sound Statistics Instruction - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"When teaching statistics, have students make a predicted graph for data, on the basis of their knowledge of the context, before graphing the actual data. Bakker and Gravemeijer (2004) found that this move is productive for fostering middle-grades students understanding of a distributions structure because it requires them to reason more globally (looking at the forest rather than the trees), and the predicted graphs are typically smoother than real data, which help students attend to their shape. Because structure in statistical data sets tends to be obscured by inherent variability, these suggested activities can help students understand the reason for such variability and learn to find the underlying structure.",,
30,Structurally Sound Statistics Instruction - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The SMP describe practices in which mathematically and statistically proficient students should become skilled. Toward that end for SMP 7, grades 68 students should experience statistics instruction that supports a focus on structure. This may seem in conflict with learning about variability, a primary objective of statistics education (Franklin et al. 2007), but this article has shown how addressing SMP 7 with statistical tasks can accomplish both.",,
