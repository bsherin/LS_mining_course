"Students are accustomed to answering a mathematics homework question in one sitting, usually in a short amount of time. If anything, the trend is toward shorter and quicker, with the rise of online mathematics packages that strive for an efficient, automated approach to presenting questions  and producing answers. By necessity, much of my mathematics curriculum is taught in an efficient manner, where time is carefully managed. I re- student is equipped with knowledge of this length relationship, a question that is quick to answer (a microwave question) is the following:  Question 1: Can a triangle exist with side lengths of 1.6 cm,  4.8 cm, and 3.1 cm?",3,mtms2012-09-76a,,
"An extended time, or slow-cooker, question is the following:  Question 2: Two sides of a triangle have lengths fixed at 6 cm and 3 cm. What are all the possible whole-number lengths for the third side? ",4,mtms2012-09-76a,,
"For the homework assignment following the Triangle Inequality theorem lesson, I give a small collection of more routine questions that are due the next day plus the extended-time question that is due in a week. Students are expected to support their answers to the extended-time question with compass constructions of all possible triangles and a paragraph explanation. They are welcome to seek help if needed.",5,mtms2012-09-76a,,

"Consider the Triangle Inequality theorem, which states that the sum of the lengths of the two shortest sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the longest side. Students first learn this relationship by using a compass and ruler to investigate cases where triangle construction succeeds and where it fails (see fig. 1). Once a ",8,mtms2012-09-76a,,

"Early in my career, I used to explicitly teach students how to solve question 2 by reducing it to a much more routine problem (since the difficulty level of any problem depends on the amount of direct instruction that prefaces it). When I moved to a new school and taught within a new curriculum, I was disappointed to see the Triangle Inequality theorem lesson followed by microwave types of questions. I sometimes give an unrehearsed, thoughtprovoking test question, so for a few years I included question 2 at the end of a test. I had been so used to student success following direct instruction that I was surprised to find that usually less than one-fourth of the students could successfully navigate the question. The majority of students generally had no clue how to solve the problem.",10,mtms2012-09-76a,,
"I was reluctant to return to more direct instruction. I felt the students were fully equipped to solve the more demanding question. Indeed, when discussing the problem after the test, only minimal prompting from me was necessary to break the question down into more manageable pieces. I would ask, “If two sides of a triangle have lengths of 6 cm and 3 cm, could the third side have a length of 2 cm?” Most students could quickly answer no, because the sum of the lengths of the two shortest sides (2 + 3) is less than the length of the longest side (6). I would then ask, “If two sides of a triangle have lengths of 6 cm and 3 cm, could the third side have a length of 8 cm?” Most students could quickly answer yes, because the sum of the lengths of the two shortest sides (6 + 3) is greater than the length of the longest side (8).",11,mtms2012-09-76a,,
"I felt the source of difficulty for students answering the problem in a short amount of time was twofold. First, many seventh graders are not ready to think abstractly about the problem, to pluck out the range of cases for the third side when two ",12,mtms2012-09-76a,,
Fig. 1 Students first learn the relationship described in the Triangle inequality theorem by using a compass and ruler to investigate cases where triangle construction succeeds or fails.,13,mtms2012-09-76a,,
"A triangle is constructed with 4 cm, 5 cm, and 8 cm sides. The 8 cm side with vertices A and B is drawn with a ruler. A compass is then used to draw a 4 cm arc centered off vertex A and a 5 cm arc centered off vertex B. The two arcs intersect to form vertex C. Vertices A and C are joined with a ruler to form the 4 cm side, and vertices B and C are joined with a ruler to form the 5 cm side.",14,mtms2012-09-76a,,
(a),15,mtms2012-09-76a,,
"A triangle construction fails with 3 cm, 4 cm, and 8 cm sides. The two arcs do not intersect to form the vertex of a triangle because the sum of the lengths of the two shortest sides is not greater than 8 cm.",16,mtms2012-09-76a,,
"(b) of the side lengths of a triangle are fixed. Second, when confronted with a mathematics problem for which the method of solution is unknown, many students freeze instead of resorting to a basic problem-solving technique like guess and check. ",17,mtms2012-09-76a,,
"My instinct was that question 2  would become generally accessible and manageable for all students by simply giving them an extended period of time to work on it, accompanied by the expectation of detailed construction and presentation of a solution. Not all problems are made accessible by the mere extension of solution time. ",18,mtms2012-09-76a,,
"Indeed, the added time can act as a source of frustration for a problem that is beyond a student’s scope. With a true slow-cooker problem, the extended solution time plays a genuine role in the accessibility of a problem.",19,mtms2012-09-76a,,

"For several years now, I have been giving students a week to construct a project-quality solution to question 2. The extended time has made all the difference in the accessibility of the problem. Compass construction of the triangles over the course of a week ",21,mtms2012-09-76a,,
"Fig. 3 in his solution to the Triangle inequality question, Aaron explains that when the third side length is too long or too short, the three sides will not be able to connect to form a triangle.",22,mtms2012-09-76a,,
"Fig. 2 These five constructions are possible for the extended-time Triangle inequality question in which two sides have fixed lengths of 6 cm and 3 cm. Note that 3 cm and 9 cm are impossible lengths for the third side, since the vertex C would lie on AB and the result would be a line segment instead of a triangle.",23,mtms2012-09-76a,,
"(a) 4 cm (b) 5 cm (c) 6 cm (d) 7 cm (e) 8 cm draws students into concrete exploration of all possible cases, allowing them to explicitly discover all the whole-number lengths that work for the third side (see fig. 2). Students then form their own understanding and explanation for the range of possible lengths. ",24,mtms2012-09-76a,,
"For example, Aaron recognizes that when the third side length is too long or too short, the three sides will be unable to connect to form a triangle (see fig. 3). He illustrates his conclusion with sketches and points out the critical cases where the triangle turns into a line. Justin goes one step further with his explanation (see fig. 4). He writes inequalities to show that the length of the third side must be less than the sum of the lengths of the two other sides and greater than the difference in the lengths of the two other sides.",25,mtms2012-09-76a,,
"Some students describe in words, rather than a formula, the role of the sum and difference of the other sides’ lengths. Some students produce a beautiful and insightful portrayal of all possible triangles in a single diagram, as shown in Leo’s illustration (see  fig. 5). Having extended time to construct and explain their solution allows students to own the concept and to frame their understanding uniquely.",26,mtms2012-09-76a,,
"Typically, over 90 percent of the  students correctly determine all possible whole-number lengths for the triangle’s third side. Even the incorrect answers usually show reasonable constructions and a general grasp of the problem. Some students have small errors in their compass constructions, leading them to incorrectly conclude that 3 cm or 9 cm are allowable lengths for the third side. ",27,mtms2012-09-76a,,
"Some students stop short and construct only half of the allowable triangles, finding either the shorter or longer of the allowable lengths for the third side. Some students leave out the 6 cm solution, thinking that the third side cannot have a length equal to either of the other sides. Students are allowed to seek help from others or me with extended-time problems. When students see me to work on the Triangle Inequality problem, they usually need little more than my acknowledgment of their successes  as they proceed with the various constructions.",28,mtms2012-09-76a,,

"A slow-cooker homework question can be formulated by the teacher and given to students any time that a teacher wants to back away from the sometimes relentlessly efficient routine of nightly homework questions due the next day, to provide students a chance to construct an answer with more persistence, thoughtfulness, and thoroughness. Although many advocate for the increased speed, power, and flexibility afforded by technology, some express concern about an accompanying trend away from thinking with patience and depth (e.g., Carr 2010).",30,mtms2012-09-76a,,
"As some computerized learning  programs steer mathematics education toward greater speed and efficiency, we encourage teachers to value extended-time questions as an opportunity for students to think more deeply about mathematics problems. Indeed, a commitment toward more patient investigation is a mindset that can be nurtured both with and without the use of technology. Used appropriately, diverse technological tools such as graphing calculators, dynamically linked geometry or algebra software programs, or various mathematics applets can play the same role as the compass in our slow-cooker ques-",31,mtms2012-09-76a,,
