3,CCSSM Challenge: Graphing Ratio and Proportion,"A Cherry Syrup problem can help build links between ratio and graphing.  aA renewed emphasis was placed on  ratio and proportional reasoning in the middle grades in the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSM). Although NCTM’s Principles and Standards for School Mathematics emphasized the learning of ratio and proportion in its 2000 publication, CCSSM goes a step deeper and underscores the importance of real-world contexts, as well as the development of an understanding of the connection among proportions, ratios, and graphs. “Analyze proportional relationships and use them to solve real-world and mathematical problems” (CCSSI 2010, p. 47) begins the CCSSM’s grade 7  overview about ratio and proportional relationships. Within that broad statement, students are asked to “compute unit rates associated with ratios of fractions, . . . recognize and represent proportional relationships between quantities, . . . decide whether two quantities are in a proportional relationship, . . .” and “identify the constant of proportionality.” Students are also asked to “represent proportional relationships by equations” and “explain what a point (x, y) on the graph of a proportional relationship means in terms of the situation” (CCSSI 2010, p. 48).

D’Ambrosio, Kathleen Lynch-Davis, Alexia Mintos, and Kathryn Krawczyk outlined by Lobato and Ellis (2010) as they described the essential understandings involved in reasoning with ratios and proportions. Further elaboration was provided by the Common Core Standards writing team in the progressions document (The Common Core Standards Writing Team 2011). The expectation for students includes the ability to not only compute and then compare and interpret the results of computations in context but also interpret ratios and proportions as they are represented in graphs. This expectation presents a significant challenge for middlegrades teachers as they consider how  to develop these abilities in students. ",6,CCSSM Challenge: Graphing Ratio and Proportion
7,CCSSM Challenge: Graphing Ratio and Proportion,"Since 2007, we have  investigated links among  ratios, proportions, and graphs to gain insights into the challenges that students face as they build connections between ratios and  linear functions. Teachers have shared with us ways that they analyze student work. They thoughtfully consider student reasoning and how it might be used to develop relationships between ratios and  graphs. In this article, we illustrate the challenges that teachers face in linking an understanding of ratios and graphs by exploring student work from a ratio comparison problem (see fi g. 1), highlighting the understandings that are needed to create graphs from such problems, and discussing teachers’ insights drawn from examining graphs developed from a ratio comparison problem. We provide suggestions for teachers as they strive to meet the challenges outlined in CCSSM, that middle-grades students develop a fl exible understanding of ratios and proportions, including the ability to apply this reasoning to create graphs, interpret graphs, and relate interpretations to the context of the problem.  coMPUtation and conteXt",7,CCSSM Challenge: Graphing Ratio and Proportion
8,CCSSM Challenge: Graphing Ratio and Proportion,The Cherry Syrup problem in fi gure 1 was included on the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) (Brown and Clark 2006) and was classifi ed by NAEP as assessing procedural knowledge. Learners’ work on this item has revealed that many students do not approach the problem procedurally as intended and face challenges when using ratios and interpreting the results of their computations.,8,CCSSM Challenge: Graphing Ratio and Proportion
9,CCSSM Challenge: Graphing Ratio and Proportion,"We selected this item to illuminate the challenges that students in grade 8 and beyond face as they work to make  sense of ratios. The student work associated with this question encouraged us to explore how middlegrades students might approach the task. Even students with more mathematical experiences have diffi culty employing a middle school−level understanding of ratio and proportion. Students from grades 5 through 12, whose work we have collected, used a variety of computational strategies to compare the strengths of the cherry drinks.",9,CCSSM Challenge: Graphing Ratio and Proportion
10,CCSSM Challenge: Graphing Ratio and Proportion,"Computing a unit ratio by dividing syrup and water was one such strategy. For example, students divided the quantities of syrup by quantities of water to fi nd that Luis has 0.113 and Martin has 0.119 (see fi g. 2a). Units were generally not provided in student responses, as might be expected on a standardized test. Other students divided the quantity of water by syrup and found that Luis has 8.83 and Martin has 8.4 (see fi g. 2b). Some students reasoned correctly with these numbers. For example, Martin must have the stronger cherry fl avor drink because for 1 ounce of syrup, he only has 8.4 ounces of water. Others simply selected the larger number that resulted from the computations and concluded that Luis’s drink is stronger. ",10,CCSSM Challenge: Graphing Ratio and Proportion

23,CCSSM Challenge: Graphing Ratio and Proportion,"Students must reason that with zero ounces of cherry syrup, there will be zero ounces of water because this is not a mixture. Understanding that (0, 0) is an appropriate point on each line may not be intuitive. The issue that (0, 0) is the starting point for each mixture may seem counterintuitive to some because of the different concentrations.",23,CCSSM Challenge: Graphing Ratio and Proportion
24,CCSSM Challenge: Graphing Ratio and Proportion,"Some students generate other  points using intuitive knowledge of equivalent ratios. Doubling, tripling, or halving both quantities of syrup and water can produce mixtures of the same strength and provide additional points that lie on the same line. Although intuitively this manipulation of quantities may make sense to students, ",24,CCSSM Challenge: Graphing Ratio and Proportion
25,CCSSM Challenge: Graphing Ratio and Proportion,"These obstacles are further discussed in research on the use of graphs by professionals (Roth and Bowen 2001) and students (Friel, Curcio, and Bright 2001). Teachers can build instruction more effectively when they understand the diffi culties that students must overcome to make these decisions and successfully graph the information in the problem.",25,CCSSM Challenge: Graphing Ratio and Proportion
26,CCSSM Challenge: Graphing Ratio and Proportion,"1. Deciding What Points to Graph While working on the Cherry Syrup problem, some students struggle to generate ordered pairs to graph. A table of values is not given in the statement of the problem. The problem refers to two separate mixtures; successful students must realize that they will graph two separate lines. After initially inspecting the problem, there appear to be only two points, one deduced from each different Cherry Syrup mixture. Students who remember that two points are needed to graph a line may only graph one line using the single given values from each of the two mixtures. These students are not paying attention to the two different mixtures. ",26,CCSSM Challenge: Graphing Ratio and Proportion
27,CCSSM Challenge: Graphing Ratio and Proportion,"Students should realize that two lines must be graphed to make judgments about the strength of the mixtures. Therefore, they have to determine an additional point or coordinate pair for each mixture line.  it is more difficult to realize that equivalent ratios will all constitute points that lie on a same line. Students can have difficulty associating the numerical manipulations of the ratios with movements on the graph.",27,CCSSM Challenge: Graphing Ratio and Proportion

29,CCSSM Challenge: Graphing Ratio and Proportion,"To build a graph from the information in the Cherry Syrup problem, students must identify the quantities to be graphed and define the axes. They are sometimes unsure whether they should graph the cherry syrup, graph the water, or graph the entire mixture. Some students focus on graphing syrup and water, whereas others graph syrup or water and the mixture.",29,CCSSM Challenge: Graphing Ratio and Proportion
30,CCSSM Challenge: Graphing Ratio and Proportion,"After they decide what to graph, they can have difficulty defining the axes. In addition to the typical challenge of determining an increment for each axis, students must decide which quantity goes on the x-axis and which goes on the y-axis. Some of the thought processes behind these choices constitute students’ emergent graph sense (Friel, Curcio, and Bright 2001). The realization that in this case the choice of axes is arbitrary should be a point of classroom discussion.",30,CCSSM Challenge: Graphing Ratio and Proportion
31,CCSSM Challenge: Graphing Ratio and Proportion,3. Making Sense of the Graphs,31,CCSSM Challenge: Graphing Ratio and Proportion
32,CCSSM Challenge: Graphing Ratio and Proportion,"Once the graphs have been constructed, students must use the lines to draw inferences. Exploring how the two lines provide information about the strength of the cherry syrup mixture is a next step. Some students revert to the numerical manipulation and make sense of the graphs that way. Others try to find a common point on the graph and make sense of the concentration by comparing the y-coordinates when the x-coordinate is the same. Although adults might compare slopes to draw conclusions about the strengths of the drinks, students may not interpret the concentration by looking at the slopes of the lines. Asking students to share  and discuss how comparisons can be made with the lines provides another opportunity for understanding.  teacheRs’ eXPloRations  oF gRaPhs",32,CCSSM Challenge: Graphing Ratio and Proportion
33,CCSSM Challenge: Graphing Ratio and Proportion,"Students’ decisions about how to graph the information from the problem will impact the representations they generate and their reasoning. In our discussions with teachers, we use graphs of the Cherry Syrup problem produced by learners to consider what the teachers notice and have questions about and how they anticipate the graphs that might be used by the learners to solve the problem. Specifically, we share learner-generated graphs with the teachers and ask them to solve the problem using the graphs. The teachers’ approaches to the use of graphs highlight the challenges faced in meeting the demands of CCSSM standards.",33,CCSSM Challenge: Graphing Ratio and Proportion
34,CCSSM Challenge: Graphing Ratio and Proportion,"Several difficulties surfaced when  teachers were faced with deciding how to use the graphs to compare mixtures (see fig. 3). One teacher suggested using a vertical line on the graph in figure 3a to help in reasoning about and in comparing the mixtures. In particular, she commented that if the quantity of the mixture (such as 60 oz.) is picked, then clearly the quantity of syrup in Martin’s mixture is a higher number than in Luis’s mixture. More syrup for the same total implies a stronger mixture for Martin.",34,CCSSM Challenge: Graphing Ratio and Proportion
35,CCSSM Challenge: Graphing Ratio and Proportion,"Using a horizontal line to interpret  the relationships between syrup and total mixture was also suggested. For example, a horizontal line at 9 ounces of syrup shows that the total mixture for Martin is less than the total mixture for Luis, meaning that Luis’s mixture has more water for the same amount of syrup as Martin’s; therefore, Martin’s mixture is stronger. With both methods, the analysis did not require exact values; hence, there was no need to   calculate the quantity of mixture or syrup. Instead, the comparison was made with the relative size of the values, and the graphs supported the comparison. This particular graph (see fig. 3a)   presented difficulties for some teachers who did not believe that the graph of syrup to total quantity would provide a valid representation of the mixtures. Interestingly enough, this same difficulty did not arise when one teacher suggested setting up proportions of syrup to total mixture. Teachers were comfortable with an equivalent fraction representation in which the denominators were the total mixture. However, the graph of the same data was problematic for some, suggesting that teachers are not connecting these representations. Some teachers argued that a graph of syrup and water would be more valuable, so we turn our attention to such graphs below.",35,CCSSM Challenge: Graphing Ratio and Proportion
36,CCSSM Challenge: Graphing Ratio and Proportion,"Some teachers spent a lot of time discussing which quantity was the dependent variable and which was the independent variable in this representation (see fig. 3b). They also questioned which quantity should be plotted on the x-axis. In mathematics problems, the choice of independent variable and axis representing that variable is often predetermined or based on conventions with which students may be unfamiliar. For example, students are asked to make graphs when tables of data are provided or encouraged to plot the height a ball bounces, given the drop height. Gaining insight into the need for conventions or the complexity of making decisions about which variable to plot on the x-axis is key, as the teachers’ discussion suggested. Attention to graphing and interpreting different representations of the same situation when such choices are arbitrary (such as in this context or the context of exchange of foreign currency) is critical in building skill at reading and interpreting one’s own graphs and those of others. ",36,CCSSM Challenge: Graphing Ratio and Proportion
37,CCSSM Challenge: Graphing Ratio and Proportion,"With figure 3b, some discussion occurred about the slope of the two lines and how the slope would indicate the “strength” of the mixtures. Teachers generally agreed that “greater slope means stronger mixture,” although hesitation was evident when unpacking why. Comments about the meaning of the slope being “rise over run” and translating this information to the context of the mixture generated some important insights into the relationship of the ratios of syrup to mixture and how they translate to the graphs. Again, it was apparent that no calculation was needed to determine which line had a greater slope. The visual study of the graphs provided all the information needed to make sense of which mixture was stronger.",37,CCSSM Challenge: Graphing Ratio and Proportion
38,CCSSM Challenge: Graphing Ratio and Proportion,"In comparing the graphs in   figures 3b and 3c, we find that the numbers given in the problem were labeled in figure 3b. In figure 3c, the given numbers were not apparent, and instead the learner used the graph to determine the approximate amount of syrup for 30 ounces of water. Unfortunately, some inaccuracies in figure 3c led many teachers to dismiss the representation altogether; a rich discussion might have occurred if a careful analysis of the student’s work had followed, in spite of the graphing errors. The many pairs of dots marked by the student in figure 3c seem to indicate an attempt to use the same “horizontal line” method described by our teachers in analyzing figure 3a. Yet the student seems to have settled on using the “vertical line” method instead, given the approximate values recorded for 30 ounces of water. Approximate quantities of syrup could easily be read from the graph, allowing for a relative comparison.",38,CCSSM Challenge: Graphing Ratio and Proportion

41,CCSSM Challenge: Graphing Ratio and Proportion,Fig. 3 Several difficulties were revealed when teachers had to decide how to use the graphs to compare the mixtures.

44,CCSSM Challenge: Graphing Ratio and Proportion,"students build an understanding of ratios beyond computation. In particular, using a graphical representation allows for several different methods of comparison including horizontal and vertical comparisons that do not rely on computational accuracy. Additionally, explorations of graphical representations can be used to investigate decisions and conventions involved in graphing, such as what quantities might be represented on the x-axis. The graphs themselves also allow for the introduction or exploration of slopes of lines. Teachers’ discussions of the cherry syrup graphs, however, illustrate the challenges they face in linking proportional reasoning and graphing.",44,CCSSM Challenge: Graphing Ratio and Proportion
45,CCSSM Challenge: Graphing Ratio and Proportion,"A series of questions can be used to build from the students’ methods of comparison toward an understanding of slope. Which line is “steeper?” What does it mean for one line to be steeper than another? Can we generate a measure of steepness that is meaningful in this context? Having had such a discussion would allow students to investigate the art of graphing as well as ideas about slope. Imagine graphing and comparing a mixture of 4 ounces of syrup and 10 ounces of water to one with 5 ounces of syrup and 15 ounces of water. In this comparison, the unit ratio is easy to find and see on a graph, as are other ratios, such as 10/25 and 10/30. Such an investigation allows students to focus on understanding slope and how it is interpreted in the context of the problem, without the distraction of complex computations. Using this approach, the challenge is shifted from computation to building meaning for the slope in the context of the problem.",45,CCSSM Challenge: Graphing Ratio and Proportion
46,CCSSM Challenge: Graphing Ratio and Proportion,"As teachers face the demands of CCSSM, they will explore the constraints and possibilities provided by students’ strategies and understandings. The promise of CCSSM lies in teachers’ power to build from students’  approaches to problems toward more complex ways of reasoning. As we have seen in the Cherry Syrup problem, building representations of situations using graphs affords students new insights into ratio comparisons including understandings of slope and the meaning of slope in context. The teachers we have worked with have been excited by the opportunity to use the graphs for reasoning and discussion. They have also been intrigued by the possibilities this approach elicits as they work to build connections between mathematics content. ",46,CCSSM Challenge: Graphing Ratio and Proportion
