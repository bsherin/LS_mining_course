V an  de  Walle  (2007)  describes  dividing  one  fraction  by  another  in  this  way: “invert  the  divisor  and  multiply  is  probably one of the most mysterious rules in elementary mathematics” (p. 326). Tirosh (2000) concurs  and  cites  research  suggesting  that  “division  of fractions is often considered the most mechanical and least  understood  topic  in  elementary  school”  (p.  6) and that students’ performance on tasks involving division of fractions is typically very poor. These claims are reflected in the difficulties that college students experience in courses for mathematics for elementary teachers when they try to explain why the invert-andmultiply algorithm works. see the following problem.  a  new  machine  can  polish  1/2  of  the  floors  in 3/4 of an hour.

"One goal in our mathematics courses for elementary teachers is for students to develop a conceptual understanding  of  the  standard  algorithms  for  adding,  subtracting,  multiplying,  and  dividing  whole numbers, fractions, and decimals. These courses are taught using an “inquiry approach.” class sessions are  devoted  to  small-group  work  on  challenging tasks intended to promote mathematical discussion among  peers,  followed  by  whole-class  discussions of students’ thinking about the tasks. Our role as instructors is to guide these discussions by introducing conventional terminology, symbols, and notation by posing “What if?” questions and counterexamples; by asking students to think about what they have done, about how others have done it, and about how they could have done it differently; and by asking them to consider why what they have done has or has not worked. With regard to helping students understand division of fractions, the challenge has been to develop sequences of activities that will help students (a) appropriately interpret situations that could involve division of fractions, and (b) make sense of algorithmic procedures for dividing fractions.",7,mtms2007-05-490a,,

The first set of problems that we present in the serving-size context is shown in figure 1. We explain in problem 2, for instance, that students should express any leftover cookies in terms of the fraction of a serving that they comprise. students usually do not find this task to be too difficult for problems such as 2, but it becomes decidedly more challenging in problems such as 6 and 7. a typical solution for problem 6 is shown in  �������� 1 serving 1/2 serving ��������� =1 ����� ����� ����� ����� vOl. 12, nO. 9  .

The dilemma is how to express the leftover amount.  Many  students  initially  say  the  answer  is  6 1/2, which almost always leads to a rich discussion about the units to which the 6 and the 1/2 refer (cf. Perlwitz 2005). it is incorrect to say 6 1/2 servings, but many students struggle initially with viewing the two leftover pieces as 2/3 of a serving.",13,mtms2007-05-490a,,

"serving consists of 3 things of a certain size, and we have 7 things of that same certain size, so how many servings can we make? at this point, we have not discussed with students that these items may be viewed as division problems, so we present one more page of problems without illustrations. The first five problems on this page are the following: 1.  a serving size is 6 cookies. How many servings  can i make from 30 cookies? 2.  a serving size is 7 cookies. How many servings  can i make from 30 cookies? 3.  a serving size is 1/2 cookie. How many servings  can i make from 30 cookies? 4.  a serving size is 1/4 cookie. How many servings  can i make from 30 cookies? 5.  a serving size is 1/2 cookie. How many servings  can i make from 3/4 cookie? after discussing students’ solutions to these problems, we ask, “How can we view these problems as division problems? can you write a division number sentence for each of these problems?” students have little difficulty writing the number sentences 30 ÷ 6 and 30 ÷ 7, respectively, for the first two problems. For problem 3, many students figure out that the answer is 60 and many write the number sentence 30 ÷ 1/2, but some students think 30 ÷ 1/2 should be 15. at this point, we discuss  the  measurement  interpretation  of  division: How many 7s are in 30? How many 1/2s are in 30? (as opposed to how many 2s are in 30?) and so on. students are then able to interpret problem 5 as being 3/4 ÷ 1/2, or how many 1/2s are in 3/4? We also discuss the idea that the question asked in problem 5 is exactly the same as that asked in problem 1. The only difference is the size of a serving and the amount of cookies we have from which to make servings.",19,mtms2007-05-490a,,
Tim devised the following method for figuring out the “How many servings?” problems.,20,mtms2007-05-490a,,
���������,21,mtms2007-05-490a,,
"Tim said: To figure out a problem like My serving size is 1/3 cookie. How many servings can I make from 3/4 cookie? you can first figure out a common denominator for these numbers. by making the 1/3 = 4/12 and the 3/4 = 9/12, the problem is much easier to solve. From the 9/12 i can get 2 whole servings of 4/12 and have 1/12 leftover. The 1/12 that is leftover is 1/4 of a serving, so my answer is 2 1/4. This works with all division with fraction problems.",22,mtms2007-05-490a,,

"Fig. 5  Tim’s method next we return to a discussion of the units associated with the answer to a problem such as 3/4 ÷ 1/2. students have little difficulty with the cookie/serving-size context since they have previously used diagrams (as shown in fig. 4) to solve such problems. but  what  about  the  number  sentence  3/4  ÷  1/2  =  1 1/2? To what does the 1 1/2 refer? The students’ drawings and the measurement interpretation of division are helpful when exploring this issue. if the question is “How many 1/2s are in 3/4?” then the answer, 1 1/2, must mean that there are one and a half 1/2s in 3/4. Figure 4 illustrates this solution if we replace “1 serving” by “1/2 serving.” We discuss with our preservice teachers the subtle yet significant challenge that students face in making sense of 3/4 ÷ 1/2 = 1 1/2 in a measurement context: The dividend and the divisor refer to the same-sized unit (e.g., 3/4 of a cookie, 1/2 of a cookie), but the quotient  refers  to  a  unit  that  is  the  size  of  the  divisor  (e.g., 1 1/2 half cookies).",25,mtms2007-05-490a,,
We  are  ready  to  move  toward  the  common- denominator  algorithm  for  dividing  fractions  and present the problems shown in figure  5. Tim is a pseudonym  for  an  eighth-grade  student  who  constructed this method as he participated in a series of lessons taught by one of the authors. We extend Tim’s strategy notationally by writing the following: × = = ÷ = 12 12 = ÷ = 9 4 2,26,mtms2007-05-490a,,
"We relate this to the previously discussed idea that if both the serving size and the given amount are expressed in the same-sized pieces, then the denominator is irrelevant. One must focus on the number of pieces in the serving size and the given amount (i.e.,  = = + 88 ÷ =   × ÷ =  × = 11 vOl. 12, nO. 9  .  May 2007   493  × = × 2/3 the numerator). We also relate the process of getting a common denominator in this algorithm to the need, when solving the problem pictorially, to cut the representations of both the dividend and the divisor into pieces that are the same size (see fig. 4). note that this algorithm is essentially the same as that invented by a seventh grader whom Perlwitz (2004) interviewed. in fact, in many of our classes, the “Tim’s Method” page (see fig. 5) is not needed because several students have already invented a comparable strategy by the time we reach this point in the sequence.",27,mtms2007-05-490a,,

We want to divide 3/4 of a cake equally among 2/3 of a group. What does that mean?

What would be an appropriate division number sentence for problem 3 above?
