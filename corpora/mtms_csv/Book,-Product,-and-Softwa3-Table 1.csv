3,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","With the Common Core in the forefront of so many educational debates, Christopher Danielson provides both parents and educators alike with a concise resource that clearly helps the reader navigate the twists and turns of the math standards, from kindergarten through the high school years. As with other For Dummies books, this text can be read cover to cover or a specific chapter of interest can be turned to with little loss of previously introduced information.",,
4,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","From a parents point of view, Danielsons book gives a concise introduction to what the math standards are and what they are not in easy-to-understand language, without a lot of unnecessary educational jargon. Easy-to-recognize icons alert parents to what to look for in their childs work, summaries of the important points in each section, and Try This activities to help foster acquisition of needed concepts. Websites for further areas of study, resources for homework help, and a series of related videos are included throughout the book as well as in a chapter titled Ten Awesome Resources for Parents.",,
5,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","The major content summaries presented for each grade level are informative to parents and serve as a useful guide to teachers, who need to understand what concepts are introduced at which previous grade level and how these concepts continue to develop in the forthcoming grades. This book is much less daunting to digest than the actual Common Core State Standards for Mathematics and provides valuable insights into how the standards are learned that are not in the actual document. Any conversation about the Common Core, among parents, teachers, and/or educational decision makers, should begin with the reading of this book.",,

11,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","The Handbook on the History of Mathematics Education, edited by Alexander Karp and Gert Schubring, offers 29 chapters and over 600 pages of facts, anecdotes, and commentaries about mathematics teaching and learning over the past two millennia. The book is full of interesting tidbits and insights, such as evidence that Islamic societies during the seventh and eighth centuries held discussion circles in private houses, where people of different backgrounds came together to ponder particular mathematical problems (p. 86)early Math Circles! Perhaps of most interest to teachers of middle-grades mathematics will be the chapters History of Teaching Arithmetic, Notes for a History of Teaching Algebra, and Mathematics Teaching Practices.",,
12,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","I was fascinated to learn, for instance, that in a 1732 book about arithmetic, German mathematician Christlieb Clausberg expressed that calculation procedures are traditions that may be bended, not mathematical laws, for example, multiplying a number by units, tens, and hundreds, may be done in any order . . . multiplying by 75 can be done more easily by multiplying by 100 and subtracting one fourth (p. 439). This sort of flexible thinking with number and arithmetic remind me of the Number Talks common in many classrooms today.",,
13,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","In examining the history of teaching practices, one learns that eighteenth- and nineteenth-century classrooms were often decentralized in organization, with groups of students working on different problems and subjects (p. 537). The authors argue that what was a common teacher-directed pedagogy of the twentieth century was not historically the norm prior to that. The instructional shifts we are exploring todaymore student-directed learning and more learning through collaborative problem solvingmay in some ways be reactivating past modes of learning mathematics.",,
14,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Although perhaps not giving ideas for immediate classroom use, this books historical perspectives do provide the sense that our work to promote reasoning and sense making among learners of mathematics is not new and is worthy of our continued efforts.",,

20,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","The Math Myth garnered much attention when an op-ed piece by the author in the New York Times questioned current mathematics requirements. Hacker, who has been a mathematics professor, calls for adult arithmetic or numeracy to be taught at a demanding level to give all citizens the skills necessary to function in a civilization that would collapse without mathematics. The op-ed piece was titled, Is Algebra Necessary, although Hacker contends that basic algebra is definitely necessary for everyone. The piece elicited quantities of discussion, huge sales of the book, and much debate about the mathematics required for the United States to be globally competitive.",,
21,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Hacker cites myriad studies showing that academic mathematics requirements pose a harsh and senseless hurdle and notes that current STEM initiatives, although backed by powerful entities, have, like all myths, started with a modicum of truth and are already taking a heavy toll on this country, most markedly on the humane spirit that has made America exciting and unique. Hacker offers options and alternatives, which he contends do not dumb down curricula or offer a subordinate track, but, rather, focus on the use of numeracy and valid statistical analysis to empower humanity. He does not want to denigrate STEM pursuits but suggests inclusion of PATH (Philosophy, Art, Theology, and History), as well.",,
22,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","The book offers food for thought for a wide variety of readers from college mathematics professors to John Q. Public. This book, an easy read, has been reviewed by notable educational authorities and is worthy of in-depth reading and contemplation.",,

28,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","I would imagine that everyone who has read Carol Dwecks work on mindsets immediately thought of the damage that a fixed mindset can have in the field of mathematics. It therefore makes perfect sense to devote an entire book to mathematical mindsets. In addition, because of her background and her ability to share her expertise, Jo Boaler was the perfect choice to convey this information. This book lays out a comprehensive approach to the teaching and learning of mathematics and is meant to reach a wide audience, including both educators and parents.",,
29,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","The book begins with a short overview of brain research that lays the foundation for the remainder of the chapters. The next few inspiring chapters focus on the importance of making mistakes and struggling through problems, along with focusing on the inherent beauty in mathematics. The remainder of the book presents strategies on how best to prepare all students to be successful in the field of mathematics. Several sections, including parts of the appendix, provide guidance on the benefits of rich, mathematical tasks. Examples are given that show what these tasks look like and how they can be developed.",,
30,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Another major focus in Mathematical Mindsets is making mathematics education more equitable. The sections on grouping and assessment strategies provide a variety of approaches and ways of thinking about these topics that should make educators rethink how they approach these matters. Throughout the entire book, detailed examples of research-based strategies are provided to support the ideas presented in each of the chapters.",,
31,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","This book is an essential read for all levels of educators in the field of mathematics. I would recommend it for use in preservice programs, professional development sessions for seasoned teachers, and for parents who want their children to be curious about and love mathematics. I found this book to be very inspiring and at times overwhelming in its scope, but it is a resource I plan to keep out on my desk to refer to continually for ideas and motivation.",,

37,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Teaching Mathematics Using Popular Culture: Strategies for Common Core Instruction from Film and Television by Elana Reiser is an amazingly detailed collection of math references found in popular media. The books preface says it is intended for two audiences, teachers who are interested in alternative methods of teaching and teachers who wish to incorporate technology into their classroom. The author then explains how the book could be essential for college professors, preservice math teachers, parents who want to introduce math outside the classroom, parents of home-schooled students, and libraries.",,
38,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","The book starts by discussing the uses of video in the classroom and shares a selection of research that supports this use. A brief outline of the history and structure of the Common Core standards follows. The cataloged media, which comprise the majority of the text, are grouped by the Common Cores high school math domains. It is unfortunate that the classroom tasks were not coded to individual standards as this coding could help guide teachers in their usage. Some media examples and tasks were challenging to align to specific standards.",,
39,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Some media examples were quick references to or jokes about mathematics that are used to show that math is relevant. Some examples were actual problems that students could be challenged to solve. The suggested classroom activities were often teacher directed, but tasks could easily be adjusted to be more student led. Overall, teachers may benefit from the authors work collecting and meticulously cataloging media sources.",,
