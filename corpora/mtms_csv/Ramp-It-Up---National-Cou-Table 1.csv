0,Ramp It Up - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Ramps are inclined surfaces that allow people handling wheeled objects (wheelchairs, carts, strollers, and so on) an easier access to a path or a building. A ramp’s slope refers to its steepness. The slope is the ratio of the vertical distance between the ramp’s lowest and highest points (the rise) to the horizontal distance from one end of the ramp to the other (the run), measured on the line perpendicular to the rise. It can also be displayed as:",,

2,Ramp It Up - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) specifies that any path with a slope greater than 1:20 should be considered a ramp. The ADA accessibility guidelines require that in general the smallest possible slope should be used for any ramp. Ramp slopes of 1:16 to 1:20 are preferable, and no ramp should have a slope greater than 1:12. In addition, as the difficulty in using an incline depends both on its slope and on its length, the maximum rise for any run is 30 inches. Use this information to solve the following problems:",,
3,Ramp It Up - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"1. You must build a ramp with a rise of 15 inches to roll some lab equipment into your school. If you follow the ADA specifications, what is the horizontal length (the “run”) of the shortest ramp you can build? What is the ramp’s total length?",,
4,Ramp It Up - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"2. You find out that the equipment is very heavy, so you decide to use an incline that is less steep with a ratio of 1:16. How long will the ramp be?",,
5,Ramp It Up - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,3. What is the length of the shortest ramp for the maximum ADA acceptable rise of 30 inches?,,
6,Ramp It Up - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,4. A warehouse uses ramps that are 10 feet long to load its forklifts onto flat bed trucks for hauling.,,
7,Ramp It Up - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"a. If the bed of the truck is 2 1/2 feet above the ground, and the ramp is secured to the end of the truck, what is the slope of the ramp?",,
8,Ramp It Up - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,b. Would this slope be acceptable for a wheelchair?,,
9,Ramp It Up - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,c. How long should the ramp be to be ADA compliant?,,

12,Ramp It Up - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"6. Find the slope of ramps at your school or in buildings in your neighborhood. Are they ADA compliant? If they are not, what modifications could be made so that they become ADA compliant?",,
13,Ramp It Up - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,7. Interview an architect or urban planner and ask the following: What are the slopes of ramps that he or she uses most often and under which conditions? What other constraints does he or she need to keep in mind when building an access ramp?,,
