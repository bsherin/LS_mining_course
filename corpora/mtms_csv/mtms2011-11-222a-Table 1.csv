They were also familiar with the concepts of divisibility and prime factorization as well as the rules of divisibility. On the classroom wall an 8 ft. × 10 ft. grid listed the prime factorizations of the counting numbers from 1 to 60 (see fig. 1). This chart was developed in a previous class period using the Building Numbers from Primes activity described by Burkhart (2009).

"After the students worked through an example problem with the teacher, they individually explored possible solutions to each of the questions. As the questions began to involve more types of fruit, it was necessary for each group of students to create a key to indicate which Popsicle-stick color represented each fruit. ",31,mtms2011-11-222a,,
"Students employed a variety of  solution strategies. Almost all groups used the Popsicle sticks to help find a solution. A few of the advanced students understood that they were using the greatest common factor of the given numbers to determine the number of baskets. Since they were already familiar with the vocabulary, the students easily solved the problems using their prior knowledge of GCF. Other students had to sort the Popsicle sticks to solve each problem.

"Students separated the Popsicle sticks into stacks of fruit, with the smallest number of fruit in one stack. The stacks that did not contain the same number of Popsicle sticks as  the others were redistributed. For instance, in solving question 3 on  the activity sheet (20 apples and  15 oranges), fifteen stacks were initially created, with each stack containing  1 orange (see fig. 2a). The 20 apples  were then distributed among the fi fteen stacks. Since fi ve stacks had 1 orange and 2 apples and ten stacks had 1 orange and 1 apple, the ten stacks of 1 orange and 1 apple were redistributed among the fi ve stacks, which resulted in each stack having 4 apples and 3 oranges (see fi g. 2b). Thus, a total of 5 baskets were created, with each basket having 4 apples and 3 oranges. Of the fi ve stacks of Popsicle sticks, each stack contained 4 red Popsicle sticks (apples) and 3 purple Popsicle sticks (oranges).",33,mtms2011-11-222a,,
"Another solution strategy used by groups of students was to break up the same color of Popsicle sticks into equal groups and then compare the number of different-color stacks to determine how to form the baskets of fruit.

"three stacks with 3 oranges in each (see fi g. 3a). Since there were at least three stacks of each color (apples and oranges), three stacks were created that used all the stacks of oranges and three of the stacks of apples. The remaining stack of 3 apples was then distributed to those newly formed stacks (see fi g. 3b). Thus, three fruit baskets were formed; each basket contained 4 apples and 3 oranges. The most diffi cult question for  students to solve was probably question 4 (7 apples and 13 oranges), since it required that only one basket be made. Many of the groups questioned whether the problem could be solved. However, with some questioning by the teacher, the students eventually  recognized that 7 and 13 are prime numbers so they could not be divided into groups with equal numbers. In stating a solution, one student responded, “Because we can’t split up the apples and oranges equally, we have to put them all into one basket.” Although this question consisted of two prime numbers, the students could have been given a question with relatively prime numbers, such as 7 apples and 4 oranges or 9 apples and 4 oranges, to get a solution of one basket. In question 12, students observed that all three numbers (4, 8, and 17) have no common factor even though 4 and 8 have a greatest common factor of 4. The solution is thus one basket for the three different types of fruit.",46,mtms2011-11-222a,,

"Occasionally, students separated the fruit into stacks using a common factor, but not the greatest common factor. For example, in question 1 (16 apples and 8 oranges), a group of students produced four baskets; each basket contained 4 apples and 2 oranges. In this case, the students identifi ed a common factor but not the greatest common factor.",50,mtms2011-11-222a,,
"Although the students might have  misunderstood the instructions for fi nding the most baskets, it provided a good teachable moment because 4 and 2 have a common factor. A different arrangement could be made to create more baskets. It was also a good opportunity to help students understand the distinction between common factors and the greatest common factor without having introduced this vocabulary. ",51,mtms2011-11-222a,,
"To distinguish between these two concepts, the prime factorization chart on the classroom wall was used to compare factors of the given numbers. For instance, when students compared the factors of 16 and 8 from question 1, they noticed that both numbers have three 2s.

"Since students were familiar with the rules of divisibility, it was natural for them to use the divide-by-a-common-prime method when developing a procedure for calculating the greatest common factor. For instance, using this prime method in question 1 (16 apples and 8 oranges) yields the result in figure 5. In this method, since 16 and 8 have a common prime factor of 2, we divide each number by 2, resulting in respective quotients of 8 and 4, which are written below 16 and 8. Again, since 8 and 4 have a common prime factor of 2, dividing each number by 2 results in respective quotients of 4 and 2, which are written directly below 8 and 4.

"By using a real-life example, such as the Fruit Basket Challenge, students may be more likely to remember how to calculate the GCF and why it is important. If we are going to help students gain a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts and the procedures used with these concepts, we need to provide more opportunities for students to explore mathematics through specific tasks and engage students in problem-solving activities. Giving students the Fruit Basket Challenge allowed them to explore the concept of greatest common factor before the term was introduced. It also provided a visual context and allowed them to develop their own solution strategies for solving problems involving the GCF. Through this activity exploration, students were able to better understand the importance of finding the GCF and how it related to a real-life example.",66,mtms2011-11-222a,,
"As educators, we are constantly  striving to engage students, encourage learning, and answer that all-toofamiliar question, “When are we ever  going to use this?” This activity is designed to encourage student inquiry. Students must work with a partner to problem solve and determine a way to find how many of each fruit should be in each basket and how many baskets can be made. Most important, we have given students a reason to learn the concept of the greatest common factor since helping food pantries is something that many people are familiar with or have done. This activity not only caters to several learning styles, including visual and kinesthetic, but also opens up discussions among students and allows them to form their own conclusions before the teacher mentions the term greatest common factor.",67,mtms2011-11-222a,,
