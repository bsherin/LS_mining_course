"The Mystery of the Disappearing Calculators cCryptology is a branch of science  dealing with secret communications (Krystek 2000). The word cryptology is derived from the Greek word kryptos, meaning “hidden,” and logos, meaning “word.” Communicating through hidden messages has been in existence almost as long as written language.  chen-yao lin, cylin@siu.edu, is an assistant professor of mathematics education at Southern Illinois University in Carbondale.

"The practice of encrypting messages began in ancient times. The earliest recorded use of hidden messages for correspondence was used by the Spartans around 400 BC. They used a device known as a scytale to send secret messages between military commanders (Pell 2006). To use a scytale, a sheet of papyrus was wrapped in a spiral around a staff, a message was written down the length of the staff, and then the papyrus was unwrapped. To read the scrambled set of letters, the recipient had to have a staff that had the exact same diameter (MacKenzie 2003). ",3,mtms2008-11-245a,,
"Another early encryption method was used by Julius Caesar during military campaigns and became known as the Caesar cipher. To use the Caesar cipher, each letter in the original message was replaced by a letter a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. Caesar reportedly used the cipher with a shift of 3.

"Messages can be encrypted using a cipher, which is a system of encoding individual letters or pairs of letters in a message (Krystek 2000). A substitution cipher replaces the letters of the original message with other symbols or groups of symbols (Pell 2006). The Caesar cipher, or shift cipher, is an example of a substitution cipher.

"In The Crime and the Applet (activity sheet 1), students are presented with an encrypted clue that will reveal who has stolen a set of calculators. Using a Java applet designed as a substitution cipher system, students will practice encoding and decoding messages. To complete the activity, they will decode a crime message.

Writing and Decoding Messages (activity sheet 2) explains the relevance of functions in a substitution cipher system. Partnering to Decode Messages (activity sheet 3) will give students practice writing coded messages using functions and decoding a classmate’s message. ,9,mtms2008-11-245a,,
"The Crime and the Applet Solving mysteries appeals to students. To begin this activity, students are introduced to a crime. The only clue left at the scene is an encrypted message. An overhead projector could be used to display crime scene information. Students are asked to unscramble the encoded message—nslr wqmxl— and reveal who committed the crime. Before the students can decipher the encoded message, they will need practice in deciphering.",10,mtms2008-11-245a,,
"Part 1 of activity sheet 1 asks students to use an applet found at  illuminations.nctm.org/ActivityDetail .aspx?id=5 to help decode ciphertext. Before beginning any work, students should read the instructions. Students are told to enter a short message in the Uncoded Message box and to click the Update box to see the encoded message (see fig. 1). Students are also told how to decode messages by selecting the Decode box. Finally, students are encouraged to change the shift values of their encoded message to observe how the message changes. It should be explained to students that a shift changes the letters of the alphabet to a different letter. A shift can be either positive or negative. Part 1 asks students to enter the  message i love math into the Uncoded Message box and change the shift value from 1 to 4. Students should observe the encoded message of j mpwf nbui. They are then asked to change the shift values from 4 to −22; the encoded message for both shift values is the same. When students are asked why the encoded message for these  fig. 1 Using the Codes applet on the Illuminations site values is the same, they should understand that because the alphabet has twenty-six letters, shifting the alphabet four places in one direction is the same as shifting the alphabet twenty-two places in the other direction. ",11,mtms2008-11-245a,,
"In part 2, students experiment with  the applet and choose a short phrase to encode. Using the applet, the students enter their chosen phrase, then change the shift value to any number they choose. The encoded message is recorded on the activity sheet. Students are then asked to change the shift value to a new number. The encoded message is again recorded on the sheet. They are then asked if the encoded message is correct by looking at the graph on the applet. They should count the distance from the original letter to the encoded message, which should be the shift value. By using the graph, students are observing the one-to-one correspondence between the original letter and the new coded letter. This one-to-one correspondence is studied more in depth on activity sheet 2. ",12,mtms2008-11-245a,,
"Students are ready to decipher the  code and reveal who has stolen the  calculators. Part 3 of activity sheet 1 allows students to begin to decode the message. They should enter the encoded message into the Encoded Message box in lowercase letters and try different shift values, clicking Update between each, until the name of the criminal appears in the Uncoded Message box. When they have finished deciphering the code, the name John Smith should appear as the one responsible for stealing the calculators. The crime has been solved. ",13,mtms2008-11-245a,,
Writing and Decoding Messages,14,mtms2008-11-245a,,
"The Java applet accessed from the NCTM Illuminations Web site can be used for students to find a new code, but the overarching idea of this activity is for students to discover the concepts behind a function as they create their own codes. A one-to-one correspondence defines all functions. “Codes that have exactly one output letter for every input letter are examples of functions” (Foerster 2006, p. 5). In this way, only one letter in the plaintext, or uncoded message, corresponds to only one letter in the ciphertext, or encoded message. A hidden message can be  deciphered once a letter is found from the shift that was chosen. ",15,mtms2008-11-245a,,
"On activity sheet 2, students write  a message in plaintext in the box. They are then able to encrypt the message by creating a function using the graph. The alphabet is listed from left to right along the horizontal axis. The vertical axis’s alphabet is used for the encrypted message. Students will start with the letter A along the horizontal axis and make a one-toone correspondence to a letter on the vertical axis. Once this correspondence has been chosen, the student has the option of expressing the linear function with either addition or subtraction. It is important that students do not skip any letter being assigned across the graph. For example, if A is chosen to be written as the letter C in code, then the function would begin  f (A) = C. With this mapping, f (B) has two options (x is a variable): ",16,mtms2008-11-245a,,
Option 1:  f (B) = D would be a   mapping of f (x) = x + 2.,17,mtms2008-11-245a,,
Option 2:  f (B) = D would be a   mapping of f (x) = x – 24. ,18,mtms2008-11-245a,,
These two options show that students can decide on the shift of the letters to form the coded message.,19,mtms2008-11-245a,,
"Once the letters are graphed, the  message is easily encrypted. Each letter is used one at a time to make the encrypted message. Students must understand that a one-to-one correspondence defines a function. Question 4 alludes to this need for the student to define the code from the table and explain how the function works by showing examples that fit the function. The remainder of activity sheet 2 is meant to challenge the students on the fundamentals of a function. These questions assess the students’ understanding of the linear nature of the graph and explore how taking out the letter Z would change the function. ",20,mtms2008-11-245a,,
Partnering to Decode Messages,21,mtms2008-11-245a,,
"Students are asked to write a coded message for other classmates to decode in activity sheet 3. If given enough time, a student could create a crime scenario to explain to a classmate. This extra bit of information may be useful for helping the decoder solve the encoded message. The encryption must follow the same two rules: (1) the function must be linear and (2) consecutive letters must be used. This activity differs in that students must figure out the coded message using the methods and strategies learned from designing an encoded message of their own. For example, if the previous mapping of f (A) = C and f (B) = D were used, a student could have a coded message such as OCVJ . He or she could then try to decipher this coded message. Give students this information from Spangler (1999, p. 464): “People who decode messages are aided by the fact that in English, certain letters of the alphabet occur more frequently than others.” This knowledge will allow the student to make some educated guesses rather than random guesses.  teacher notes",22,mtms2008-11-245a,,
"When this lesson was used in my classroom, the students enjoyed playing detective and solving a crime. According to NCTM, “Middle-grades students should see mathematics as an exciting, useful, and creative field of study” (NCTM 2000, p. 211). The use of the applet worked well for this activity. However, many students had difficulty accessing the Web site because of typing errors; it would be helpful to have the Web site available as a link so that the students are not responsible for typing the address themselves. ",23,mtms2008-11-245a,,
"Allowing students to create their  own coded messages can further their understanding. In addition to shifts, students could add stretch values to the graph that would also preserve linearity.  (Go to illuminations.nctm.org/ ActivityDetail.aspx?id=5 and add different numbers in the Stretch Value box, for practice.) Stretching adds space between the letters. Students should write a message that is at least a few words long so that if a word is difficult to decode, the decoder could use another word. ",24,mtms2008-11-245a,,
"Answers are not included because they will vary, according to students’ choices.",25,mtms2008-11-245a,,
conclusion,26,mtms2008-11-245a,,
"Cryptology has many commercial applications. Encryption systems are brought into play when we check e-mail, use an ATM, make a call on a cell phone, and use a credit card to make a purchase over the Internet. We depend on encryption systems to “safeguard our privacy” as well as “prove our identity” (MacKenzie 2003). After being exposed to cryptology in this lesson, it is likely that some students will develop a growing interest in the subject and continue to explore its mysteries for years to come.
