"Students’ Geometric  Thinking about Rotations  and Benchmark Angles tThe Measurement Standard states  that understanding angles and angle measurement is important in the middle grades (NCTM 2000). To minimize misconceptions that the measure of an angle is determined by the length of its rays (Keiser 2000) or by its interior “space,” our curriculum research and development team decided to introduce angles and angle measurement using transformational geometry, specifically, the motion of rotation. Our class included ten fifth-grade students who had introductory experience with transformational geometry in the fourth grade. Our goals were for students to understand that 360 degrees measured a full rotation and to use this information to determine benchmark angles of 90 degrees, 180 degrees, and 270 degrees. To help achieve these goals, clockwise and counterclockwise movements were also emphasized. We hope the description of our students’ developing understandings of angles  and angle measurements will help you explore your students’ thinking about these concepts.  the tasKs",2,mtms2008-08-24a,,

"One student, Kevala, recalled that the center of rotation is “where the rotation is always happening; the center of rotation never moves but the arrow does.” Jackie explained her strategy to put her pencil “right on the center of rotation and turn [the ray] all the way until it gets back to where it was.” Several students noted that rotating the ray in either direction resulted in the same image. At this point, clockwise and counterclockwise were introduced. All the students completed the task using one ",5,mtms2008-08-24a,,

"full rotation. We explained that one full rotation has a measure of 360 degrees. Michael asked, “Why did it have to be 360 degrees? Why couldn’t it be 2 degrees?” The question prompted us to discuss the sometimes arbitrary nature of a mathematical definition or convention. We also shared some mathematical history: Babylonian mathematicians decided that the measure of one complete rotation would be 360 degrees because their year consisted of 360 days. ",11,mtms2008-08-24a,,
"Because no one considered more than one full rotation, we asked, “If more than one rotation were made resulting in an image on the original ray, how many degrees would that rotation be?” The majority of the group decided that the measure would still be 360 degrees because the resulting image was the same. Students’ reasoning included the following:",12,mtms2008-08-24a,,

"	You’re just kind of overlapping your circle, so you’re not really changing; you’re not really adding one circle onto another. You’re just overlapping.",15,mtms2008-08-24a,,
"Kevala:	 	If you were going to do the  circle but then you were going to move out a little bit more [i.e., creating a concentric circle], then it would be some other degree. But since you’re still going in the same circle, it’s still 360 degrees.",16,mtms2008-08-24a,,
"From these discussions, we determined that many students had a weak understanding of the facts that (1) the measures of the two angles that coincide physically are equal, and (2) two rays of different lengths rotated the same amount have different measures.",17,mtms2008-08-24a,,
"We were able to discuss the first  weak idea immediately, as a few students thought that another full rotation would yield 720 degrees. Courtney explained: ",18,mtms2008-08-24a,,
"I’m thinking that however many times you go around, you add the 360. You would add 360, 360.",19,mtms2008-08-24a,,
"Although we acknowledged students’ thinking that the resulting image would be the same, we explained to the class that each rotation should indeed be included in the measurement, so two full rotations would be 720 degrees. This explanation was acceptable to the students. At this point, we decided to delay discussion of the second weak idea. We wanted to keep the students focused on the idea of rotation to build on what they had learned in fourth grade in the context of angles. By continuing to emphasize that angles were formed by rotations, we were successfully able to address the notion that the length of the rays on an angle had no bearing on its measure.",20,mtms2008-08-24a,,
"Next, we asked the students to  draw rotations of 180 degrees and 90 degrees. Since students knew that a full rotation was 360 degrees, they drew these new angles easily by exercising proportional reasoning. These tasks gave them further opportunities to talk about motions, images, and clockwise and counterclockwise movements. We also introduced the terms straight	angle and right	angle. On their own, students brought up acute	angle and obtuse	angle because they had recently learned these terms while working on an art project. A discussion of types of angles followed, including the definition of reflex	 angles, all in terms of the rotation of a ray about its endpoint. Skyler pointed out that for a rotation resulting in a straight angle,  no matter if you go clockwise or counterclockwise, you still end up at the same place.",21,mtms2008-08-24a,,
"(See fig. 2.) The idea of “ending up in the same place” also arose when we asked students to share how they rotated a ray 270 degrees. Although Reed’s work (see fig. 3) showed that he made the 270 degree rotation by first rotating 180 degrees counterclockwise, followed by a 90 degree rotation in the same direction, he claimed that 270 degrees (counterclockwise) and 90 degrees (clockwise) were  equal because the 270 degree angle is counterclockwise, and then if you do the clockwise it would be the 90 degree angle.",22,mtms2008-08-24a,,
"In other words, the two actions show that the rays are “ending up in the same place.” An ensuing discussion shed light on the importance of how the ray was rotated to make an angle. Students realized that the original ray and its rotated image would look ",23,mtms2008-08-24a,,

"Fig. 4 Body rotations identical in these two situations but would indeed form different angles, based on the direction of the rotation. This knowledge reinforced the distinction between an angle being a “static” object and our “dynamic” definition of angle in terms of rotation.",27,mtms2008-08-24a,,
"To provide some immediate practice, we took the students outdoors to present a kinesthetic experience involving rotations. We asked students to use their body as the center of rotation and use an extended arm as a ray. (See fig. 4.) We oriented them to a “home” position by having everyone face in the same direction. We then asked them to make a clockwise rotation of 180 degrees. Skyler described the movement in this way: ",28,mtms2008-08-24a,,
"Since a 180 degree turn is just a straight line, you just kind of turned around.",29,mtms2008-08-24a,,
"As the students made the rotations, the terms clockwise and counterclockwise to describe the motions were reinforced. Having students then do counterclockwise and clockwise rotations of 90 degrees and 45 degrees reinforced their understanding of how direction and amount of rotation formed the angles. These concepts were later incorporated into activities involving construction of polygons.",30,mtms2008-08-24a,,

"Building on students’ prior knowledge of transformational geometry to develop an understanding of angle	is an approach we found worthwhile. With their knowledge of angles as rotations, students later had no problems using a protractor to draw and measure angles. They used a circular protractor with two scales, one for clockwise and one for counterclockwise measurements (see fig. 5), because we believed that students would easily relate it to their experiences with rotation. A grounded understanding of angle defined by rotation can help students determine how to use the variety of commercial protractors available. By thinking about the amount and direction of rotation in terms of the benchmark angles of 90 degrees, 180 degrees, and 270 degrees, students can estimate other angle measures.",32,mtms2008-08-24a,,
We hope that this “Take Time for Action”	will provide ideas for you to try with your middle-grades students. The tasks will enable you to see how your students’ understanding of angles and angle measurement develop.,33,mtms2008-08-24a,,
