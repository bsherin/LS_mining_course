Transformations using dynamic software can provide   a unique perspective on a common topic.,2,mtms2011-08-48a,,
"Scott Steketee and Daniel Scher tThe concept of function spans elementary school through high school. When introducing the topic to elementary school and middle school students, we ask them to work with a variety of examples and representations of functions, since a formal definition of a function is rather abstract. These representations involve experiences in which students— ·  use function machines to generate  output from input, ·  record input and output values in a  table, ·  substitute an input value in a formula  to generate an output value, and ·  graph input and output values using rectangular coordinates.",3,mtms2011-08-48a,,
"Our objective is to prepare students  to deal with functions in an increasingly formal way by the time they begin studying algebra in late middle school or in high school. The most  commonly used representations of functions are numeric in nature. Unfortunately, this emphasis on numeric experiences fails to acquaint students with the variety of mathematical relationships that can be represented as functions. As a result, it may contribute to common student misconceptions. Students may conclude that— ·  every function turns an input number into an output number; ·  every function can be expressed as  an algebraic formula; ·  a formula is the primary representation of a function, and that all other representations derive from it; ·  every function is linear, particularly if linear functions are all they have seen (these same students may later come to believe that every function fits into a limited set of categories, such as linear, quadratic, polynomial, exponential, and so forth); and ·  the ultimate test of a function  requires graphing it in rectangular coordinates and applying the vertical line test.",4,mtms2011-08-48a,,
"A related problem is that commonly used representations of functions portray input and output in a discrete and static way, failing to emphasize the continuous behavioral characteristics of many functions. Students choose discrete input values and have few opportunities to manipulate variables continuously and directly. In a similar way, tables and graphs show multiple input and output pairs but fail to communicate a sense of continuous variation of the input and output variables. As a result, students may understand a variable acting as a placeholder only, for which they can substitute particular constants, without fully understanding how such variables can actually vary continuously. They see the function’s behavior as a series of discrete snapshots rather than as a continuous movie.",5,mtms2011-08-48a,,
"transformations and loci are accessible  geometric functions. Regrettably, we do not  refer to them as functions and seldom  encourage students to connect these two terms.",6,mtms2011-08-48a,,
"Many of these misconceptions can  be addressed by giving students experience with representations that are nonnumeric and dynamic. Students can develop a deeper and more abstract view of functions by considering them in a dynamic geometry context (Hazzan and Goldenberg 1996). Dynagraphs (Goldenberg, Lewis, and O’Keefe 1992) are geometric representations of functions that lend themselves to making a connection between one-dimensional transformations and algebraic operations on the number line.",7,mtms2011-08-48a,,
"Other dynamic, nonnumeric  representations are readily available. During the same middle school years when students explore representations of numeric functions, they already study functions that are geometric in nature. We give the most accessible geometric functions completely different names: transformations and loci. Regrettably, we do not refer to them as functions and seldom encourage students to connect these two terms.",8,mtms2011-08-48a,,
"In the case of transformations, we use different terminology: The input is a pre-image and the output is an image. In the case of loci, we do not give explicit names to the input and output.",9,mtms2011-08-48a,,
"A transformation, or a locus, takes  a geometric object as input and produces a related geometric object as its output. These mathematical operations fi t the defi nition of a function in a way that is readily accessible to middle school students and provide an important opportunity to expand and deepen their ideas about functions. When students explore such functions in a dynamic environment, they  encounter the behavior of functions through the continuous variability of the input and output.",10,mtms2011-08-48a,,
"The remainder of this article discusses and provides examples of how exploring transformations and loci using dynamic geometry software, in this case The Geometer’s Sketchpad®, can expand students’ thinking about functions and encourage them to progress to a more sophisticated, abstract concept of these mathematical objects.  geoMetRic tRansFoRMations as FUnctions",11,mtms2011-08-48a,,
"In an algebraic function, the input and output are both numbers. A geometric transformation can be defi ned similarly—as a function that takes a point as input and produces another point as output. For instance, a student might refl ect a point across a mirror. Figure 1a shows the input point P and its refl ection P'. As the student drags P to vary the input, the output—the position of P'—is observed. ",12,mtms2011-08-48a,,
"In ﬁ gure 1b, the student uses dragging to explore a portion of the function; the traces record corresponding portions of the domain and the range. By recording the locations of the input and output variables, the traces are equivalent to a table of values in the numeric realm, with a sense of continuous rather than discrete variation. In ﬁ gure 1c, the student creates a triangle boundary and defi nes it as the domain by merging point P to it. The student then drags P around this domain to see P' trace out the range.",13,mtms2011-08-48a,,

An exploration such as this gives students the opportunity to consider how the output point depends on the input, to build up the transformed image point by point, and to consider the traces of the transformation’s preimage and image as the domain and range of a function. Students can use this same technique—transforming an input point to an output point—to explore slides, turns, stretches, and shrinks as functions.",16,mtms2011-08-48a,,

In ﬁ gure 2c, the relationship between P and P' has been defi ned as a Sketchpad 5 “custom transformation,” and this transformation has been applied to all the points on segment PC.",26,mtms2011-08-48a,,
"Because any point in the plane can  be transformed in this way, students  1. Functions need not be numeric. Students will quickly move beyond the  simplistic and limited idea that a function takes a number as its input and uses a specifi c algorithm or formula to produce a second number as its output.",27,mtms2011-08-48a,,
2. There is no one primary representation of function. Students should not be brainwashed by the idea that the “real” representation of a function is its equation and that other representations such as tables and graphs are merely windows on the representation as an equation.,28,mtms2011-08-48a,,
"3. Variables really vary. By dragging the input point of a transformation, locus,  or dynagraph, students experience variation kinesthetically. The input becomes truly a variable.",29,mtms2011-08-48a,,
"4. Variables can vary continuously. Students can extend to the numeric realm their sense of continuous variation of dragged points. They can more easily imagine numeric quantities varying continuously, not just serving as placeholders for discrete values.",30,mtms2011-08-48a,,
"5. Functions can be viewed atomically or collectively. At fi rst, students apply  a function atomically, transforming a single input point to a single output point. Over time, they progress to applying the function collectively, transforming an entire set of points all at once.",31,mtms2011-08-48a,,
"6. In the collective view, functions map pre-image to image, domain to range. ",32,mtms2011-08-48a,,
"Students see a collection of points as a coherent set that they can use as input to a function, resulting in a similarly coherent set of output points. Working with these collections of points helps them understand the concepts of domain and range and see how a function maps domain to range.  7. Functions can be multidimensional. Like points on a line, numbers are  one-dimensional. By experiencing geometric transformations as functions, students gain a sense that both input and output can be two-dimensional. Although they will not formally explore functions in two dimensions until much later, these early experiences provide them with valuable perspective.",33,mtms2011-08-48a,,
"8. Functions, transformations, loci, and mappings are related ways of  expressing the same deep mathematical concept. These terms are used in different contexts and put more or less emphasis on the atomic or collective view. Students begin to integrate these terms into a more comprehensive whole.",34,mtms2011-08-48a,,
"9. Deep connections are found  between algebra and geometry. experiences with geometric functions build on students’ early background with number lines, allowing them to experience variables and functions in the geometric realm. These experiences also prepare them for later encounters with functions that map pairs of coordinates in the plane to other pairs of coordinates.",35,mtms2011-08-48a,,
Function notation and transformations,36,mtms2011-08-48a,,
"Zalman usiskin and his colleagues at the university of Chicago School Mathematics Project (uCSMP) have advocated greater emphasis on transformations in k–12 geometry. The uCSMP high school textbook Geometry (usiskin et al. 1997) uses function notation to describe some transformations. For instance, a student might write rj(P) to indicate the reﬂ ection of point P across line j, and might write rk(rj(P)), or even rk (cid:30) rj(P), to indicate the reﬂ ection of point P fi rst across line j and then across line k. By using function notation in the context of transformations, students have an opportunity to associate concrete images with the formalism and to make sense of the sometimes confounding right-toleft ordering of the symbols for the individual transformations.",37,mtms2011-08-48a,,
"Such experiences using function  notation with geometric functions may be helpful in preparing students to use function notation with numeric variables. When students study composite functions, the mental image of rk(rj(P)) as a composite transformation that starts with point P, reﬂ ects across mirror j, and then reﬂ ects the result across mirror k can help students make similar sense of an algebraic composite function such as g(f(x)).",38,mtms2011-08-48a,,

"Domain (b) range can apply the custom transformation not only to the points that make up a segment but also to the points that make up an entire picture (see ﬁ g. 3). In this case, the domain is the rectangular pre-image (see ﬁ g. 3a) and the range is the swirled image (see ﬁ g. 3b). By applying the function to a picture, students can easily visualize how the function affects all the points in the domain defi ned by the pre-image.",44,mtms2011-08-48a,,
"This type of transformation is easily  modifi ed by changing the rule that produces the image. By changing the calculation, or by using transformations other than rotation, students can produce a wide variety of interesting functions. A student might create an angle parameter k, calculate the rotation ratio as PC • k/1 cm, and observe the effect of different ratios on the behavior of the swirling function. Another  student might investigate a function that dilates the input point by a ratio that depends on the distance from a center point. A third student might try a function that dilates the input point by a ratio that depends on the angle determined by the point, the dilation center, and a reference direction.",45,mtms2011-08-48a,,
"By engaging in such investigations,  students develop a sense for how the relationship between input, P, and output, P', determines the resulting picture—how the two-dimensional transformation is built up by applying a function to many individual input points.",46,mtms2011-08-48a,,

Consider, for example, the triangle refl ection example from ﬁ gure 1c. We might ask, “What is the locus of P' as P travels around the boundary of the triangle?” The common feature of both descriptions, as a transformation or as a locus, is that both are functions, with an independent variable, P, and a dependent variable, P'. ",50,mtms2011-08-48a,,
"Consider the example in ﬁ gure 4 where segment AP has its endpoint P on a circle. Figure 4b shows the locus of midpoint Q of the segment as P moves around the circle. Although this locus is equivalent to shrinking the circle by 50 percent toward center point A, it is expressed differently, both in the student’s conception and in the mechanism used to create it on the computer. But both mechanisms conform to the defi nition of a function: An independent variable, P, determines the position of a dependent variable, Q. Note how a locus differs from a trace. A trace is a static record of where the traced object has been; it does not change if the circle or point A is later moved. A locus is dynamic, responding immediately if either the  circle or point A is dragged.",51,mtms2011-08-48a,,
"Another example starts with a circle defi ned by center point C and point D on the circle (see ﬁ g. 5a). Point F is a random point inside the circle. How can we fi nd the locus of points equidistant from point F and the circle? To restate this problem in a form that involves a function, a student places an independent variable, point P, on the circle and changes the problem statement to, “Given point P on the circle, fi nd point Q that’s equally distant from point F and from the circle at point P.”",52,mtms2011-08-48a,,
"To solve the restated problem, the student constructs the perpendicular bisector of segment FP. This perpendicular bisector is the set of points equally distant from F and P (see ﬁ g. 5b). One of the points along this line must be equidistant from F and the circle at P. Since the student knows that the distance from a point to a circle is measured along an extended radius, he or she then constructs the extended radius through point P (see ﬁ g. 5c). The student realizes that intersection Q is the point that satisfi es the locus defi nition: It is equally distant from point F and from the circle at point P.",53,mtms2011-08-48a,,

"Most functions that students will meet in their study of algebra map a single real number (the input variable) to another single real number (the output variable). Mathematicians describe such functions as mapping (cid:29) → (cid:29): mapping the real numbers to the real numbers. (Some functions have limited ranges, or restricted domains, so that the domain or range is actually a subset of (cid:29) rather than all of (cid:29).)",56,mtms2011-08-48a,,
"As math teachers, we often use the number line as a way to help students visualize (cid:29). The number line expresses a deep connection between geometry and algebra; a mathematician might describe this in more abstract terms by saying that a number line puts the points on the line into a one-to-one correspondence with the elements of (cid:29). For this reason, we can consider a correspondence with the elements of (cid:29). For this reason, we can consider a function expressed in dynagraph form as equivalent to a function that maps function expressed in dynagraph form as equivalent to a function that maps (cid:29) → (cid:29); all we need to do is to turn the input and output axes into number (cid:29) → (cid:29); all we need to do is to turn the input and output axes into number lines.

An exploration like this encourages students to move from thinking about specifi c details (how the independent and dependent variables build up the locus one point at a time) to considering more general features (how the locus depends on the details of its defi nition).
