"Heads bob up and down, signifying agreement, as we teach a geometry lesson in a course for elementary school teacher candidates. We pat ourselves on the back and tell ourselves how well we have taught the lesson. Only later do we find that these teacher candidates did not understand the lesson as we thought. Student learning is fragile. Deep understanding develops over time and with repeated examples in a variety of contexts. Often their understanding is incomplete and may not transfer to a new situation.  requires focused and  to a larger audience. ",6,mtms2010-03-406a,,

"In addition to evaluating the  merits of mathematical justifications, students should recognize arguments that clearly communicate their reasoning to a wider audience. It is important for all learners, but particularly for teacher candidates, to clearly communicate ideas. When we talk with close friends, there is no question that they understand what we are thinking. This is not the case in the classroom. ",8,mtms2010-03-406a,,
"Teacher candidates in our classrooms often say “You know what I mean,” and we do; however, we try to be mindful of their future students by feigning ignorance or interpreting what they say from the vantage point of a learner who does not know what they mean. It is easy to fall into friendly conversational habits and infer what we expect to hear, but we know that this will not help  deliberate instruction.",9,mtms2010-03-406a,,
"In our teaching and in our everyday human endeavors, we often avoid hard questions. We ask questions in such a way that we get the answer that we would like. However, the answers to the hard questions are what often reveal a lack of both understanding and deeper meaning. A simple yes or no answer in the classroom may be misleading. Even when we ask students to show their work, it may not provide enough information to evaluate their understanding. Students frequently focus on getting  getting started on My  Mathematical Reasoning Book",10,mtms2010-03-406a,,
Students are given the following list to think about when preparing My Mathematical Reasoning Book.,11,mtms2010-03-406a,,
"•	 Look	at	specific	cases.	It	can	give	you	a	gut	feeling	about	 the problem.  •	 Use	extreme	cases.	As	you	collect	data,	investigate	extreme	 cases. Do not rely on “near perfect” cases.",12,mtms2010-03-406a,,
•	 Organize	your	data	into	a	table.	Systematically	organizing	your	 data will help reveal patterns that may lead to a solution.,13,mtms2010-03-406a,,
•	 Check	the	accuracy	of	your	data.	An	error	in	your	data	can	cause	 you to overlook or disregard a pattern that would have worked.,14,mtms2010-03-406a,,
•	 Look	for	a	counterexample.	Just	one	counterexample	is	all	that	is	needed	to	 show that something is not true.,15,mtms2010-03-406a,,
•	 Do	not	generalize	on	the	basis	of	one	or	two	examples.	Explore	additional	 examples	so	that	you	do	not	overlook	something	important.,16,mtms2010-03-406a,,
•	 Make	a	convincing	mathematical	argument.	Look	for	holes	in	your	logic.,17,mtms2010-03-406a,,
•	 Clearly	communicate	your	thinking.	Your	explanation	should	make	sense	  to others.  •	 Use	diagrams	to	help	make	your	point.	Diagrams	should	be	clearly	labeled	 and	referenced	in	your	explanation.,18,mtms2010-03-406a,,
our teacher candidates develop clear communication skills for their own classrooms. ,19,mtms2010-03-406a,,
"The same is true in the prekinder- garten through grade 12 classroom. If teachers want their students to develop deeper understanding of concepts, they cannot jump to “fill in the blanks” and “Didn’t you mean . . . ?” The struggle to clearly communicate an idea or justify an answer plays a critical role in student learning. ",20,mtms2010-03-406a,,
"The rationale for helping students  improve their ability to write mathematical arguments and communicate their reasoning clearly is compelling. However, the practical considerations are challenging for both preservice and in-service teachers. In our own practice as we work with teacher candidates, we often rely on teachable moments that arise naturally during classroom discussions to model how to make conjectures and justify them mathematically. This skill, although valuable, does not ensure that all students are growing in their own ability to reason mathematically. ",21,mtms2010-03-406a,,
"We emphasize the importance of learning to write mathematical arguments in students’ mathematical growth; however, we know that preaching does not have the same impact as personal experiences. Sometimes we include hard questions on homework assignments that warrant thoughtful consideration only to find that many students do not invest serious time and effort on these questions and instead wait for a peer to offer his or her conjectures and justifications during class. We would like to believe that a student adopts the desired mindset because it is the right thing to do; however, unless we factor his or her performance into our assessment procedures, it will most likely fall by the wayside. Unfortunately, hard questions do not lend themselves to traditional in-class tests because hard questions require adequate time for processing and reflection.  the MatheMatical Reasoning BooK",22,mtms2010-03-406a,,
"To focus on mathematical reasoning and what makes a good argument, we developed an assignment that requires college students to submit a book of mathematical reasoning as an assessment during the semester. To begin, we looked for questions and tasks that lend themselves to developing mathematical arguments and justifications and that reflected important ideas we had explored in class. (See fig. 1 for one such question and fig. 2 for students’ solutions.) We also searched for questions that were accessible to a variety of solution methods and multiple representations (NCTM 2000,  p. 271); (see fig. 3 for more questions). ",23,mtms2010-03-406a,,
"The students’ mathematical  reasoning books include solutions to six open-ended problem-solving questions that require students to apply ideas we investigated in class to a new situation. Solutions are evaluated both on the quality of students’ mathematical reasoning and their ability to communicate clearly. The problem solutions are submitted as a book titled My Mathematical Reasoning Book. What follows are typical student solutions to one of the problems from the book, our reflections about students’ thinking, and suggestions for how others might get started on a similar project. ",24,mtms2010-03-406a,,
"Fig. 1 A problem that appears in My Mathematical Reasoning Book should be difficult enough to merit discussion, thinking, and analysis by students.",25,mtms2010-03-406a,,
"The area of ∆AEB is 16 cm2. If possible, determine the area of the parallelogram ABCD.   a PRoBleM to solVe",26,mtms2010-03-406a,,
"In the problem from My Mathematical Reasoning Book shown in figure 1, the student is asked to determine the area of the parallelogram, if possible, given the area of the shaded triangle embedded in the parallelogram. Students begin work by knowing formulas for the areas of parallelograms and triangles; however, in this case, it is not obvious how to apply those formulas when the dimensions of the figures are not given. The problem also requires a thoughtful understanding of the concepts rather than just recalling memorized procedures. Figure 2 shows examples of students’ work that show different ways of reasoning through this problem. In some cases, the reasoning is flawed; in other cases, the student’s thinking is correct, but he or she has not made a convincing argument. Finally, we offer three different solution strategies that model complete justifications and are clearly communicated.",27,mtms2010-03-406a,,
"An Incorrect Solution In figure 2a, Jake’s response is incorrect and underscores how challenging it can be for a student to transfer mathematical concepts to a new context. He concludes that not enough information is given in this problem to come to any conclusion. It is interesting to read that he cites a lack of information about the triangle’s angle measures as the reason that the area cannot be determined. It is unclear how information about angle measure would lead him to a correct response. His conclusions revealed misconceptions about area and what information is needed to solve the problem. His mindset about needing more measures to proceed is a roadblock that will prevent him from moving forward and engaging in mathematical reasoning.",28,mtms2010-03-406a,,

"In Focus in High School Mathematics: Reasoning and Sense Making, emphasis is placed on students’ reasoning habits and ways of thinking that need to be a part of our mathematics classroom.	In	particular,	informal	explanation	and	justification	are	parts	 of sense making and reasoning.

"The following are suggestions for instructional practices that  set the stage for, that create a climate for, and that engage students in the process of, mathematical reasoning.",31,mtms2010-03-406a,,
Set the Stage for Mathematical Reasoning •	 Model	the	kinds	of	questions	that	students	need	to	ask	themselves	during	 classroom	conversations:	“Are	you	sure?”	“how	do	you	know?”	“Is	that	true	 all the time?” “Is there another way to look at this?”  •	 provide	examples	of	both	clear	justifications	as	well	as	explanations	that	 are not thoroughly developed for class discussion. Finding the loopholes in an	incomplete	argument	can	be	a	powerful	learning	experience.,32,mtms2010-03-406a,,
"•	 Select	problems	that	relate	to	important	mathematical	ideas.	Reserve	the	 hard questions for big ideas, important concepts, or places in the curriculum in which common misconceptions appear.  •	 plan	classroom	activities	that	require	the	organization	of	data	to	make,	vali- date,	or	refute	a	conjecture.	Model	with	the	class	how	to	investigate	and	 reason through a problem.",33,mtms2010-03-406a,,
"•	 Integrate	mathematical	reasoning	into	your	assessment	plan.	We	communicate the things that we value through our assessment. As you begin to think about assessing mathematical reasoning, consider alternative assessments.",34,mtms2010-03-406a,,
•	 Assess	mathematical	reasoning	early	in	the	year	or	at	the	beginning	of	the	 semester. This sends a message to the class that it has value. It also sets the	tone	for	learning	expectations.,35,mtms2010-03-406a,,
"Create a Climate That Promotes Mathematical Reasoning •	 Build	a	sense	of	community	in	your	classrooms	so	students	feel	free	to	 express	their	ideas	honestly	and	openly,	without	fear	of	ridicule.	 •	 Monitor	participation	during	whole-class	discussions	to	ensure	that	some	 students are not left out of the discussion for long periods. ",36,mtms2010-03-406a,,
Engage Students in the Process of Mathematical Reasoning •	 Challenge	students	to	consider	possible	limitations	to	their	reasoning	and	 provide meaningful feedback to better communicate what you are looking for when you ask for a mathematical argument.  •	 Give	students	opportunities	to	critique	others’	explanations	or	justifications.	 •	 Allow	students	to	write	a	second	draft	on	the	basis	of	feedback	that	they	receive.,37,mtms2010-03-406a,,
