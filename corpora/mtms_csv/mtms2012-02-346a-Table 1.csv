"Developmentally, middle school students progress from being concrete thinkers and learners to abstract thinkers (Piaget and Inhelder 1958). Traditional middle school mathematics instruction introduces a curriculum that is intuitive and taught within a natural trajectory of the content. However, with this traditional approach, students may miss out on being exposed to challenging and complex topics from advanced mathematics that can greatly expand the way that students think mathematically. Concepts such as infi nite sets can be counterintuitive, but they can hold the interest of most students. Perhaps this is because of their inherent eccentricity, which is counter to ",4,mtms2012-02-346a,,

"With this activity, the resident challenged the students’ ability to think about infinity, a rich, abstract mathematical concept. It also stretched their creativity. Although most students had heard of infinity, this activity required them to think more deeply about it and advanced their logical abilities, as observed in class discussions.",7,mtms2012-02-346a,,
"The lesson involved sizes, or cardinality, of infinite sets, culminating in a proof that there are more real numbers than counting numbers. Before this lesson, nearly every student had a working idea of infinity, although they had difficulty formalizing their thoughts. The material presented in this lesson aligns with traditional topics of middle school mathematics: sets; subsets; and the real numbers, including integers and rational and irrational numbers. The lesson then extends those concepts to introduce advanced ideas about quantities beyond numbers. Although students were not experts in cardinality after this lesson, they certainly had thought abstractly about this complex concept, as could be observed from classroom discussions. This topic could be expanded in future lessons by considering infinite objects in a variety of contexts (Monaghan 2001).",8,mtms2012-02-346a,,
"Guided questions allowed students to discover the concepts in an inquirybased fashion. Rather than teach the students about bijections and set notation, as might be common when teaching about infinite cardinalities, minimal definitions and notation were used. We use technical terminology in this article to clarify our presentation to readers; however, instruction to students emphasized that mathematical notation is not mathematics but an organizing tool of mathematical concepts, just as musical notation is not music but a tool for organizing musical thought. Clickers were used as voting devices to ensure student engagement, and volunteers were  asked to explain their reasoning for a given query. In this way, students were able to engage and participate in their own discussion about the abstraction of infinity, even when they had only a rudimentary understanding of decimal expansions.",9,mtms2012-02-346a,,
"This guided exploration was  designed for a single, fifty-minute class period with students in grades 6 through 9. The students had previously studied geometry, linear equations, and proportions; they did not need specific preparation in content for this lesson.

how Big is Big?,11,mtms2012-02-346a,,
"The class began with an informal discussion of infinity. When asked what they knew about the topic, students engaged in a rich discussion and displayed a basic understanding of infinity with statements such as these: ·  Something that doesn’t end; it just  keeps going.",12,mtms2012-02-346a,,

"Since most students considered infinity (∞) to be an extremely large number, it was repeatedly emphasized that the term meant an idea, not a number. To better understand the meaning of infinity, the class discussed the number of grains of sand on Earth. One student said, “You could never count all the grains of sand on Earth.” The resident then asked, “Would that quantity be finite or infinite?”",15,mtms2012-02-346a,,
"After some small-group discussion, everyone was convinced that the sand grains are finite. To make sure they understood the concept, the resident asked whether the number of words in every book ever written was finite or  infinite. The students’ natural tendencies were to attempt to count such a set. After a few more of these examples (the number of visible stars in the sky, the number of seconds since the sun started shining), the class discussed some infinite quantities (the number of possible fractions, the number of even numbers), and then delved into the heart of the lesson.",16,mtms2012-02-346a,,
Resident: Could there be different  sizes of infinity? ,17,mtms2012-02-346a,,
Students: What do you mean by sizes of infinity? How can you compare infinity?,18,mtms2012-02-346a,,
"Students: If you can’t count it, then it’s  infinite. There aren’t any sizes.",19,mtms2012-02-346a,,
"Natural intuition leads to contradictions, so the resident pushed the discussion in that direction by asking, “How many even numbers are there?” The students responded that there are an infinite number. The conversation continued:",20,mtms2012-02-346a,,
Resident: And how many counting  numbers are there?,21,mtms2012-02-346a,,
Students: Of course infinite.,22,mtms2012-02-346a,,
"Resident: So which is larger? The  set of positive even numbers,  {2, 4, 6, 8, . . . }, or the set of counting numbers, {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, . . . }? ",23,mtms2012-02-346a,,
"The clear consensus among the students was that the set of counting numbers was larger. Nearly every student expressed the idea that a proper subset of a set must be smaller than the original set. Although these two ideas (that all infinite sets are the same size and that there are fewer evens than counting numbers) contradicted each other, no student could explain his or her answer. The discussion continued and gained momentum when the resident asked if the students thought that there are more positive even numbers or positive odd numbers. One student responded, “It  depends on where you stop counting.” Several students nodded in agreement. By their logic, if you stopped counting on an odd, then there is one more odd than even. The resident then asked the students if they thought the odds or evens ever stop. One student answered, “No, but if you stopped counting on an odd, then. . . .” ",24,mtms2012-02-346a,,
"It took time to emphasize that students were not stopping at any point. Naturally, they wanted to count to the end of both sets and compare the number. Again, the resident discussed the fact that infinity was not a number, eliciting questions: ",25,mtms2012-02-346a,,
Students: Who cares about sizes of  infinities anyway? How does this matter?,26,mtms2012-02-346a,,
Resident: Humans have been using  numbers to count money and food since the start of time. Shouldn’t we know whether there are more evens or more odds?,27,mtms2012-02-346a,,
"Students: If infinity isn’t a number, how can you compare different sizes of infinity?",28,mtms2012-02-346a,,

"The resident attempted to make the idea clearer by talking about baseballs and baseball gloves in hopes of tying something concrete to something abstract. He posed the following question:   I have a bunch of gloves and balls. If I can put a ball in every glove and ensure that there are no empty gloves and no balls without a glove, then there must be the same number of gloves as balls, right? ",30,mtms2012-02-346a,,
"After the students agreed on the baseball example, they transitioned back to numbers. The resident used the glove and ball idea to illustrate the fact that there are as many positive even integers as positive odd integers. ",31,mtms2012-02-346a,,
Mathematics is not  always about  completing concrete thinking first or staying within a trajectory or curricular boundary.,32,mtms2012-02-346a,,
"He explained that the students should imagine that the positive odd integers are baseballs and that the positive even integers are gloves (with ball 1 in glove 2, ball 3 in glove 4, ball 5 in glove 6, and so on). ",33,mtms2012-02-346a,,
"The students asked if the numbers  could be paired differently, and the resident confirmed it but reminded them that every even was paired with an odd and that every odd was paired with an even. He asked the students to consider as well what would happen if zero was included in the set of positive even numbers. That is, if E = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, . . .}, are there more evens or are there more odds? Students responded that “There are more evens now” and “There is nothing to match to zero.” The students broke into small groups but within minutes arrived at the bijection 0 ↔ 1, 2 ↔ 3, 4 ↔ 5. By now, most of the students’ heads were hurting, and a break was necessary. ",34,mtms2012-02-346a,,
"This discussion about one-to-one  correspondence was at the heart of the lesson. Depending on the class, it may be advantageous to have the students physically act out the pairing. For example, assign students numbers from the first set and write numbers from the other set on some chairs. Then have every student try to find a seat. Repeat the exercise using a larger number, smaller number, or same number of chairs than students. The students should quickly grasp this example (since it is finite) and be able to apply their reasoning to infinite examples.  the infinite hotel",35,mtms2012-02-346a,,
"After the previous discussion, the students had a rough idea that inserting one more element into an infinite set does not change the sets it can be paired with. To provide a concrete example and a scaffolding approach of thinking and processing, the resident posed the following scenario (Faticoni 2006):  Imagine that there is an infinite hotel called the Hilbert Hotel. The rooms are numbered by the counting numbers, {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, . . . }, and every room has an occupant. A person shows up and wants a room, but the hotel manager says that the hotel is full. This individual suggests a way to remedy the situation: “Tell the person in room 1 to move to room 2. Have the person in room 1 tell the person in room 2 to move to room 3. Continue on, having the person in room n move to room n + 1. Then everyone would have a room, and I will take room 1.”",36,mtms2012-02-346a,,
"Students: Well, then the hotel must  not have been full if it could make room for another guest.",37,mtms2012-02-346a,,
Students: Why didn’t the man just  take the last room instead of making everyone move down?,38,mtms2012-02-346a,,
"The question “What is the last room?” generated even more discussion, especially after many numbers were called out. ",39,mtms2012-02-346a,,
Students: A googolplex. A million billion billion trillion.,40,mtms2012-02-346a,,
Students: Any number past a googolplex doesn’t have a name; can’t count any higher.,41,mtms2012-02-346a,,
"Resident: Even if a number doesn’t  have a name, it still exists and has a value, doesn’t it? ",42,mtms2012-02-346a,,
Students: How can you prove that the counting numbers never end if no one has ever counted that far? ,43,mtms2012-02-346a,,
"Resident: Well, here’s the proof: Name  any number that you think is the biggest.",44,mtms2012-02-346a,,
Students: One hundred billion trillion  quadrillion!,45,mtms2012-02-346a,,
Resident: Well isn’t one hundred billion trillion quadrillion and one still a bigger number? ,46,mtms2012-02-346a,,
"The resident was surprised by the amount of discussion generated by this single question. Perhaps the question (and the buildup) truly emphasized how different were infinite sets from finite sets. The abstract thinking required the students to consider numbers that did not have traditional names. This was a big step for some students. After they began discussing the previous activities within smaller groups, the baseball and glove analogy resurfaced. The resident took the lead and asked, “Can we pair every even number with every counting number?” ",47,mtms2012-02-346a,,
"After a short group discussion  about how to match the two sets of numbers, the entire class found the natural bijection 1 ↔ 2, 2 ↔ 4,  3 ↔ 6, 4 ↔ 8. . . . After finding the pairing scheme, even more students than before were convinced that infinity was infinity and that any two infinite sets can be matched.  revisiting the infinite hotel",48,mtms2012-02-346a,,
"After students convinced themselves that evens and odds could be paired, the lesson naturally progressed to show that one set of counting numbers could be paired with two sets of counting numbers. For the resident to point out how contrary infinity is to common sense, he returned to the more concrete Infinite Hotel example, which students described as “cool”:  Imagine that across the street from the Hilbert Hotel is another infinite hotel called the Cantor Inn. Both hotels have their rooms numbered as before, {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, . . . }, and each room in each hotel has  fig. 1 Not all real numbers between 0 and 1 can be counted, as shown by this table of rational numbers.  0.1111111 . . .

Everyone runs across the street to look for a room. The hotel manager at the Cantor Inn says that all the rooms are full, but a guest from the burning hotel speaks up with the following solution: “Tell the man in room 1 to move to room 2, the man in room 2 to move to room 4, the man in room n to move to room 2n. Then every odd-numbered room will be open, so we can all have a place to stay.” a Missing nuMBer",49,mtms2012-02-346a,,
"A further investigation was conducted for students who were still engaged  because the majority of classes was fired up and questioning the activities and concepts. The resident asked if the real numbers could be paired with the counting numbers. Since most students were now certain that all infinite sets could be matched, it was necessary for the resident to assert that there is no way to match the real numbers between zero and one to the counting numbers without missing a real number. Technically, it means that no bijection exists from the counting numbers to (0, 1).",50,mtms2012-02-346a,,
"A student responded, “Well of course there are more reals; there are infinitely many between any two numbers.” The resident reminded the class that between any two whole numbers there are infinitely many rational numbers, but even the set of all rational numbers can be matched with the counting numbers. He wanted to convince (and the students wanted to be convinced) that you cannot match the real numbers strictly between 0 and 1 to the counting numbers. To help the students think about this, he asked, “Suppose that you could list the real numbers between 0 and 1. What would be the first? Give me your favorite real number between 0 and 1.”",51,mtms2012-02-346a,,
Students listed the numbers shown  in figure 1a. The resident next asked the students to consider a way to make a new number that could not be on this list: “Take the first number and add 1 to the first digit. Then take the second number and add 1 to the second digit.” (See fig. 1b.) ,52,mtms2012-02-346a,,
"Continue this process until you get the number then starting with 0.232018. . . . This number would be missing from the list since it is different from every number given. It is different from the first number in the first digit, different from the second number in the second digit, and different from the 47th number in the 47th digit. Since this number is different in at least one digit from  every number on the list, then it is missing from the list. So we can’t list every number without missing one.",53,mtms2012-02-346a,,
"The resident felt that only a third of the class was still engaged at this point, but that was okay. He told them how much difficulty he had with this topic when he learned about it in college. In the end a student said, “Every question we answer, you say we aren’t right. If we say infinity is infinity, we aren’t right. If we say two infinities are different, you say we aren’t right. What’s the answer?” The resident liked that response because it validated to him how different infinity is from the finite numbers that people deal with in their daily lives. ",54,mtms2012-02-346a,,
"By avoiding mathematical notation and exploring other avenues of mathematics, the resident introduced students to an abstract concept and challenged their abilities. Ericka Legnard, the math teacher at Englewood Leadership Academy where these lessons were taught, appreciated the insight and exposure that her students were given, using these basic activities for guided exploration. She hoped the activity  would allow the students to see the more esoteric part of math, even if they don’t fully understand it. Bait the hook a little for future classes. It’s definitely something that most middle school kids (heck, teachers!) don’t get to think about. I think it opens the door for some who aren’t great at computation, which has been the majority of their experience, and shows them something that makes sense to them.",55,mtms2012-02-346a,,
conclusion,56,mtms2012-02-346a,,
"The study of infinite sets can be supplemented and expanded in a variety of ways. The history behind Cantor’s development of infinity was surprisingly controversial at the time (Laugwitz 2002). Exposing students to the infighting among mathemati- cians, scientists, and philosophers, and what the historical perspectives and some of the motivating factors were at the time of particular mathematical discoveries are interesting ways to present this, and other, material. Students may also be interested to discover that sets exist that are larger than the real numbers. ",57,mtms2012-02-346a,,
"Mathematics is not always about completing concrete thinking first or staying within a trajectory or curricular boundary. Sometimes teaching is about encouraging students to think about something they have not thought about before, about something abstract that pushes their secure ideas about mathematics and mathematical reasoning.
