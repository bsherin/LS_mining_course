"Research money is being pumped into the use of ethanol, an alternative to oil, which is made from corn. Ethanol is currently being used in vehicles. A mixture called E85 has the highest amount of ethanol at 85 percent; the remaining 15 percent is gasoline. Keep the following statistics in mind when considering the usage of E85: •	 From	each	bushel	(56	pounds)	 of corn, an ethanol refinery can produce approximately 2.8 gallons of ethanol and approximately 17 pounds of feed for farm animals.  •	 The	average	yield	of	corn	in	2008	 was	150.7	bushels	per	acre.	 •	 For	calculation	purposes	only,	 estimate that 15 percent of the total corn produced is sent to an ethanol refinery.

"Math toPics addressed: •	Filtering	appropriate	information •	Finding	percent	change •	 Converting	units	and	applying	rates	 3.	 In	2008,	ethanol	refineries	produced about 9 billion gallons of ethanol. Approximately how many bushels of corn were used in ethanol	production?	How	many	acres	 of farmland were used to grow this corn? 4.	 In	June	2009,	the	average	price	for	 a	gallon	of	gasoline	was	$2.69;	the	 average price for a gallon of E85 was $2.18. What is the percent savings for a motorist who uses E85? 5.  Reports show that a car’s gas mileage	using	E85	may	be	30	 percent less compared with the mileage using regular unleaded gasoline. If a car averages 27 miles per	gallon	(mpg)	with	regular	unleaded gasoline, what will be the mpg using E85? ",6,mtms2009-09-120a,,
