12,Connecting and Using Multiple Representations,"MULTIPLE eEffective mathematics teaching helps students appreciate the value of using varied forms of representation and asks students to refl ect on their reasons for using representational forms (NCTM 2000, 2014). Mathematics teachers should encourage students to use a variety of representations while problem solving (NCTM 2000, 2014). Problem solving involves a problematic (i.e., worthwhile or rich) task and a goal for a problem solver; however, the pathways to reach that goal are not always obvious (Bostic, Pape, and Jacobbe 2016; Schoenfeld 2011; Yee and Bostic 2014). A pathway to a problem’s solution requires strategic representation use (Lesh and Doerr 2003; Schoenfeld 2011; Yee and Bostic 2014). ",12,Connecting and Using Multiple Representations
13,Connecting and Using Multiple Representations,"Broadly speaking, representations may be categorized as symbolic and nonsymbolic (Goldin and Kaput, 1996; Yee and Bostic 2014). Symbolic representations are abstract, symboldriven ways of expressing oneself that include such forms as expressions, equations, and inequalities (Goldin and Kaput 1996; Yee and Bostic 2014). Nonsymbolic representations include all other representational forms, such as diagrams or pictures, graphs, tables, verbal expressions, and concrete models (Lesh and Doerr 2003; Yee and Bostic 2014). Multiple representations are characterized as two or more forms of representation that lead to a solution (Bostic et al. 2016; Yee and Bostic 2014). ",13,Connecting and Using Multiple Representations
14,Connecting and Using Multiple Representations,"If students engage in the use of  multiple representations, then they are more likely to connect these mathematical representations to previously learned mathematics topics and, in turn, build greater conceptual understanding (Bostic et al. 2016). Moreover, students who use multiple representations while problem solving are more effective problem solvers than those who use only one representation (Bostic et al. 2016; Yee and Bostic 2014). Proficient problems solvers tend to use— different representations [which] is like examining the concept through a variety of lenses, with each lens providing a different perspective that makes the picture [concept] richer and deeper.

15,Connecting and Using Multiple Representations,Principles to Actions: Ensuring ,15,Connecting and Using Multiple Representations
16,Connecting and Using Multiple Representations,"Mathematical Success for All (NCTM 2014) emphasizes eight teaching practices for effective mathematics teaching, one of which is to “use and connect multiple representations” (NCTM 2014, p. 24). An action that describes how teachers might promote this practice is to “allocate substantial instructional time for students to use,  discuss, and make connections among representations” (NCTM 2014, p. 29). Two student actions for this practice include making “choices about which forms of representations to use as tools for solving problems.” In addition, students need to consider the advantages or suitability of using various representations when solving problems” (NCTM 2014, p. 29). ",16,Connecting and Using Multiple Representations
17,Connecting and Using Multiple Representations,The aim of this article is to help  teachers address these actions through instructional strategies illustrated by vignettes from action research conducted during a unit on functions with eighth-grade students. The first author was the instructor conducting action research in a suburban middle school in the Midwest. This article is told through her point of view. The second author offered feedback during the action research. All student names are pseudonyms. ,17,Connecting and Using Multiple Representations
18,Connecting and Using Multiple Representations,SETTING THE STAGE FOR MULTIPLE REPRESENTATIONS,18,Connecting and Using Multiple Representations
19,Connecting and Using Multiple Representations,"I taught three sections of eighthgrade mathematics with a total of 65 students. The classes were 44 minutes long, and the learning segment, which focused on linear functions, lasted seven classes. During the first week, we addressed multiple representations. During the second week, we explored using multiple representations during problem solving. One task from the learning segment is shared. I conducted my action research in all three sections of eighth-grade mathematics. Action research is “a systematic and intentional inquiry carried out by teachers” (Cochran-Smith and Lytle 1993, p. 7). It is “the process of studying a real school or classroom situation to understand and improve the quality of actions or instruction” ( Johnson 2012, p. 16). My two objectives for this action research were (1) to investigate whether students might use more than one representation during problem solving if they received instruction  on the benefits of multiple representations and (2) to examine why students chose the representations they did during problem solving. Results from the action research helped me reflect on my instructional choices, especially about students’ uses of representation. ",19,Connecting and Using Multiple Representations
20,Connecting and Using Multiple Representations,"Before the learning segment, I provided students with a preassessment to explore their ideas of functions when presented in various representations (e.g., graphs, tables, and equations). (See the entire preassessment, which is available online as a more4U document at http:// www.nctm.org/mtms.) Two tasks are shown in figure 1. Few students correctly answered task 1 in figure 1a. I noticed that students did not perceive that the table and graph in this figure were connected because students gave different answers for the table and graph. Additionally, students were instructed to solve three word problems using as many representationally different approaches as they were able (see fig. 1b). The focus of the preassessment was to assess students’ use of multiple representations. ",20,Connecting and Using Multiple Representations
21,Connecting and Using Multiple Representations,"The average score on the pre-  assessment was 15 percent, which represents getting fewer than one correct item. On average, students were able to use one representation per item. The most commonly used representation to solve the problem was a table (83 percent). All students who arrived at a correct answer used a table to solve the problem. At this time, students had yet to be introduced to exponential functions, which may explain why many chose to use a table. These results indicate that students struggled to use multiple representations effectively during problem solving. ",21,Connecting and Using Multiple Representations
22,Connecting and Using Multiple Representations,"I interviewed three students following the preassessment to explore their representation choices. (For interview questions, see the more4U supplementary materials.) Interview data further confirmed the difficulties that students  were having when translating between representations. A common theme from the interviews was that students used a table because they did not know other viable representation choices. Students were unable to elaborate on their reasoning beyond “I don’t know,” even after I pressed them for further explanation. Allison said, “Normally, I use an equation, but I didn’t know how to for this problem.” ",22,Connecting and Using Multiple Representations
23,Connecting and Using Multiple Representations,"Students also implied that they  might use only one representation unless the directions told them otherwise. Andy stated, “If you didn’t ask me, I would have just made a table because that answered the question.” Drawing on the quantitative and qualitative data led me to the conclusion that students used one representation because they did not consider alternatives. I set out to design instruction that might assist them with using multiple representations. My students needed help discerning types of functions and opportunities to identify the use and purpose of representations. Further conversations with them suggested that students did not know how to characterize mathematical representations.",23,Connecting and Using Multiple Representations
24,Connecting and Using Multiple Representations,Supporting Students’ Use of Language: Frayer Models and Venn Diagrams,24,Connecting and Using Multiple Representations
25,Connecting and Using Multiple Representations,"I began my unit with a Frayer model (see fi g. 2) to characterize the notion of a mathematical representation. A Frayer model is a tool for contextualizing vocabulary. Students were expected to defi ne what it means to represent, give examples of representations, and list types of representations using a thinkpair-share format for the Frayer model. First, students worked alone for two minutes with the directions to fi ll in the quadrants as best they could. Next, they were given fi ve minutes to discuss what they wrote in small groups. Finally, we convened as a whole class to complete the Frayer model (see fi g. 2). ",25,Connecting and Using Multiple Representations

33,Connecting and Using Multiple Representations,"The whole-group instruction took fi fteen minutes. As students fi rst began to work on the Frayer model, I noticed that they identifi ed only types of representations, not examples or defi nitions. Thus, I decided that students needed instruction on multiple representations because they could not defi ne what representations were. Students were asked two questions to help them think about multiple representations:  1. What are multiple  representations?  2. How might multiple  representations be used? ",33,Connecting and Using Multiple Representations
34,Connecting and Using Multiple Representations,"Student responses to these questions revolved around using representations  to fi nd the correct answer. However, many students agreed that you would need only one representation to answer a question. Initially I encouraged students to focus on types of representations and examples. Identifying various types of representations, which we incorporated into our examples, allowed us to have a brief conversation about how representations can be connected. Next, we created a working defi nition. This approach helped students develop an understanding about mathematical representations. Cynthia revoiced our defi nition as, “Representations are how we can show and fi gure out a relationship.” Additionally, using a Frayer model on day 1 ensured that students shared my expectation ",34,Connecting and Using Multiple Representations
35,Connecting and Using Multiple Representations,Fig. 3 This is an example of what the class constructed following whole-class discussion.,35,Connecting and Using Multiple Representations
36,Connecting and Using Multiple Representations,for what it meant to represent a mathematical idea in different ways. ,36,Connecting and Using Multiple Representations
37,Connecting and Using Multiple Representations,"During the remaining six days of the learning segment, I emphasized linear functions, which addressed the Common Core’s content standards; for example, 8.F.A.2: “Compare properties of two functions each represented in a different way. . . . Interpret the equation y = mx + b as defi ning a linear function, whose graph is a straight line (CCSSI 2010, p. 55). During the last ten minutes of class on days 2–4, exit slips focused on comparing and contrasting representations using Venn diagrams were administered to students. Five minutes were dedicated to individual work time, and the remaining time was dedicated to wholeclass discussion. One Venn diagram compared tables and graphs, another compared graphs and equations, and a third compared equations and tables (see fi g. 3). This activity allowed students to refl ect on the benefi ts and drawbacks of using specifi c types of representations, which aligns with the student action to “consider the advantages and suitability of using various representations when solving problems” (NCTM 2014, p. 29). Students expressed that these Venn diagrams were helpful because we initially took class time to defi ne what it means to use a representation. I refl ected on having students create multiple Venn diagrams and drew the conclusion that they needed to use a table to compare and contrast the different types ",37,Connecting and Using Multiple Representations

52,Connecting and Using Multiple Representations,"Boundary Points: 10 of representations. Evidence for this conclusion included two aspects. First, students had been comparing only two representations at a time. They might want to use all three representations because of situations embedded within a function task. Second, many of the Venn diagrams focused on characteristics of various representations but not necessarily the advantages and disadvantages of representations. To address this conclusion, I created a template for students to synthesize their ideas and further engage them in student actions described by NCTM (2014). ",52,Connecting and Using Multiple Representations
53,Connecting and Using Multiple Representations,A CASE FOR MULTIPLE REPRESENTATIONS: SEEING THE BENEFITS,53,Connecting and Using Multiple Representations
54,Connecting and Using Multiple Representations,"On day 5 of the learning segment, I asked students to look at the advantages and disadvantages of three representations. The purpose of this activity was to help students recognize when they might want to use different types of representations while solving function-related tasks. Students received a teacher-created template and then worked for ten minutes in groups of four. Following small-group time, we came together as a whole class to synthesize ideas for another ten minutes (see table 1). ",54,Connecting and Using Multiple Representations
55,Connecting and Using Multiple Representations,"Next, I wanted them to apply what  they had learned from exploring the advantages and disadvantages while problem solving. The linear functions  task was adapted from a Mathematics Teaching in the Middle School lesson (Bair and Cady 2014). Students created various polygons on geoboards. Students were instructed to find and describe the relationship between the number of boundary points and the area of polygons. The students considered cases where the polygon enclosed zero, one, two, or three interior points (see fig. 4). They were not told how to represent the relationship. The only direction that students received was to represent the relationship between area and boundary points. I did this purposefully because I aimed to encourage students to “make choices about which forms of representations to use as tools for solving problems” (NCTM 2014, p. 29). Furthermore, I wanted to allocate “substantial instructional time for students to use, discuss, and make connections among representations” (NCTM 2014, p. 29). Students were expected to determine the best way to represent the relationship. Groups of four students worked on this task for two days (days 6–7 of 7). Each group presented its findings at the end of the second day of this task (see fig. 5). Students used a diagram and a table initially, but later communicated a desire to use an equation. At one point, Suzie asked me, “Can we use an equation to represent the relationship?” ",55,Connecting and Using Multiple Representations

I noticed that students were able to clearly identify which type of representation they desired to describe the relationship between the boundary points and area for the figure. ",59,Connecting and Using Multiple Representations
60,Connecting and Using Multiple Representations,Students Reﬂ ect on Their Instruction Promoting Multiple Representations,60,Connecting and Using Multiple Representations
61,Connecting and Using Multiple Representations,"My students needed an opportunity to synthesize across the learning segment. At the end of day 7, I initiated a discussion with the question, “Why are multiple representations important for doing math?” I intended for students to consider multiple representations as a set of interrelated mathematical representations instead of as single representations. ",61,Connecting and Using Multiple Representations
62,Connecting and Using Multiple Representations,"Peter’s hand shot into the air, “If you use more than one strategy for solving a problem, then you are really checking your work.” ",62,Connecting and Using Multiple Representations
63,Connecting and Using Multiple Representations,"I was excited by Peter’s comment  and the numerous “yeahs” that I heard following his statement. Peter and others recognized that when they use multiple representations to solve a problem, then they might be able to confi rm their result as being correct because they drew the same conclusion in different ways. Similarly, if two different representations yield different results, the discrepancy might prompt students to fi nd a third representation to check their results. ",63,Connecting and Using Multiple Representations
64,Connecting and Using Multiple Representations,"Liz added, “When I use more than one representation, it helps me to see  the big picture of what is happening.” I asked students if this made sense,  and Chrissie stated, “Like the table only shows me part of the problem. The equation works for any part of the function.” ",64,Connecting and Using Multiple Representations
65,Connecting and Using Multiple Representations,"Suzie added to Chrissie’s comment, “When we were doing the problem where we had to show the relationship, my table only could show a few steps. But the equation worked for all of the fi gures.” ",65,Connecting and Using Multiple Representations
66,Connecting and Using Multiple Representations,"Students’ responses confi rmed that  they not only understood the importance of using multiple representations but also perceived the connections between the different types of representations. Connecting back to my action research, I asked students to complete a postassessment that was identical to the preassessment (see the more4U supplementary materials). On average, students used two representations per item to arrive at the solution on the postassessment, which was an increase of one representation per item from the preassessment. The most common representation that students employed on the postassessment was still a table (41 percent), but they also fl exibly used graphs (32 percent) and equations ",66,Connecting and Using Multiple Representations

68,Connecting and Using Multiple Representations,"(27 percent). Additionally, the average postassessment score was 41 percent, which meant the average student solved at least one item. Previously, most students were unable to solve any item. I interviewed students following the postassessment just as before. Students shared many more ideas during this round of interviews. ",68,Connecting and Using Multiple Representations
69,Connecting and Using Multiple Representations,"Andy said, “When you know more than one way to answer a problem, you can always try a different approach if you are stuck.” This idea resonates with NCTM’s Principles to Actions (2014, p. 26):",69,Connecting and Using Multiple Representations

71,Connecting and Using Multiple Representations,"Allison commented, “When you use more than one way, then it can help you to explain the problem better.” Allison’s statement suggests that if she were trying to explain her problem solving to another student and if she knew more than one way to represent her thinking, then she would be able to explain the problem in a way the other student might understand. Being able to explain something in more than one way is vitally important if students are expected to deepen their conceptual knowledge and foster others’ understanding.",71,Connecting and Using Multiple Representations
72,Connecting and Using Multiple Representations,LESSONS LEARNED FROM THIS ACTION RESEARCH,72,Connecting and Using Multiple Representations
73,Connecting and Using Multiple Representations,"The main conclusion I drew from my action research is that when students experience instruction about and with multiple representations, then they might perceive the benefi ts of using multiple representations during mathematical problem solving and develop a deeper understanding of underlying mathematical structures. Through students’ discussions and interviews, ",73,Connecting and Using Multiple Representations
74,Connecting and Using Multiple Representations,"I learned that they valued using more than one representation because it helped them make connections between concepts. During the task, students used multiple representations and justified their representational choices with peers during small- and whole-group instruction. Students were able to articulate why they chose certain representations and the benefits of using multiple representations while problem solving, which they could not do earlier. Opportunities for discussions were critical because they gave students the chance to share rationales for using specific representations and to listen to others’ ideas. Taken collectively, these conclusions align with NCTM’s (2014) suggestion that teachers allocate instructional time for students to work with multiple representations.",74,Connecting and Using Multiple Representations
75,Connecting and Using Multiple Representations,"My recommendation for teachers  who want to help students learn about and with multiple representations is to integrate worthwhile mathematical tasks that prompt students to use two or more representations (NCTM 2007). Worthwhile mathematical problems often encourage students to think with multiple representations during problem solving. Students who engage in worthwhile tasks benefit from problem solving through different representations. Incorporating worthwhile tasks into instruction gives students opportunities to gain greater facility with multiple representations while working independently. Moreover, during small- and wholegroup discussions, they might listen to peers’ ideas and assimilate those strategies into their future problem solving. Students have to reflect on why they choose to employ those representations and communicate their ideas in clear, effective ways that others might understand.

I found that through this learning segment, students were able to find purpose in the mathematics they were using and could more clearly understand the concepts we discussed in class.
