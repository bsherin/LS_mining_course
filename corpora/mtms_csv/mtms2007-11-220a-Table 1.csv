"Gearing Up  for Mathematics [M]ore low-income families will be well-informed of postsecondary options and financial aid, and take the steps necessary for admission into an institute of higher education. With GEAR UP, more low-income students will go to college and succeed. (Silver, n.d.)",2,mtms2007-11-220a,,
"Research has shown that taking rigorous mathematics courses at the high school level is one of the main predictors of being accepted into college and achieving success. In the last few years, much attention has been focused on getting low-income students to take higher-level courses, as they are the least likely group to do so. Strong evidence suggests that the key to success in such an endeavor is early intervention. Taking algebra in middle school is considered the gateway to completing advanced mathematics courses in high school. In fact, lowincome students who take algebra by the eighth grade are three times more likely to take these advanced mathematics courses in high school and, hence, attend college (U.S. Department of Education 1997). ",3,mtms2007-11-220a,,
"Many programs funded by the government establish partnerships between middle schools that serve a low-income population and universities, including Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs (GEAR UP), the Early Scholars Outreach Program, and Project GRAD. The aim of such programs is to increase the number of students from low-income families enrolled and participating competitively in a college-preparatory curriculum by the time the students reach the ninth grade. In particular, GEAR UP grants, awarded by the U.S. Department of Education since 1999, are available to partnerships including at least one institution of higher education, one middle school with students in low-income communities, and two community entities (such as businesses or philanthropic organizations). Recipients of these six-year grants begin working with eligible seventh graders and continue to provide services for the group through high school. The grant pays for activities that help the group members prepare for college,  charlotte simmons, charlottekaye@ aol.com, and Jesse Byrne, jbyrne@ ucok.edu, both teach in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Central Oklahoma in Edmond, OK 73003.",4,mtms2007-11-220a,,

"d. Use the totals from parts (a), (b) and (c) to help you determine the approximate cost of your first year of college.  *Remember that part (a) and part (c) are the costs for only one semester.",16,mtms2007-11-220a,,
"Question 2: Now that you have determined how much it will cost to go to school the first year, you are going to have to figure out how to pay for it. The options for finding money to pay your costs include applying for grants and scholarships and using the work-study program.",17,mtms2007-11-220a,,
"A few of the possible grants are the Pell Grant, maximum award $3300, average award $1500; and the Tuition Aid Grant ",18,mtms2007-11-220a,,
"Program, maximum award $1000. A possible scholarship is the Higher Learning Access Program, which is a full-tuition scholarship. For a list of other possible scholarships, see the easel in front of the Scholarship Office. Notice also the Fern Brown Memorial Scholarship and the National Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution State Scholarship. Would you qualify for any of these? Is there anything you could do to increase your likelihood of receiving one of these scholarships? a. Assume that you receive the average Pell Grant amount and that you also receive the Higher Learning Access Program scholarship that pays for your tuition for the two semesters. How much more money do you need to earn to pay for the first year? b. The final possible way to earn money for the first year is to apply for the Federal Work Study program. If you are  eligible, this program will provide you with a job on campus. The job pays minimum wage, and you are restricted to working a maximum of 20 hours a week. How many hours a week must you work, if the minimum wage is $5.15 per hour, to pay for the rest of your expenses? (Remember that you have to pay tax, so you will actually only earn $4.38 per hour. Also keep in mind that there are approximately 32 weeks of school.)",19,mtms2007-11-220a,,
"Question 3: After determining the number of hours you have to work each week, you might think that you will not have time to study and enjoy the other aspects of college life. Ask yourself, “Is there another way to get the money I need?” The answer is yes. You can apply for a student loan that will not need to be paid back until after you graduate.  a. Locate the payment schedule displayed outside the Financial Aid Office. What would your monthly payment be if you  decided not to work but instead borrowed $2,500 each of the four years that you are in college?   Borrowing money to go to college may not seem like the right thing to do because you will be coming out of college in debt. To ease your mind, go to the Career Placement Center. Use the information provided to see the advantage of taking out loans and attending college.  b. You want to compare the annual salaries for several of the occupations listed, but the salaries are listed as hourly. ",20,mtms2007-11-220a,,

"Question 4: Consider the following question. To qualify for many of the scholarships. you have to obtain a certain grade point average (GPA). A GPA can be computed as follows: You get 4 points for each A, 3 points for each B, 2 points for each C, and 1 point for each D. Add your total number of points, then divide by the number of courses. For example, if your grades were A, B, C, B, C, D, then your GPA would be  4+3+2+3+2+1 15 =2.5",30,mtms2007-11-220a,,
"Suppose you want to qualify for a scholarship where the minimum GPA is 2.75 and your grades are the following: 3 A’s, 8 B’s, 8 C’s, and 2 D’s. Calculate your GPA and see if you would qualify for the scholarship. If your GPA is not high enough, what minimal grade changes would you need to make for your GPA to be high enough to qualify for the scholarship?  such as tutoring (often provided by university students from the partner institution), mentoring, career exploration programs, and ACT prep courses; in addition, scholarship funds are available to allow members of the group to attend college after graduating from high school.",31,mtms2007-11-220a,,
" A key component of the GEAR UP program is to provide opportunities for group members to participate in activities on a college campus that are designed to convince them (and their parents) that attending college is a possibility. Since 61 percent of low-income middle school students indicate their intention to take as few mathematics courses as allowed (U.S. Department of Education 1997), university partners are strongly encouraged to include a mathematics component in the GEAR UP on-campus experience. Often it is the junior faculty members in the mathematics department who are called on to design such an activity. Faced with this somewhat daunting task, we designed a “math trail.”",32,mtms2007-11-220a,,
"A math trail is like an obstacle  course. Students stop at various locations around campus, and instead of climbing a wall or rope, they answer a mathematics question pertaining to that location. The questions for our math trail were designed with four objectives in mind: (1) to show students the realworld applications of the mathematics they are learning, (2) to reinforce the concepts learned in their mathematics classes, (3) to expose students to a college campus, and (4) to demystify the administrative process of entering college and make them aware of the financial aid that is available. (See fig. 1 for a sample of our GEAR-UP math trail questions.) For example, one of the questions asks students to “register” for classes, select a room and board plan, “buy” their books, and then compute their total cost for attending college the first year. Another question asks students to determine the number of hours per week they would need to work at their work-study job to pay the remaining part of their bill after the scholarships and grants have been applied.",33,mtms2007-11-220a,,
"Since the first math trail was held in Toronto in 1996, many other programs have sprung up in such locations as Copley Square in downtown Boston, Niagara Falls, the Smithsonian Institution, and other sites. The common theme of all such trails is to help students connect the concepts that they have learned in the classroom with the real world (in accordance with the NCTM’s Principles and Standards for School Mathematics (2000)). Additionally, our questions had to meet the criteria of the GEAR UP program. For instance, our trail sent participants to the Financial Aid Office to learn which scholarships, grants, and loans are available and made them aware of the criteria used in awarding them and what they need to be doing now to receive them. For example, most scholarships have a GPA requirement and are given to well-rounded students who have been involved in extracurricular activities that have a service component. ",34,mtms2007-11-220a,,
"In conjunction with GEAR UP,  approximately 400 at-risk middle  school students followed our math trail throughout our campus. Although it is too early to tell what long-term effects the trail will have on participants, feedback from students, teachers, and parents has been very encouraging. ",35,mtms2007-11-220a,,
"This program, promoting partnerships among universities, the public school systems, and the community, could be an ideal opportunity for junior faculty members to get involved in community service. We have found the community at-large to be supportive of our efforts; in fact, many local firemen and parents participated as trail guides. Those considering implementing such a trail will find Schneider, Pollak, and Shoaf (2005) useful in the planning stages.",36,mtms2007-11-220a,,
