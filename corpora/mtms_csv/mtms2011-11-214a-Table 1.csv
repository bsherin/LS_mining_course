Design lightbulb questions for your students using these six simple methods.,1,mtms2011-11-214a,,
"the strongest math students have already been accelerated into more advanced courses. The most capable prealgebra students may not fall in the mathematically gifted category, but some do place into accelerated programs in higher grade levels and may even surpass students who accelerated early on. When I began teaching this prealgebra course, I wanted to ensure suffi cient challenge and give students the opportunity to think with greater depth and sophistication about the material. Students generally respond best to moderate challenge (Tomlinson 1999), so my goal was not to overwhelm students with overly diffi cult brain teasers or puzzles but to offer them manageable problem-solving opportunities that were connected with the daily content. I also wanted to include enough differentiation so that each student could fi nd his or her own stopping point in the lesson.",2,mtms2011-11-214a,,

"I could not find a textbook containing a wealth of such sophisticated problems, so I began to make up extra problems for each lesson. Some of the problems were assigned as required material for all students, and other problems were given as optional bonus work on the homework. I eventually started calling these bonus items “lightbulb problems.” Every time the students saw a lightbulb icon next to an item, they knew it was a challenge problem that was optional and worth a modest amount of extra credit. I now typically give about four lightbulb problems per homework set, which are worth 5 percent each. This means ",6,mtms2011-11-214a,,
Any topic can be  made nonroutine by the nature of the  questioning.,7,mtms2011-11-214a,,
"that if a student gets 90 percent on the required part of the homework and correctly solves three bonus problems, his grade for that homework set is 105 percent. No bonus problems are available on tests or quizzes.",8,mtms2011-11-214a,,

"Maria has a rectangular vegetable garden with a 20 foot length and a  12 foot width. She increases the garden’s length by 40 percent and its  width by 25 percent. What is the percent increase in the garden area? recognized as viable differentiation techniques (Bray 2009; Powers 2008). Daily homework sets that contain more demanding problems even though not required allow the teacher to provide challenge without incurring undue stress. The modest incentive of some homework bonus points is enough to whet the appetite of students. The lightbulb problems allow dedicated students, for whom quick thinking and problem solving may not come as easily in a test situation, the chance to work on less routine problems at their own pace. However, those students who find the required material sufficiently difficult generally leave the optional problems alone, whereas the students who work most frequently on the optional challenges are usually the ones who already have an A or an A- in the course. ",12,mtms2011-11-214a,,
"I collect and grade the lightbulb  problems every day and make sure to return them the next day. Providing challenge in regular, small doses with immediate feedback plays an essential motivating role. Collecting enrichment material less frequently can sometimes lead to student procrastination (DeYoung 2001). Further, some high-ability students enjoy process more than closure, leaving a trail of unfinished work when the scope of what they work on becomes large (Rayneri, Gerber, and Wiley 2006). Regular success, on a smaller and more frequent scale, works well for many students.",13,mtms2011-11-214a,,
"An important feature of the lightbulb problems is their connection to the day’s lesson. The questions have immediate relevance to the daily content, and students are equipped with an appropriate foundation to solve the problems. By design, students need to devise their own method to solve the problems. The classic definition of problem solving (Pólya 1957) involves students making decisions and formulating their own plan to solve the  problem. With the lightbulb problems, the teacher steps back and lets the students own the process. Allowing students to struggle with problem solving remains counterintuitive in some schools and to some parents, more so in the United States than in other countries (Hiebert and Wearne 2003). If we want students to be able to think independently and critically, with some depth and sophistication, we have to be willing to give them some nonroutine problems without a prescribed algorithm.",14,mtms2011-11-214a,,

"The aim is to strike a balance with  problem might read:   If a car is being driven 45 miles east and then 60 miles north, what is the car’s distance from its starting point?   If a car is being driven 80 miles east, then 30 miles south, then 35 miles west, then finally 90 miles north, what is the car’s distance from its starting point? ",18,mtms2011-11-214a,,
"The car returns to the same location as in the first problem, but students must first determine that location by sketching or imagining the path of the journey. (The answer is 75 miles.) ",19,mtms2011-11-214a,,
"The added components require insight and decision making: In the enlarged garden problem, Sydney must recognize that two different percent changes combine to form another percent change. In the car trip problem, students must recognize that many legs of a journey can be combined to form two legs of a right triangle.",20,mtms2011-11-214a,,
questions that have some sophistication and yet are manageable for the most capable students in a course that is not accelerated. The spirit of the challenge problems is to nudge students in new directions from the day’s lesson and to ask for creativity and thoughtfulness in new situations. I have devised six ways to design lightbulb problems; each example is illustrated with work from my students who solved them.,21,mtms2011-11-214a,,
1. add More coMponents,22,mtms2011-11-214a,,
"Adding more components to a problem can help increase the complexity of a question. A typical percentchange problem might read:   If an $80 pair of sneakers is marked down to $55, what is the percent decrease in price? ",23,mtms2011-11-214a,,
"One lightbulb problem designed for percent-change lessons adds a component from two-dimensional geometry: finding the area of rectangles from linear dimensions. The student determines the percent increase in area after enlarging each of the original dimensions of a rectangle by a given percent. In figure 1, Sydney studies an enlarged rectangular garden. Percent changes in garden length and width are given, along with the original length and width. Sydney calculates the original ",24,mtms2011-11-214a,,
One lightbulb problem adds integer addition to the content of the Pythagorean theorem by including three or more legs of a journey:  2. integrate content,25,mtms2011-11-214a,,

4. increase technical difﬁ culty,33,mtms2011-11-214a,,
Simplify.,34,mtms2011-11-214a,,
"2+ 2+ 2+ 2+2 should combine different content from throughout the year (Beigie 2008). In fi gure 2, Henry combines fractal patterns with probability. He calculates the probability of a grain of sand landing on the shaded area of a rug with a square carpet fractal design. (See Peitgen et al. 1991 for an introduction to this fractal problem.) Area and percentage calculations for geometric probability are thus joined with pattern recognition for different-size squares in the fractal design. The earlier enlarged garden problem combines percents with two-dimensional geometry. The car trip problem  combines integer addition with the Pythagorean theorem, since the length of the right triangle’s legs is calculated by integer addition along the east-west direction and north-south direction. Integrating content can turn routine single-topic questions into genuine problem-solving opportunities in which students have to make decisions to combine more than one technique to form a coherent solution.",35,mtms2011-11-214a,,
3. ForeshadoW the Future,36,mtms2011-11-214a,,
"Some students can anticipate what will come next in the curriculum without direct instruction. Providing  students with an opportunity to discover ideas helps them view math as a creative process and gain a deeper mastery of the subject. In fi gure 3, Danica solves a lightbulb problem during a circle circumference lesson in which students calculate the area paved by a cylindrical steamroller making twenty revolutions. Danica recognizes that the paved area is a rectangle with a length equal to twenty times the circumference of the steamroller’s circular base. This problem foreshadows a topic to be addressed later in the course: fi nding the full surface area of a cylinder. Because students often having diffi culty viewing the lateral surface of a cylinder as a rectangular region, this problem provides a real-world context that  helps students visualize this area.",37,mtms2011-11-214a,,
"Good examples of prealgebra problems that foreshadow future topics anticipate the algebraic reasoning that students will be using in future math classes. Solving elementary linear algebraic equations is a standard part of any prealgebra curriculum. Teaching this skill early in the year allows me to frame some lightbulb problems in algebraic contexts. For example, students must often determine the surface area of a rectangular box, given its length, width, and height. A good lightbulb problem involves a cereal box in which the length, height, and surface area are known, but the width is unknown. Solving for the missing width gives students the opportunity to anticipate the power of algebra as a tool that can be used to solve problems. Ample opportunity also exists to foreshadow algebraic technique. For example, when teaching the distributive property,  3(2x + 7) = 6x + 21, the algebraic concept of factoring is previewed when asking Distributive Jeopardy lightbulb questions: What distributive property question has  22x + 77 as an answer? In other words, fill in the blank:  ______________ = 22x + 77 (Answer: 11(2x + 7)) 4. increase technical diFFiculty",38,mtms2011-11-214a,,
"For problems involving mechanical skills—fractions, integers, order of operations, percents, elementary algebra, and so on—some students are able to handle much more technically difficult problems and enjoy the added challenge. In figure 4, Andrew simplifies a nested square-root expression that is a lightbulb problem for a lesson on square roots. I try to produce more technically demanding questions that ",39,mtms2011-11-214a,,
"Fig. 5 Amanda and Alex use different methods to solve a nonroutine statistics  question based on the current lesson: Amanda uses guess and check (a), whereas  Alex uses elementary algebra (b).",40,mtms2011-11-214a,,

Find three numbers such that their mean is 10 times as large as their  median. Explain your reasoning.,42,mtms2011-11-214a,,
(a) Amanda (b) Alex do not simply lead to more calculations but contain some elegance. A pattern in the nesting of the squareroot signs gives an appealing outcome.,43,mtms2011-11-214a,,
" Computations in many traditional exercises can be augmented and made more involved. For example, when  we are working on integers, students have an opportunity to revisit sophisticated order of operations problems by incorporating negative numbers. My favorite computational challenges, however, tend to force students to step outside the problem and ask what are ",44,mtms2011-11-214a,,

6. go beyond Formulas,46,mtms2011-11-214a,,
"The shaded bands continue all the way around the 30 in. × 12 in. × 9 in. gift box. What is the total area of the shaded region on the surface of the box? the rules, such as when simplifying the complex fraction below:  1 2+1 2 1 2 (Answer: 2 1/5)  5. go Beyond Methodology",47,mtms2011-11-214a,,
"Homework sets can become dull when limited to simple application and mastery of a learned method. Good lightbulb problems often ask students to go beyond the methodology of a lesson, whether by taking a small step further or coming up with  a different approach. Figure 5 shows two student solutions to the problem of fi nding three numbers whose mean is ten times as large as their median. In addition to applying the lesson’s methods to compute median and mean, students must develop a strategy to discover three numbers that satisfy the condition. Amanda tries a popular guess-and-check approach. Alex decides to incorporate some elementary algebra.",48,mtms2011-11-214a,,
"Any topic can be made nonroutine by the nature of the questioning. For example, basic fractional calculations engender a lightbulb problem when students are asked to fi nd the simpli- fi ed fraction that is one-fourth of the way between 3/4 and 1 7/20 on the number line. (Answer: 9/10) The challenge is not in the technical diffi culty of the problem but in how to set up the calculation.",49,mtms2011-11-214a,,
6. go Beyond ForMulas,50,mtms2011-11-214a,,
"When learning geometry, student understanding should not be merely formulaic. My opening lesson on the surface area of cylinders and rectangular prisms is informal, with students discovering formulas through openended explorations of soup cans and cereal boxes. Once students are equipped with formulas, I like to present new situations that ask them to go beyond the formulas. ",51,mtms2011-11-214a,,
"In fi gure 6, Sophia calculates the  area of the shaded region on the surface of a box. As done with the surface area of the box, she breaks the problem down into pairs of faces: left and right, front and back, top and bottom. The area calculation for each face, however, involves breaking the shaded bands into three separate regions. As with the previous question, students produce a variety of methods to solve the problem. Another approach is to subtract the area of the eight identical, unshaded regions from the surface area of the entire box.",52,mtms2011-11-214a,,
"There are plenty of opportunities to put a twist on a standard problem to ask students to go beyond the formula: for example, slicing a cylindrical block of cheese into eighths (like slicing a pizza) and asking for the surface area of one piece.",53,mtms2011-11-214a,,
"conclusion These six suggestions for designing lightbulb problems can apply to any activity or problem that one might give to students. However, I have found that a key ingredient for successfully incorporating challenge into daily practice is to provide  some component of choice. Having all students attempt the same level of critical thinking and problem solving, while ensuring that no student incurs undue stress or struggle, will necessarily leave some students underchallenged. Giving students daily optional challenge problems, connected with the day’s material, helps ensure that every student has the opportunity to reach his or her own limit. Allowing student choice helps ensure that no child is left unchallenged.",54,mtms2011-11-214a,,
