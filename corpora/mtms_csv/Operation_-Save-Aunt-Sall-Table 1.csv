1,Operation_ Save Aunt Sally - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Both NCTM (2000) and the Common Core (2010) place importance on algebra and algebraic thinking in grades 5 through 8. Proficiency with order of operations is expressed for grade 5 as being able to ""use parentheses, brackets, or braces in numerical expressions and evaluate expressions with these symbols"" (CCSSM 2010, p. 35).",,
2,Operation_ Save Aunt Sally - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In grade 6, students should be able to ""perform arithmetic operations, including those involving whole-number exponents, in the conventional order when there are no parentheses to specify a particular order"" (p. 44). In grades 7 and 8, the rules of order of operations are used to simplify progressively complicated expressions and in solving equations (CCSSM 2010). Students are frequently offered the age-old mnemonic Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally (PEMDAS) to help them remember the order of operations.",,
3,Operation_ Save Aunt Sally - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Alternative approaches to instruction and remediation can mitigate the fatigue that students may feel regarding topics that have been discussed in previous classes. Although most adolescents entering middle school can quote the PEMDAS mnemonic (or a variation) verbatim, remembering its form is not equivalent to conceptual understanding or proficiency with its function. As a means of re-introducing and reinforcing proficiency with the order of operations, we present a game called Operation: Save Aunt Sally.",,
4,Operation_ Save Aunt Sally - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,THE GAME PREMISE,,
5,Operation_ Save Aunt Sally - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Your Aunt Sally is a bit of a rogue and is often getting into trouble. What you did not know until now is that Aunt Sally is really a secret agent on a special mission to retrieve a stolen microchip. She has been captured by enemy agents and is being held in an undisclosed location. It is a race against time to find the secret hiding place of the enemy agents. Can you be the first to solve the clues left by Aunt Sally and find the enemy's secret hideout?,,
6,Operation_ Save Aunt Sally - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,The objective of the game is to rescue Aunt Sally.,,
7,Operation_ Save Aunt Sally - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,PREGAME PREPARATION,,
8,Operation_ Save Aunt Sally - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Prepare materials for each group of four players in advance.,,
9,Operation_ Save Aunt Sally - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,HOW TO PLAY,,
10,Operation_ Save Aunt Sally - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Players select a game piece and start at the HOME square on the game board. Aunt Sally has left encrypted clues as to her location in the form of the deck of 100 numbered clue cards with order of operations expressions on one side. Solutions range from 1 to 12. To decide which player goes first, the deck is shuffled and each player draws a clue card. The player drawing the highest-numbered clue card goes first. (All players keep this clue card for their first turn.) The remaining stack of clue cards is then placed facedown in the center of the board. The game begins when the first player evaluates the expression on his or her clue card. The player convinces the other players that the expression has been evaluated correctly. The result indicates the number of spaces to move along the game board during that player's turn.",,
11,Operation_ Save Aunt Sally - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"During the player's next turn, the player must choose the 
  n

  th clue card in the deck, where 
  n

  is the value of his or her last solution; that is, if the solution to the expression on his or her previous card was 6, the player must choose the 6th card in the deck and evaluate that expression. The first five cards are then placed at the bottom of the deck. After the first player completes his or her turn, that clue card is returned to the bottom of the deck and play continues with the player to the left. (Note: The length of time to complete a game can be reduced if students work on clue cards concurrently.
  

  Players do not need to wait until another player has finished working to begin evaluating the expression on their drawn clue card.)
  

  Along the way, players will encounter several special challenge spaces that will allow them to move ahead or go backward along the game board path.",,
12,Operation_ Save Aunt Sally - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"If a player is unable to correctly evaluate the expression on the clue card, or if another player challenges the solution and can prove that it is incorrect, the player cannot move on that turn. However, the player may choose to retry the same problem again on her or his next turn. A key card listing solutions to all clue cards is provided (see online), in case a dispute arises that cannot be resolved by the players. If a player decides not to retry a problem on the next turn, a new card is drawn as before-by choosing the 
  n

  th card in the deck equal to the player's most recent correct solution. Game play continues until one player circumnavigates the board and reaches the enemy agents' hideout. A player is not required to land on the Secret Hideout! square; if a player's move takes him or her ""past"" that square, the game is over, and that player is the winner.",,
13,Operation_ Save Aunt Sally - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,STUDENT REACTIONS,,
14,Operation_ Save Aunt Sally - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"During game play in the sixth-grade classroom of one of the authors, some groups decided to help one another evaluate their expressions. Instead of using their opponent's wrong answers to prevent them from moving their game piece, students in these groups began helping each other correct errors made during calculations. Other groups decided to work concurrently on their clue cards instead of waiting for each player to finish the card to ""speed up the game and let us play more than once this period,"" according to one student. These groups used the key card to check their work after each problem was finished.",,
15,Operation_ Save Aunt Sally - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Each group of sixth graders was able to complete at least two games in a thirty-minute time frame. Some students struggled because of the complexity of expressions they received, but peers in their group often assisted them. Of particular interest was the fact that allowing student groups, by consensus, to make subtle modifications to the game rules only enhanced student motivation during game play. In the process, students gained ownership of the game experience and made it their own. Although some groups had modified the rules, a high level of engagement was observed, with discussions regarding content dominating most of the student-led talk in each group.",,
16,Operation_ Save Aunt Sally - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,STUDENT REFLECTIONS,,
17,Operation_ Save Aunt Sally - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"When game play was complete, students were asked to evaluate their experience with the game and write a reflection. Most commented that the game was challenging but were quick to note that they enjoyed playing. The fact that they were more willing to grapple with complex expressions presented in the game as opposed to working on a written assignment or other types of lesson review resonated with several students. One student wrote, ""I think it was a funner way to learn & review math. Even though the problems were harder."" Another student wrote, ""To me this game was hard. This game was fun. This game was complicated. I liked the game because it was a good game."" A third student wrote, ""The game was fun except I think it hated me because I kept getting the hard cards and I lost but I like it better than lessons."" Students with higher-level skills also found something to motivate them. One of these students wrote:",,
18,Operation_ Save Aunt Sally - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,I really liked the format of this game. I'm really good at math so it was a breeze. The way you had to do a problem and then move that amount of spaces was fun. It was so mathematically appealing that I wanted to solve the problems on the cards my peers had in their hands.,,
19,Operation_ Save Aunt Sally - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,LESSON EXTENSIONS,,
20,Operation_ Save Aunt Sally - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"After the lesson (game play and reflections) was completed, several students suggested modifying the clue cards to make the game accessible to lower-level students. Some suggested making the expressions more challenging. Removing or adding to individual decks of clue cards can easily differentiate the content of the expressions. Additionally, more challenging expressions could progressively be integrated as students achieve mastery at each level. Another option would be to include clue cards where the solutions include negative integers. This would increase the challenge in playing the game because students would have to move backward when they encountered a negative solution; this option would also extend the class time needed to play to arrive at a game winner.",,
21,Operation_ Save Aunt Sally - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Once students are familiar and comfortable with the game, clue cards might be developed for content areas other than order of operations. Since the mechanics of game play would be familiar to students at this point, less time would be required for learning the new game.",,
22,Operation_ Save Aunt Sally - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,FROM MNEMONIC TO UNDERSTANDING,,
23,Operation_ Save Aunt Sally - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Recalling a mnemonic from elementary school is a far cry from being able to effectively apply it with fidelity. For example, students often enter middle school knowing times tables by rote but have difficulty seeing the connections between multiplication and addition. Methods of engaging students are needed to address the gaps that arise when student perceptions of their skills do not coincide with reality. Content gaming in the mathematics classroom provides a collaborative structure that engages students with their peers and creates classroom conversations about mathematics while deepening individual student thinking.",,
