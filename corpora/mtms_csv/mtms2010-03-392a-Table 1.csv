"As the complexity of mathematics increases, so do students’ struggles. This is particularly true when the study of mathematics expands from generalized arithmetic to algebra in the form of more advanced quantitative relationships and problem solving. The guess-and-check method can be used to analyze quantitative relationships frequently encountered in middlegrades word problems. It is a powerful problem-solving tool that can help develop quantitative reasoning and complex problem-solving skills by allowing students to “first identify relevant quantities and their relationships, rather than focusing on numbers  middle-grades mathematics and made several recommendations for prospective teachers to consider and employ when preparing to teach middlegrades math. Among other suggestions, they encourage teachers to— 1.  engage in a frequent analysis of  quantitative relationships so as to describe and represent embedded relationships; and  2.  emphasize sense making over merely applying rote computational strategies. ",4,mtms2010-03-392a,,
"Mathematicians, mathematics edu- cators, and policymakers are increasingly emphasizing the importance of algebra in the K−8 curriculum. One key component of the NCTM Algebra Standard is that students should be able to “use mathematical models to represent and understand quantitative relationships” (NCTM 2000, p. 39).

Sowder et al. (1998) carefully  examined multiplicative structures in ,6,mtms2010-03-392a,,
"The development of such skills in teachers can potentially influence how  within a word problem. This information will help them— 1.  develop a conceptual sense-making  strategy for approaching word problems; and  2.  find a solution to the problem, or, if appropriate, develop an equation to represent the quantitative structure depicted in the word problem. ",7,mtms2010-03-392a,,
"As it implies, guess and check is a strategy in which students guess a value for the unknown component of a word problem, then check whether their guessed value satisfies the conditions of the problem. Guess and check is as much about developing mathematical reasoning and problem solving as it is about finding a correct solution. ",8,mtms2010-03-392a,,
"This strategy is not a prescribed process for students to follow. It is a skillful art and exploratory problem-solving technique that needs to be experienced and developed. Although it does not follow a prescribed algorithm, the guess-and-check method can be aided by a logical progression of steps that is part of the process (see fig. 1). As students become more skilled applying this strategy, they may modify the approach or develop their own way of applying it.",9,mtms2010-03-392a,,
"Students start by clarifying the  connections between the information they are given and the unknown component they are trying to find. They can begin their guess-and-check table  many students resort to a “key  word” approach, superficially categorizing word problems and solution approaches rather than understanding the underlying relations within the problem. For example, students will remember to solve distance problems by plugging numbers into d = rt rather than understanding the relative relationship of values given in the question. Another problem arises from students’ direct translation of the words they read into mathematical statements rather than an analysis of the mathematical relations implied (Wagner and Parker 1993). For example, “Bob has three times as many books as Mary,” often gets translated as 3B = M instead of B = 3M.",10,mtms2010-03-392a,,

"I have found guess and check to be an effective strategy in helping students overcome their difficulties in understanding the quantitative relationships within a word problem, because it allows them to translate everyday language into mathematical language. By arranging “guesses” and accompanying work in a table, students are creating an organizational tool that will help them dissect the numerical relations ",12,mtms2010-03-392a,,

Word ProbleMs can be Word ProbleMs,19,mtms2010-03-392a,,
"One of the earliest and most prolific experiences that students have with variables, symbols, equations, and algebraic reasoning is the dreaded word problem. How many times have teachers heard the mutterings, “I hate word problems!” as soon as a problem involves words and sentences rather than symbols and numbers? Students may have encountered word problems as early as first grade in the form of pattern generalization problems. However, an emphasis on symbols and abstraction is not often encouraged until the upper elementary or early middle grades. At this level, “not knowing what the problem says, not understanding what the problem means, and not recognizing how to do the problem” (Ponce and Garrison 2004, p. 256) can lead to students’ frustration. ",20,mtms2010-03-392a,,
"The importance of word problems in the development of algebraic thinking at all grade levels cannot be underestimated. One difficulty stems from converting everyday language into mathematical language (Wagner and Parker 1993). To address this,  by guessing a value for the unknown component. Students need to ask themselves these questions:",21,mtms2010-03-392a,,
"Fig. 2 The word problem in (a) employs guess and check. however, since no variables are used, alternative symbolic representations will be required. The table in (b) shows the student’s thinking.  •	 What	information	is	given?	 •	 What	am	I	trying	to	find?	 •	 What	do	I	need	to	know	before	I	 can do anything else? ",22,mtms2010-03-392a,,
"Once students have made a guess, they build the other columns in their table by using their guessed value to determine the rest of the numerical relations within the word problem. Students can then ask themselves: •	 What	is	the	relationship	between	 the quantities in the word problem?  •	 Now	that	I	have	made	a	guess,	 what do I know? ",23,mtms2010-03-392a,,
"The final step will require students to check their calculated solution with the information provided in the problem and add it to the table. If the guess led to an incorrect answer, students should reassess their guess and refine it to make a better choice the second and following times. They must then ask themselves: •	 How	can	I	use	the	results	from	my	 previous guess to make a better guess?  •	 How	do	I	know	if	my	next	guess	 should be greater or less than my previous guess? ",24,mtms2010-03-392a,,
"Finally, students know that they have solved the problem when a guess leads to a correct solution.",25,mtms2010-03-392a,,
"The following examples demonstrate students’ thought processes involved in making sense of the numerical relations within a problem and building a table (see fig. 2). Notice that these examples are presented in such a way that the guessing and checking advance from a solutionfinding strategy in figure 2, in which no variables are used, to a tool that  coby is building a rectangular playpen for his dog, Max. he has 48 feet of fencing and plans to make the length of the pen 6 feet longer than the width. What will be the dimensions of Max’s playpen? 1. What information have i been given to work with?   answer: The perimeter of the pen.",26,mtms2010-03-392a,,
"2. What am i trying to find?   answer: The length and width of the playpen.  3. To find length, i first need to know the width. i will begin by guessing a  value for width.",27,mtms2010-03-392a,,
4. build the table.    a. Guess a value for width (w).,28,mtms2010-03-392a,,
  b. use the value guessed for width to find length (l = w + 6).,29,mtms2010-03-392a,,
  c.  use the values for width and length to find the perimeter  (P = 2(w + 6) + 2w).,30,mtms2010-03-392a,,
  d. check the value for perimeter against the given value of 48 feet.,31,mtms2010-03-392a,,
"5. if the solution is incorrect, determine if it is too high or too low and adjust  for the next guess accordingly.  (a) (b) enables them to construct meaning from the word problem through a symbolic representation.",32,mtms2010-03-392a,,
"As students become skilled at  using guess and check to find solutions, they can then use the process to  find an equation that represents the problem situation. Instead of guessing numerical values, students select a variable to represent the unknown quantity and build the rest of the table. They can use the final column  of the table (the actual columns used will depend on the problem) to write the equation. ",33,mtms2010-03-392a,,
"Notice that the unknown value is inherently defined within the table itself. Early in this process of developing comfort with guess and check, some teachers find it helpful to have students guess numerical values first, create a table that is based on the numerical guess, solve the problem, and then select a variable to build an equation to model the problem (see fig. 3). Others argue that, although this process teaches students to write the equation, the students have no need for it since the problem has already been solved. However, in the middle-grades Algebra Standard, NCTM states:",34,mtms2010-03-392a,,
"Students’ facility with symbol manipulation can be enhanced if it is based on extensive experience with quantities in contexts through which students develop an initial understanding of the meanings and uses of variables and an ability to associate symbolic expressions with problem contexts. (NCTM 2000, p. 227)  Early on, students benefit from first  finding the number that satisfies the conditions of the problem and then using the table that has already been created to identify the unknown in the problem to build the equation. For students at this stage of development, being able to write an equation or rule and find the numerical solution is as important as understanding the connections between the concrete numerical and abstract symbolic representations of the word problem. Guess and check builds a bridge between finding a concrete solution to the problem and creating a more abstract equation to represent the problem. ",35,mtms2010-03-392a,,

Basic algebra “extends learners’ understanding of arithmetic and enables them to express arithmetical understandings as generalizations using variable notation” (KetterlinGeller et al. 2007, p. 68).

"Difficulties with algebra may  have more to do with the way that it has traditionally been taught rather than some inherent shortcoming within the field itself.

"It is important for students to experience the need for, and appreciate the usefulness of, guess and check rather than learn it as a procedural algorithm. Part of this problem-solving process is understanding when it is the most useful tool to employ and when it is not.  they may no longer need to use this strategy. It is hoped that the thought processes associated with reading and making sense of word problems and the conceptual understanding needed to break a word problem down into workable and understandable numerical relations will become habits. In so doing, students will need to rely less and less on this strategy. However, for many students, this strategy may be their most powerful tool as they develop an understanding of variables, use symbolic representations of verbal or written statements, and learn how to write equations to represent a problem situation.

"Depending on the context in which  algebra is introduced and explored, it may take many forms, from generalized arithmetic, to the means for solving certain problems, to the study of relationships, to the study of structures (Usiskin 1988). However, if we argue that “algebra remains a vehicle for solving certain problems [and] provides the means by which to describe and analyze relationships” (Usiskin 1988, p. 18), then part of our algebra instruction must include a conceptually based investigation of real-world problems that uses mathematical language in the form of symbols, variables, expressions, and equations. The use of these most basic algebraic structures is an integral part of helping students reason abstractly and think algebraically. Fostering algebraic thinking through guess and check promotes this effective way of thinking and generates success with algebraic representations.",60,mtms2010-03-392a,,
"conclusion The NCTM Algebra Standard states that instructional programs at the middle grades should enable students to “represent and analyze mathematical situations and structures using algebraic symbols” (2000, p. 222). Guess and check is a powerful problem-solving strategy that can connect a conceptual understanding of word problems with a symbolic representation. It also encourages independent judgment in the development of number sense. ",61,mtms2010-03-392a,,
"Ketterlin-Geller et al. (2007) state that “students need to learn to break the problem into separate parts and then convert each part to an expression or equation that acknowledges the restrictions that the problem places on it” (p. 70). The guess-and-check strategy not only helps students find solutions to word problems, but also creates a habit of mind that enables them to successfully separate and translate the different parts of a word problem into mathematical equations. This approach to solving word problems encourages reflection on the original problem, development of an algebraic statement, and determination of the reasonableness of a solution. This strategy can be used at any grade level and can easily be adapted to the mathematical skills, fluency, and maturity of your students. ",62,mtms2010-03-392a,,
