1,Odd Shape Out - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The Odd Shape Out task was an open-ended problem that engaged students in comparing shapes based on their properties. Four teachers submitted the work of 116 students from across the country. Teacher Walter Stark noted that to solve this problem,",,
2,Odd Shape Out - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,My students would be forced to apply their knowledge of geometry and math vocabulary to choose which figure was different from the rest. I am always trying to impress upon my students how important it is to not only be able to apply their math knowledge but use the proper vocabulary when explaining it.,,
3,Odd Shape Out - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"As students were doing what Stark noted, they were using many of the Common Cores Standards for Mathematical Practice (SMP), in particular, SMP 6 (using precise vocabulary) and SMP 7 (seeing structure among the shapes). As students compared their answers and debated the validity of other points of view, they were also engaging in SMP 3 (making arguments and critiquing the reasoning of others) (CCSSI 2010).",,
4,Odd Shape Out - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The work of Gabrielle, a fifth-grade student in Starks class, was a good example of a student clearly explaining why shape 3 could be the odd shape out (see fig. 1). Her work also showed a precise use of vocabulary (SMP 6) and offered a careful and correct argument for her choice (SMP 3).",,
5,Odd Shape Out - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
6,Odd Shape Out - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Rylie, a sixth-grade student in Rebecca Laytons class, worked on the solution seen in figure 2.",,
7,Odd Shape Out - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
8,Odd Shape Out - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Rylie clearly reasoned a way, supported by visuals, that shape 2 could be the odd shape out. In addition to answering the initial question (Which shape could be the odd shape out?), many students also attempted the extension question, in which they were asked to describe a way that each shape could be the odd shape out. Malina, a sixth-grade student in Julie Clarks class, solved the problem and its extension (see fig. 3).",,
9,Odd Shape Out - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
10,Odd Shape Out - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Malina initially chose shape 3 as the odd shape out but then continued to give reasons why every other shape could also be the shape that did not fit. In her work, Malina considered lengths of sides, angles, parallel lines, and symmetry.",,
11,Odd Shape Out - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Ashley, an eighth-grade student of Tara Maynard, also offered reasons why each shape could be the odd shape out (see fig. 4).",,
12,Odd Shape Out - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Fig. 4 Although Ashleys solution was brief, it nonetheless contained many geometric terms.",,
13,Odd Shape Out - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
14,Odd Shape Out - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Her work showed the correct use of the terms concave and convex, and also that she sorted the shapes based on their names rather than on specific attributes that they possessed. We assumed that Ashley was using the exclusive definition of trapezoid (a quadrilateral with exactly one pair of parallel sides). If not, then shapes 1 and 4 could also have been considered trapezoids. We assumed, as well, that her use of the term slanted meant not perpendicular.",,
15,Odd Shape Out - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"As students worked to determine reasons why each shape could be the odd shape out, most noticed attributes related to the properties of sides, angles, and symmetry. In contrast, several students focused on the area of the shapes, measuring side lengths and calculating areas.",,
16,Odd Shape Out - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Shape 3 (the concave kite) and shape 4 (the rectangle) were most often chosen as the odd shapes out. Along with students interesting and correct reasoning for each shape, there was a clear pattern of consistent incorrect or imprecise reasoning related to properties of these shapes. This consistency spanned all grade levels and classes of students in the work submitted. Below is a list of reasons that students gave for each shape being the odd shape out, along with a discussion of common incorrect or imprecise reasoning about each.",,
17,Odd Shape Out - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,SHAPE 1,,
18,Odd Shape Out - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Shape 1 (the parallelogram) was chosen as the odd shape out because it was the only example with the following:,,
19,Odd Shape Out - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"No lines of symmetry, or it doesnt match up when you fold it in half (Starks class: Aryk, Ajay, and Mavro; Clarks class: Malina; Laytons class: Hannah, Angelina, Cadin, Kayla, Hadley, Iris, Lilly and Jaylon; Maynards class: Nate and Ashleigh)",,
20,Odd Shape Out - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The largest area (Clarks class: Allison, Benjamin, Jaden, and Connor)",,
21,Odd Shape Out - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Slanted parallel sides (Clarks class: Allison; Maynards class: Skyler and Ashley),,
22,Odd Shape Out - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Two pairs of parallel sides and no right angles (Clarks class: Zayn),,
23,Odd Shape Out - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,The acute angles opposite (diagonal) from each other and the obtuse angles opposite (diagonal) from each other (Laytons class: Megan and Mason),,
24,Odd Shape Out - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"An analysis of this shape also showed some common incorrect or imprecise thinking. Some students thought that the parallelogram had a vertical line of symmetry. Cutting it out and folding it to check could have been a good way to see that it did not have symmetry. Others, although probably thinking correctly, used imprecise vocabulary by saying that the shape had four parallel sides rather than two pairs of parallel sides. A few students stated that this shape was the only one with two acute and two obtuse angles, neglecting to note that shape 2 also had this property but that the angles were adjacent rather than opposite from each other. One eighth-grade student perceptively noted that shape 1 had diagonals that bisected each other and formed two sets of two congruent triangles. This student did not, however, explain that shape 4 also had this property.",,
25,Odd Shape Out - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,SHAPE 2,,
26,Odd Shape Out - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Shape 2 (the isosceles trapezoid) was chosen because it was the only shape with these attributes:,,
27,Odd Shape Out - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Only one set of parallel sides (Starks class: Ajay; Clarks class: Benjamin and Roni; Laytons class: Conner; Maynards class: Victoria, Andrew, Ashleigh, Nate, and Skyler)",,
28,Odd Shape Out - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Only one set of sides the same length (Starks class: Aryk , Gabrielle, and Mavro; Clarks class: Allison, Malina, and Tyler; Laytons class: Abby, Chelsea, Mason, Rylie, Iris, Kaleca, and Joshua)",,
29,Odd Shape Out - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The comments about this shape showed that although students found fewer ways for this choice to be the odd shape out, there were also fewer examples of incorrect or imprecise reasoning, as well. A few students thought that this shape contained right angles, and other students saw this shape as being a portion of a triangle in which the top had been cut off. In general, students made fewer comments (correct or incorrect) about this shape.",,
30,Odd Shape Out - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,SHAPE 3,,
31,Odd Shape Out - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Shape 3 (the concave kite) was chosen because it was the only choice with these properties:,,
32,Odd Shape Out - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"No parallel sides (Starks class: Aryk, Jade, Gabrielle, Karissa, Mavro, and Esha; Clarks class: Katelyn, Malina, Benjamin, Jaden, Zayn, Tyler, Connor, and Brynn; Laytons class: Katie, Conley, Hannah, Lily, Mason, Jacob, Kayla, and Trista; Maynards class: Skyler and Victoria)",,
33,Odd Shape Out - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Two pairs of equal length sides next to each other (adjacent) instead of opposite of each other (Starks class: Gabrielle),,
34,Odd Shape Out - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,No horizontal sides (from Clarks class),,
35,Odd Shape Out - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Three acute angles and one obtuse angle, called a reflex angle (Clarks class: Brynn; Laytons class: Matthew and Jacob)",,
36,Odd Shape Out - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"No specific name, an unidentified quadrilateral (Laytons class: Kaylin and Madyson)",,
37,Odd Shape Out - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Concave (Maynards class: Andrew, Ashleigh, Ashley, and Nate)",,
38,Odd Shape Out - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"An analysis of this shape showed that although students saw many interesting and correct ways that this shape could be the odd shape out, they also had several common incorrect or imprecise ways of describing it. For example, many students stated that it was a triangle or had only three vertices/angles. Other students saw four vertices but only three angles. Some students said that the shape had four vertices and angles, but it reminded them more of a triangle than any of the other shapes. The students who only saw three angles were likely missing the large (greater than 180 degree) angle that caused the shape to be concave. This angle, called a reflex angle, is present in all concave shapes. It was not surprising that students were unfamiliar with the term, but it was important to note that a shape could be a quadrilateral even if it did not look like a well-known quadrilateral, such as a rectangle, square, parallelogram, or trapezoid. In fact, one student said, This shape doesnt look like a shape to me. Only eighth-grade students correctly named this shape as concave, and no student used the term kite.",,
39,Odd Shape Out - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,SHAPE 4,,
40,Odd Shape Out - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Shape 4 (the rectangle) was chosen because it was the only shape with these attributes:,,
41,Odd Shape Out - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Four right (90 degree) angles (Starks class: Jade, Ajay, Karissa, and Nailah; Clarks class: Allison, Malina, Benjamin, Samantha, Jolie, Roni, Zayn, Tyler, and Brynn; Laytons class: Megan, Hannah, Matthew, Mason, Melodi, Kayla, Roselin, Hadley, Ashlyn, Abby, and Mirella; Maynards class: Skyler, Victoria, Andrew, Ashleigh, and Nate)",,
42,Odd Shape Out - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,All sides either horizontal or vertical (Starks class: Aryk; Clarks class: Allison and Jolie; Laytons class: Megan and Blake),,
43,Odd Shape Out - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Two lines of symmetry (Starks class: Aryk and Nailah),,
44,Odd Shape Out - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,No acute angles (Starks class: Mavro and several other unidentified students),,
45,Odd Shape Out - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,It was a rectangle (Maynards class: Ashley),,
46,Odd Shape Out - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The comments for this shape showed that students were able to find multiple interesting attributes that made this choice the odd shape out. They also had relatively few ways of reasoning incorrectly or imprecisely about this shape. A few students thought that this was the only shape with two pairs of parallel sides. These students did not consider the slanted (nonvertical) sides in shape 1 as parallel. Interestingly, another student noticed the parallel sides in shape 1 but not in shape 4. One other student also noticed that shape 4 could be rotated to match itself (rotational symmetry), but did not explain that shape 1 also possessed that property.",,
47,Odd Shape Out - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"It is notable that nearly all students paid attention to such attributes as parallel sides and equal length sides; acute, right, and obtuse angles; and symmetry. These students were able to think about a variety of important geometric attributes pertaining to these particular shapes. Some students also attempted to draw broader generalizations using the names or definitions of the shapes. For example, several students claimed that shapes 1, 2, and 4 were all parallelograms. Although shape 4 (the rectangle) can accurately be described as a special kind of parallelogram, shape 2 (the isosceles trapezoid) did not have the required two pairs of parallel sides to fit that definition. One student attempted to draw a hierarchy diagram to show how parallelograms, rectangles, and isosceles trapezoids related to one another, accurately showing that all rectangles were parallelograms. If students were to use the inclusive definition of trapezoid (a quadrilateral with at least one pair of parallel sides), then all parallelograms are, in fact, isosceles trapezoids as well.",,
48,Odd Shape Out - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"This problem allowed for differentiation, as shown by the many different ways that students could decide which shape was the odd shape out. In addition, students from all middle school grade levels could access the problem. It also addressed several of the middle-grades content standards and several of the mathematical practices.",,
