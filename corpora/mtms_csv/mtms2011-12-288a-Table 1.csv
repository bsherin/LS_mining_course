"unfolding unfolding fraction icat sStudents often have diffi culty understanding fractions, in general, and understanding how to multiply fractions, in particular. To move past this potential problem area, students need to develop a deeper understanding of multiplication and connect the ideas to fractions. The Rational Number Project (RNP) has examined how to build meaning for fraction multiplication. Two recent teaching experiments were presented to sixth graders in a midwestern urban setting, and four questions guided the work on multiplication:  and Seth Leavitt sequenced?",0,mtms2011-12-288a,,

"For students to understand fraction multiplication, we believed that they should be able to apply meaning to the numbers being operated on and have a sense of what happens to the numbers when they are multiplied. We knew that estimation must be part of this vision of fraction multiplication. However, students’ previous work with multiplication in the context of repeated addition or iteration would not help them estimate the product of 4/5 and 2/3.",6,mtms2011-12-288a,,
"The work that elementary-age  students do when multiplying whole numbers leads students too often to the belief that multiplication yields a larger amount. We realized that this belief would need to be challenged. We also wanted students to understand the formal algorithm for fraction multiplication. For us, that understanding meant that students could provide a rationale for multiplying numerators and denominators  to find the product and that this  rationale would be connected to a model of some kind.",7,mtms2011-12-288a,,

"We recognized that students would need to explore fraction multiplication using concrete and pictorial models and make connections among models, contexts, and symbols. Previous studies have shown that students who have extended experience working with concrete models develop strong mental images of fractions and use these mental images to support their estimation with fraction addition and subtraction (Cramer, Wyberg, and ",9,mtms2011-12-288a,,

"Using a Number Line: A Fraction × a Whole Number In our lessons, we initially asked students to use a number line to solve a problem involving two positive whole numbers. Students were given this task:   Joshkin makes $12 an hour. How much does he make in 4 hours of work?",13,mtms2011-12-288a,,
"Most of the students were able to explain that this problem could be solved using the multiplication sentence 4 × 12 = 48. The number line was originally divided into multiples of 12, and the students showed the iterative process by starting at $0 and making 4 jumps of $12, ending at $48. We changed the problem, again to be completed using the number line:   How much will Joshkin earn if he works for 3/4 of an hour? ",14,mtms2011-12-288a,,
"Without providing any direct instruction, we observed students as they solved this new task. The context of the problem allowed the students to make a reasonable estimate before they calculated the result. Most of the students were able to explain that ",15,mtms2011-12-288a,,
"Joshkin will earn less than $12, since he worked less than 1 hour. ",16,mtms2011-12-288a,,
"Students seemed to naturally  divide the $12 on the number line into fourths, with each fourth representing $3 (see fig. 1). They then made three jumps of $3 to determine their final answer of $9. The number line was a tool that made it easy for students to partition the $12 amount into fourths, then iterate the $3 intervals three times. The operation of multiplication moved from being a repeated-addition,  or iterative-only, process to both a partitioning and an iterative process. In so doing, the meaning for the fraction in this type of problem evolved from being a part-whole notion into an operator notion (Kieren 1980). The 3/4 changed from simply being 3 of 4 equal parts into operating on some amount by dividing by 4 and then multiplying this result by 3. ",17,mtms2011-12-288a,,
An interesting result of using a  number line to model multiplying a fraction by a whole number was the students’ re-interpretation of the fraction in the problem. Their understanding progressed from being a part-whole idea to an operator idea. We found that almost all the sixth-grade students in this study were able to successfully use the number line as a tool to make sense of fraction multiplication. These students viewed this partitioning and iterating process in the course of solving a problem related to finding a fractional part of a whole number.,18,mtms2011-12-288a,,

"Finding the product of two fractions was easy to do procedurally, but building meaning for this operation with two fractions was challenging. We were interested in finding a concrete or pictorial model for multiplying two fractions that would allow students to construct meaning for the algorithm and build mental images of the action connected to multiplying two fractions. These mental images would, in turn, support students’ ability to estimate the product of two fractions. ",21,mtms2011-12-288a,,
"In our first teaching experiment, we used the number line model as a tool. However, many students found it difficult to make sense of multiplying two fractions, as demonstrated by their thinking on this question:   Find the distance traveled by a person who runs 4/5 of a block that is 1/3 of a mile long. ",22,mtms2011-12-288a,,
"The context modeled 4/5 × 1/3. Many students were able to locate 4/5 of 1/3 on the number line, as shown in figure 2, by partitioning the distance from 0 to 1 into thirds and considering the length from 0 to 1/3 as the unit to be partitioned into 5 equal parts. They then identified 4 of those 5 equal parts, which matched the implied action embedded in the context. However, many students were unable to rename that amount using the unit of comparison as the length from 0 to 1 on the number line and stated that the answer was 4/5 mile instead of the correct answer of 4/15 mile. Students had difficulty being flexible with the unit when multiplying two fractions on the number line. ",23,mtms2011-12-288a,,

"To avoid students’ number-line difficulties in our second teaching experiment, we introduced multiplying two fractions using paper instead of a number line. We specifically used waxed patty paper, which comes in   5  1/2-inch squares. Figure 3 shows the steps involved in folding paper to find the product 2/3 × 1/4.",33,mtms2011-12-288a,,
"To model multiplication of two  fractions concretely, students needed to understand that how a fraction amount was named depends on the unit. Connecting the model to a context enabled students to make sense of  the changing unit at the various stages in the problem. In this problem, the unit changed. At the start of the problem, the full piece of paper was the unit, and the paper was folded and shaded to show 1/4. Then 1/4 of the paper was the unit to be partitioned into 3 equal parts, with 2 parts highlighted. Students needed to change the unit one more time, back to the original unit, the full sheet of paper, for the fi nal answer. Many students struggled with this fi nal step in the process when modeling the product of two fractions. Asking students to verbalize their actions using the paper and refl ect on the context helped them understand this fraction multiplication model. It also helped them see why the unit changed as they worked through the problem.",34,mtms2011-12-288a,,
"Students’ understanding of  multiplication and the meaning of a fraction kept expanding as they encountered different types of fraction multiplication tasks. When fi rst introduced to multiplying a fraction by a whole number, students re-interpreted from part-whole to operator. When students modeled the product of two fractions less than 1, they had to use both interpretations to make sense of the paper model because the meaning of each fraction in a multiplication sentence was different when using paper. ",35,mtms2011-12-288a,,
"The number 1/4 in the previous  example represented a part-whole interpretation of a fraction. At the start of the paper-folding activity, students needed to interpret 1/4 as 1 out of 4 equal parts. In the next step, students interpreted the 2/3 as an operator notion, just as they had done when multiplying a fraction by a whole number. They interpreted 2/3 by fi rst partitioning a new unit into 3 parts and highlighting 2 of those parts. The fi nal step involved re-interpreting that amount in comparison with the whole piece of paper, a part-whole idea. The  paper model clearly showed students that the product of two fractions less than 1 is less than both fractions in the problem. We found that using paper was a strong visual that helped students discern that multiplication did not always yield an amount larger than the numbers in the problem. ",36,mtms2011-12-288a,,
"The paper model also lends itself nicely to students understanding why the algorithm works. To build connections between the paper model and the multiplication algorithm, students solved several problems like 2/3 × 2/3 (see fi g. 4). We asked students to look for patterns among the number sentence, the picture of the paper, and the fi nal product. We asked these guiding questions within the activity and in the large-group discussion:  •  How many total parts are in the  picture of the paper? Why?  •  Where do you see a 3 × 3 rectangle  in the picture?  •  What does this amount represent? •  How many total parts are shaded  twice?  •  Where do you see a 2 × 2 rectangle  in the picture?  •  What does this amount represent?

Some students were able only to explain the connection between the denominator and the total number of parts shown in the paper.

"Using a Number Line: Multiplying Two Fractions When we developed the multiplication lessons, we believed that the fi nal step in the sequence would occur when students made sense of the algorithm. The paper model worked well for fi nding products of fractions with small numerators and denominators but became unwieldy when using fractions with larger numerators and denominators or with fractions greater than 1. The algorithm can be used effi ciently with any values in the numerator and denominator. We initially liked the number line model for multiplication of fractions because it extended students’ interpretation of a fraction from part-whole to operator. However, students in our fi rst teaching experiment found the number line diffi cult to use when they multiplied fractions like  ×or ×or or",41,mtms2011-12-288a,,
We noticed that students who could show the product using a number line were guided by knowing the actual answer ahead of time. So the number line model was not helping students build meaning for the algorithm.,42,mtms2011-12-288a,,
"We did not want to abandon the  number line model completely. In our second teaching experiment, we introduced this model for multiplying two fractions after students used the paper model and learned the multiplication algorithm. Therefore, our instruction  did not end with the algorithm. These students made sense of the number line model after learning the algorithm. It helped us realize that when students apply both their knowledge of fraction multiplication and a procedure to a new and somewhat challenging model, it can enhance and reinforce their understanding. When we sequenced the number line model to occur after the paper model and the development of the algorithm, most of the sixth graders in our second teaching experiment were able to successfully model multiplying a nonunit fraction by a unit fraction on a number line. However, students found it more difficult when multiplying two nonunit fractions.",43,mtms2011-12-288a,,
Using a Number Line: A Fraction × a Fraction The sixth graders struggled with using the number line to find the product  of two nonunit fractions to solve this problem:  Hannah hikes along the Nature Trail at Mud Lake.

"The most difficult part for students was trying to partition the two intervals representing 2/3 into 5 equal lengths (see fig. 5). Their experience with the paper and the algorithm helped them realize that they needed to partition the number line into fifteenths, which allowed students to find 4/5 of 2/3 in several creative ways on the number line.

"The 0, 1/3, 2/3, and 1 labels on the  bottom of the number line in Max’s  solution represented miles (see fig. 5). The first third was partitioned into fifths; eventually, the entire number line was partitioned into fifteenths. The fractional amounts between 0 and 1/3 on the bottom of the number line represented the amount of a block that Hannah walked. The equally spaced tick marks representing fifteenths of a mile were labeled on the top of the number line using whole numbers from 1 to 15. The first set of numerals 1, 2, 3, 4 written above the 1, 2, 3, . . . , 15 seemed to represent 4/5 of the first 1/3 mile. The next 1, 2, 3, 4 seemed to represent the second iteration of 4/5 of 1 mile. This notation represented the iteration of 4/5 of 1/3 two times.

He initially stated that Hannah had hiked 4/15 of 1 mile. When asked how this answer compared with the 8/15 he computed using the algorithm, he added information to his drawing.

We found a few other students who  had similar nonconnected paths on their number lines. This approach to iteration made sense of the meaning of the product of the numerators and the denominators.

"Drawing the number line as a  method for finding the product of two fractions had become an end in itself rather than simply another way to develop the algorithm.

It emphasized multiplication as both a partitioning and an iterating process.",55,mtms2011-12-288a,,
"The algorithm also supported the students’ efforts to make sense of how to partition the number line. Many students explained that the product of the denominators helped them decide how to determine the partitions. Several others used the result of the algorithm to check and make changes to their number line work. Many of the students explained that they knew they had the correct answer when the folded paper, the results of the algorithm, and the drawing of the number line all matched. We believe that students’ prior experiences with both the paper folding and the algorithm were crucial to their success in multiplying fractions using a number line.",56,mtms2011-12-288a,,
This article has presented a sequence of activities to help students develop a deeper understanding of multiplication as well as a more developed sense of fractions.
