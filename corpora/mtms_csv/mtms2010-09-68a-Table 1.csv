side the box on this task. ,13,mtms2010-09-68a,,
"Many began by looking at specific  sStudents worked both inside and out- cases. Christina, a student at Forestdale School, looked at a 3 × 3 grid with a 4 in the upper-left corner. As did many other students, she recognized that the value in the upper-left corner was 2 fewer than the value in the upperright corner. Similarly, the value in the lower-left corner was 2 fewer than the value in the lower-right corner. When the sums were formed, the larger number from the upper pair was added to the smaller number in the lower pair and the smaller number from the upper pair was added to the larger number in the lower pair, which resulted in the two sums being the same (see fig. 1).",14,mtms2010-09-68a,,
"Sherry, a student at Lincoln Junior High School, looked at two cases and saw that the sums had the same values in the ones digit and tens digits of their addends. This explained why the sums were the same (see fig. 2). Morgan, another student at ",15,mtms2010-09-68a,,
"Forestdale School, compared the values being added with the middle square’s value in the sum. She placed a 17 in the upper-left-corner square of her 3 × 3 grid. She noticed that the upper-left-corner value was 11 fewer than the middle-square value while the lower-right-corner value was 11 more than the middle-square value. The upper-right corner was 9 fewer than the middle square value, and the lower-left-corner value was 9 more than the middle-square value. The differences canceled each other out, resulting in the two sums being the same. Her example (see fig. 3) explored this computation:  17 + 28 + 39 = (28 − 11) +  28 + (28 + 11) = 84  19 + 28 + 37 = (28 – 9) +  28 + (28 + 9) = 84",16,mtms2010-09-68a,,
Several students generalized the  process algebraically. Olivia and ,17,mtms2010-09-68a,,
Fig. 2 The ones digits and tens digits of the addends led to Sherry’s solution process.,18,mtms2010-09-68a,,
"Renee, students at Hilliard City Schools, used a through i to represent the corresponding values in the 3 × 3 grid (see fig. 4). They then represented the corner values in terms of the middle-square value. This representation showed, in general, what Morgan found in her specific case. The upper-left-corner value was 11 fewer than the middle-square value, whereas the lower-right-corner value was 11 more than the middle-square value. The upper-right-corner value was 9 fewer than the middle-square value, and the lower-left-corner value was 9 more than the middlesquare value. They then found that both of the sums equaled three times the middle-square value.",19,mtms2010-09-68a,,
Classmate Christopher let x represent the value of the upper-left corner of the 3 × 3 grid and then represented all other values of the grid in relation to x. He then found the sums of the two diagonals (see fig. 5). ,20,mtms2010-09-68a,,
"Alexis, another student at Hill- iard City Schools, let A represent the value of the upper-left corner of the 3 × 3 grid. She concluded that since the middle-square value was added in both sums, she only needed to focus on the sum of the corner values. She represented each corner value in relation to the upper-left-corner value and found the sum of the diagonal corners (see fig. 6). Both Christopher’s and Alexis’s processes led to the sums being equal. ",21,mtms2010-09-68a,,
"Fig. 3 Morgan discovered a relationship among the addends and the number in the center of the square, regardless of where the square was positioned. ",22,mtms2010-09-68a,,

"What we were trying to prove  was that the sums of the diagonals are equal. Since you add  e to each diagonal line, we had  to get each side in terms of e.  We started with: a + e + i = c + e + g",25,mtms2010-09-68a,,
We substituted each variable in terms of e using the patterns we had discovered. This can by stated by the following equation: (e − 11) + e + (e + 11) =  (e − 9) + e + (e + 9) where e equals the middle point of the x in the box. The equation can be simplified by: 3e − 11 + 11 = 3e − 9 + 9,26,mtms2010-09-68a,,
And even further by: 3e = 3e,27,mtms2010-09-68a,,
"So, not only will the sum of the diagonals be equal, they will also be equal to three times the middle number.",28,mtms2010-09-68a,,

Equations: x + (x + 11) + (x + 22) = 33 + 3x (Top left to bottom right) x + 10 x + 11 x + 12 (x + 2) + (x + 11) + (x + 20) = 33 + 3x (Top right to bottom left) x + 20 x + 21 x + 22 33 + 3x = 33 + 3x,31,mtms2010-09-68a,,
"As we see in this figure, each diagonal sum is equal to 33 + 3x. This demonstrates that the two diagonal sums of a 3 × 3 square will always be equal. (As a matter of fact, this is applicable to squares of all sizes.)",32,mtms2010-09-68a,,
Fig. 6 Alexis was able to generalize after examining the relationship among the four corner numbers.,33,mtms2010-09-68a,,
"The two sums of the two diagonals compare because they are and always will be the same. This is because the middle number is the same in both sums, and the numbers in the top left and bottom right and top right and bottom left will always be 22 numbers apart.",34,mtms2010-09-68a,,

"Fig. 7 Gabrielle was able to explain the pattern but also found that the special property held for vertical and horizontal sums through the center, as well. ",38,mtms2010-09-68a,,
"In fact, Christopher concluded that  the sums of the diagonals would be equivalent regardless of the size of the square. This thought opens the door to an excellent extension of the problem:   What if you had a 4 × 4 square or a 5 × 5 square? Will the sums be the same, and why? ",39,mtms2010-09-68a,,
"Another variation is to use a grid other than a 10 × 10, such as an 8 × 8, and place the numbers 1 through 64. Are the sums still the same for the  diagonals of a 3 × 3 grid or a 4 × 4 grid? ",40,mtms2010-09-68a,,
"Gabrielle, a student at St. Andrew’s Junior High School, made another discovery (see fig. 7). She found that the middle column and middle row of the 3 × 3 grid were the same sum and that the two sums were the same as those of the two diagonals of the 3 × 3 grid. Once again, students can examine what happens when using larger grids. Will the columns of a  4 × 4 grid sum to the same values as the rows of a 4 × 4 grid? How would these sums compare with sums of the diagonals of the grid? This task contains many opportunities for exploration. I hope you try some of them.",41,mtms2010-09-68a,,
