"Regardless of where the 3 × 3 box is placed on the grid, the sum of the diagonals will be equal.",6,mtms2010-02-317a,,
Let n represent the number in the upper-left corner of any 3 × 3 section of the grid. The relative values of the other squares are shown. ,7,mtms2010-02-317a,,
The sum of the diagonal from the top left to the bottom right will be the following: n + (n + 11) + (n + 22) = 3n + 33,8,mtms2010-02-317a,,
The sum of the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left will be this: n + 10 n + 20 n + 1 n + 11 n + 21 n + 2 n + 12 n + 22 (n + 2) + (n + 11) + (n + 20) = 3n + 33,9,mtms2010-02-317a,,
Notice that the sum along each diagonal is also three times the center square.,10,mtms2010-02-317a,,
