Stacking bales of hay in a barn provides the context for a team of teachers to develop a rich lesson involving geometric solids.,3,mtms2011-05-536a,,
rRoughly one-fifth of America’s public  school students attend rural schools. Low mathematics achievement scores in these communities suggest that math instruction needs to focus on the skills and content necessary for twenty-first-century jobs in contexts that are meaningful to these populations (NCTM 2006). ,4,mtms2011-05-536a,,
"One rural school worked to better address the learning needs of its students by developing, revising, and implementing a series of problembased activities in a context that connected to the students’ community. The lessons involved storing and selling hay. A team of mathematics educators—classroom teachers, a vice principal, a curriculum specialist, and  two university professors—produced this series, known collectively as Farmer Dan’s Barn Project.  the setting",5,mtms2011-05-536a,,
"A rural middle school in the southeastern Ohio Appalachian foothills serves 380 students in grades 6−8. In 2005−2006, 43.3 percent of its students were identified as economically disadvantaged, and 21.5 percent were identified as students with disabilities. As a result of low math scores on state tests, seventh-grade and eighth-grade mathematics classes were extended from 44 minutes to 88 minutes. The teacher team faced the question of how to use the extra time effectively, knowing that twice as much of the ",6,mtms2011-05-536a,,

"Based Learning (PBL), although the PBL framework was not used explicitly. The lesson addressed several of the Problem Solving Standards for grades 6−8, in that programs should enable students to— •  solve problems that arise in mathematics and in other contexts, •  monitor and reﬂ ect on the process of mathematical problem solving, and •  apply and adapt a variety of appropriate strategies to solve problems. (NCTM 2000, p. 256) ",8,mtms2011-05-536a,,
"Most mathematics lessons at the school followed a format of lecture, practice, and reteaching; then, increasingly complex problems would be assigned. When a student needed a formula, he or she asked the teacher, and it was provided. This expedient approach did not allow for the development of resourcefulness or metacognitive skills. ",9,mtms2011-05-536a,,
"For this lesson, the teacher team  wanted to reverse this format by situating a student within a content domain (the use of geometric solids) and providing an investigation. When direction was needed, it arose naturally in the course of the investigation. As a result, it became clear that many students were cracking the spines of their textbooks for the very fi rst time to fi nd formulas on their own. Such a change inevitably caused some student and teacher frustrations, but would the benefi ts outweigh the costs? ",10,mtms2011-05-536a,,

"One of the teachers, Dan, is also a hay farmer, and he was the source of accurate knowledge about the dimensions and pricing of hay bales. Such accuracy was key to communicating to students the relevance of the investigation rather than merely supplying contrived word problems, as typically found in instruction.

"same would not result in improved learning. It was an opportune time to craft an approach that connected with students’ lives in the rural area. The Farmer Dan activity described in this article couples two areas: professional development and changing pedagogy, curriculum, and “assessments for learning, rather than assessments of learning” (Partnership for 21st Century Skills 2007, p. 2).",14,mtms2011-05-536a,,
"The teacher team targeted areas and volumes of geometric solids as the content for lesson development and improvement. This content area was chosen before the release of the Curriculum Focal Points document (NCTM 2006) and the draft of the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (Corestandards.org 2010). This content aligned remarkably well with both documents’ assessment of the important ideas in grades 7 and 8. Moreover, the topic, which spanned both grades, was one on which students performed poorly on state math assessments.",15,mtms2011-05-536a,,
"Students needed additional help with solving word problems, locating appropriate resources (informal research), applying their skills in different domains, and writing about their work. Although the lesson was centered on mathematics content goals, it also addressed the need to increase student engagement and responsibility for learning, consistent with recognized indicators for college readiness (Conley 2007). ",16,mtms2011-05-536a,,
"The project drew on research on  problem-based approaches to learning mathematics. This research noted that students’ confi dence in mathematics improved, as did their view of mathematics, after working with this type of activity. Clarke, Breed, and Fraser (2004) describe this scenario of mathematics as “having arisen to meet the needs of society, rather than [being] a set of arbitrary rules” (p. 7). Such approaches are consistent with Problem- dimensions of a barn that had a rectangular footprint and a triangular-prism roof and devising a plan for stacking the hay that maximized the number of bales that could be stored. ",17,mtms2011-05-536a,,
"The four parts of the lesson were presented to students and modified three times throughout the course of the project. Farmer Dan’s Barn Project was designed to connect mathematics instruction to hay production, a relatively common local practice. The lesson focused on storing hay (parts 1 and 3) and selling hay (part 4) (see the sidebar on p. 540). Part 2 connected the idea of surface area to the net produced in part 1. In part 4, students compared the volumes and price per bale of square bales (this bale shape is actually a rectangular prism, but it is called square) with round bales (a cylinder). Many students provided incomplete considerations of the given information. For instance, in part 3, students were given figure 1 and this prompt:  Using the calculated number of bales, Farmer Dan’s children have two different plans to stack the same number of hay bales. Jake’s plan is to stack 8 bales high, but Barbara plans to stack only 4 bales high. How can both plans work?",18,mtms2011-05-536a,,
"Students were asked to fill out a  K-W-L chart (what I know, what I want to know, and what I learned). One student considered only the height of the barn (see fig. 2a). Although this solution suggested that the student mentally stacked the bales with both the long side vertically (four high) and one square side vertically (eight high), it does not demonstrate consideration of whether this arrangement would be feasible, given the other dimensions of the barn. ",19,mtms2011-05-536a,,
"The K-W-L chart provided evidence of an inattention to the details of height, as well. Similar versions of  the answer provided in figure 2a included students drawing the barn and showing four or eight bales stacked in a corner. No student took into account the pitched roof of the barn, which could have been used for storage. This detail was provided to assess students’ extended level of engagement and understanding. Barring a loft, the pitched roof would allow for even higher stacks than those used by Farmer Dan’s children.",20,mtms2011-05-536a,,
"This representative solution would seem to require either an adjustment to the task or to its implementation. The teacher team decided to leave the written prompt as is, even if underspecified. However, the teacher would encourage students to consider all the information provided, highlighting part 3 as a specific example. This led  to more robust solutions, such as that given in figure 2b.",21,mtms2011-05-536a,,
Giving students additional mathematics activities that promote writing and communication would likely improve their solutions and provide better evidence of their thinking. The tasks were structured using such cognitive supports as asking students to use given dimensions to draw sketches of the barn as a first step in solving the problem. (See the sidebar.),22,mtms2011-05-536a,,
"In an early version of the task, a student whose family did not farm suggested that square bales could be stacked on their small faces (vertically), which offered a unique mathematical solution not considered by farm students (who would likely never stack bales this way).

"The four parts of the lesson required a variety of representations, including drawing, sketching, and writing; working with formulas by hand and with a calculator; and discussing ideas with peers. Such a diversity of requirements offered more students opportunities to use their strengths toward the goal of completing the task. It also served as a great example of how differentiated instruction, deeply embedded in a task, can improve instruction for all students.",55,mtms2011-05-536a,,
"During the fi rst implementation  of the lesson, students worked in groups and were given only one part of the activity at a time, receiving the next part only after the teacher had checked their work for understanding. This allowed for more ﬂ exible pacing, with some groups completing two or more parts in a single 88-minute class period and others working on one part for the entire period. The pace of a group was often determined not by the mathematical abilities represented in the group but by the time the group devoted to different parts of the  task. Some groups produced elaborate sketches of the barn; others presented detailed tabular calculations. The teacher team developed two extension activities (which are appended online) and used them as homework.  iMpleMentations",56,mtms2011-05-536a,,
"In the first implementation of the lesson, a number of concerns surfaced and were discussed later by the teacher teams. These concerns included the need to better scaffold student entry into a different task structure and how to implement the resource-finding component. In addition, a number of the original instructions provided to students needed clarification. To address these weaknesses, the teacher  team needed a framework for revising and testing the curriculum. ",57,mtms2011-05-536a,,

"The Farmer Dan lesson developed through three cycles. Some major revisions included restructuring the order of activities (for increasing levels of difficulty) and providing students with all four activities at one time (instead of sequentially after the teacher had verified each part’s completion). In so doing, students could work at their own pace. The introduction was modified to include a discussion of students’ farming knowledge, available resources, and more explicit directions. A title page and example problem (completed as a class) were added to situate student thinking within the content domain of geometric solids. A plus-delta chart (see fig. 4) was included to help students identify what they felt they knew well, what could use improvement, and how it could be improved. ",71,mtms2011-05-536a,,

"The frustrations over the new  practice of having to locate resources and formulas needed for the task were felt by both students and teachers. As a result, the team discussed the appropriateness of reversing the lecturepractice-(re)teach sequence. Some team members felt that introducing the Farmer Dan lesson at the beginning of a unit would build motivation through the lecture, which would then lead up to the lesson as a culminating activity. The team concluded that a hybrid option of keeping the entire Farmer Dan lesson at the beginning of the unit but including more explicit instructions best allowed for student engagement with the material and the development of academic skills (such as locating necessary resources).  tasK reVisions sUpported BY data",90,mtms2011-05-536a,,

"Implementing both lesson study and Farmer Dan’s Barn Project exposed some key insights relevant to future attempts with similar work. This activity called on students to engage in a style of learning to which they were not accustomed. They required more direction and support to locate resources on their own, work effectively in groups, and persist in multistep problems. These skills should be introduced early in the year and gradually become a regular feature of instruction. ",109,mtms2011-05-536a,,
"The activity also promoted student  engagement with the material and fostered the development of important skills that predict future success in math, other subjects, and life.

"Implementing the lesson-study  model and rooting the lesson in community practices produced an effective framework for peer collaboration among the teachers. It engaged the teacher team as skilled professionals; it also called on their classroom experience and knowledge of content and pedagogy so that they could serve as creators of curriculum rather than just consumers. Moreover, teacher research into classroom practice had the advantage of local relevance and the payoff of making evidence-based, formative adjustments to practice. Classroom observation, K-W-L charts, consensograms, and plus-delta charts were effective tools to collect data, which helped structure curricular revision and peer collaboration.",112,mtms2011-05-536a,,
