The Zero Box,2,mtms2008-11-222a,,
The concept of adding and subtracting positive and negative numbers is not easy for middle school students to grasp. An effective bridge from the use of manipulatives and pictures to the use of traditional symbolic representation (number sentences) and mathematical rules is needed so that students can internalize the process. The zero box is just such a bridge. ,3,mtms2008-11-222a,,
"One way to successfully teach add ing signed integers is using differentcolored plastic chips that represent positive and negative numbers. The process can be modeled using black positive (+) and red negative (–) chips. At first, students add only black chips (5 black + 3 black = 8 black, which means +8) or add only red chips  (3 red + 6 red = 9 red, which means −9). This concept is easy for students to grasp, since the task requires simply combining two like colors of chips and counting them. The process can also be explored using pictures, which help students move away from chips and tackle numbers with larger absolute values. Students quickly learn that when adding two positive numbers or adding two negative numbers, they add the absolute values of the numbers and then give the sum the sign of both numbers. The jump from manipulatives to symbols is rapid for most students; it allows them  to add, for example, –65 + –37, without working through the laborious process of using chips. ",4,mtms2008-11-222a,,
"The next challenge is for students to add a positive number and a negative number. This process requires students to understand that the sum of opposite numbers is always zero (for example, –4 + 4 = 0). Although students can be told this fact, it is more useful if they discover it on their own using a number line. When adding positive and negative numbers using chips, the process of combining is different. When a group of black chips is combined with a group of red chips, the result is a pile of red and black chips. Students must now be reminded of the opposite rule. Students are shown that a red chip + a black chip = zero (–1 +  (+1) = 0); therefore, the pair can be removed. This process is repeated until only one color of chip remains. The remaining chips represent the sum. ",5,mtms2008-11-222a,,
"Once students become comfortable with this process using the tactile chips or pictures, it can be simplified. Students eventually realize that just by looking at the combined pile of chips, they can predict (1) how many pairs they need to remove and (2) what color the remaining chips will be at the end of the process. At this point, they can, for example, remove 5 reds and ",6,mtms2008-11-222a,,

Students realize that they have to remove the smaller amount of one color of chips. Students rapidly master this process, but there is a limitation. When increasingly larger numbers are used in calculations, it becomes a laborious process to use actual chips or pictures. The zero box attempts to bridge this gap. ",8,mtms2008-11-222a,,
"The zero box replaces the pictorial representation of chips with a bridge to the strictly symbolic. To use the zero box, students are given these directions: 1.  Look at the two numbers to be added. Determine which is the smaller of the two numbers, the positive or the negative. The analogy to the chip process is to ask, “Are there fewer red or black chips?” 2.  Since all chips of that color need to be removed, place the number with the smaller absolute value (the fewer chips) into the zero box. It is useful to draw an arrow from the expression to the box so that students can see where this number is coming from.  3.  Inside the zero box, the value of the expression must equal zero. Hence, ",9,mtms2008-11-222a,,
"Fig. 1 The inner workings of the zero box if a negative number is in the box, the other side of the box must be filled with its opposite to get a sum of zero. The opposite is pulled from the other number in the original expression (as in removing chips). Once this is done, the condition of the zero box is met.  4.  The number that remains after this  process is the sum; it is the difference between the second number in the box and the second number in the original expression.",10,mtms2008-11-222a,,
" It is a good idea to introduce this process by explicitly showing how it relates to using chips by modeling the problem using both techniques simultaneously. Some students balk at learning the new method. However, if a harder problem is given (–43 + 54), they realize that drawing so many chips would be slow and time-consuming. Within five minutes, using the zero box becomes the method that most students prefer. ",11,mtms2008-11-222a,,
"One powerful outcome of using the zero box is that students are able to discover on their own that adding a positive number to a negative number requires subtraction. This knowledge usually occurs after students practice  several zero box problems. For some students, it is important to be more explicit. Although they understand that they are “taking away” +6 from +13 and putting it in the zero box (in the sample problem), they may not readily see that they are subtracting. The teacher should show them that they need to subtract the amount in the zero box from the original amount to get the answer. ",12,mtms2008-11-222a,,
"Although it is important to codify this process eventually as a rule, it is usually unnecessary. Most students will have already internalized the process. However, it is important to clarify the situation for those students who need it. Stated explicitly, when adding a positive and negative, one takes the absolute value of both numbers, subtracts the smaller absolute value from the larger absolute value, and gives the sum the sign of the original number with the larger absolute value. Using the zero box as a reference point shows students why they need to subtract when adding a negative, rather than just telling them to remember the rule. Later, if students get confused, they can always go back to the zero box and check their work to remind themselves of why the calculation works. ● ",13,mtms2008-11-222a,,
