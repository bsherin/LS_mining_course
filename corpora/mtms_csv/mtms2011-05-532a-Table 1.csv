"THE GIANT PURSE 1. What is the average height of the typical adult female?  3. Suppose the bottom of her purse is 20 inches deep,  from front to back. How much leather would it take to make her purse? Pretend that each face, or side, of the purse is rectangular and ignore the overlapping leather needed to stitch the purse together.",2,mtms2011-05-532a,,
"2.  Measure Cathy’s height in the second to last frame  (in cm). Using your answer for question 1 and Cathy’s height, estimate the actual measurements of the following:    a.  The height of the front of the purse (ignore the  handle) 4. Suppose the purse were really 65 inches tall (excluding the handle) and that the ratios of all corresponding lengths were the same, as in the cartoon.",3,mtms2011-05-532a,,

"SOLUTIONS (Answers may vary based on student estimations.) 1.  The average height of U.S. females between 20 and 29 is  about 5 ft. 4 1/2 in. (or 64.5 in.).  2.  In the cartoon, we estimate that Cathy is about 1.5 cm  tall and the purse is about 1 cm tall. (You could also measure in inches to give your students more practice with operations using fractions.) a.  Since 1 cm is 2/3 of 1.5 cm, the purse would be  (2/3) × (64.5 in.) = 43 in. high.",6,mtms2011-05-532a,,

Students might  ﬁ nd this to be a rather large number. They could convert the dimensions to feet (e.g., 129 inches is 10 3/4 feet) and ﬁ nd the surface area of the purse (or divide 15,394 by 144—the number of square inches in a square foot). You might also ask students to compute the surface area both ways. Many students will divide 15,394 by 12, since there are 12 inches in a foot. This scenario could promote a valuable discussion on metric versus customary units of measure.",21,mtms2011-05-532a,,
"4.  a.  To ﬁ nd the width, construct and solve the following  proportion, where x represents the width:  of leather to make the purse. Again, students might convert to square feet and compute the surface area using this unit of measure, as well. ",22,mtms2011-05-532a,,
"OTHER IDEAS •  If students are familiar with the Pythagorean  theorem, they could start by assuming that the 65-inch measure is the diagonal of the purse (as television screens and computer screens are measured). Using this number, they could estimate the reasonable height and width for the pictured purse. •  This activity could also be the basis for developing  ideas of similarity, scale, and scale factor.",23,mtms2011-05-532a,,
"•  Although the purse is not really a rectangular prism (and the sides do not go all the way to the top), students could also use this activity to explore volume.",24,mtms2011-05-532a,,
