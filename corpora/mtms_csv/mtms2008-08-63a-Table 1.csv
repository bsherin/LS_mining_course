"BooKs do the Math: secrets, lies,  and algebra Wendy Lichtman, 2007. Ages 10 and up, 192 pp., $16.99 cloth. ISBN 9780-06-122955-8. Greenwillow Books; www.harpercollinschildrens.com. ",1,mtms2008-08-63a,,
"Do the Math: Secrets, Lies, and Algebra is fiction for young adults. The story is told from the perspective of Tess, an eighth grader. She loves mathematics and uses it to describe situations in her life. She relates her popularity to others using inequalities. For example, according to her calculations, “1 math whiz < 1 popular boy.” Each chapter is dedicated to a particular mathematics term. The chapters include titles such as “Inequalities,” “Graphs,” “Venn Diagrams,” “Percentages,” “The Quadratic Equation,” “Parallel Lines,” “A Complete Circle,” “The Number Line,” “Prime Numbers,” “Imaginary Numbers,” “Extraneous Solutions,” “Asymptotes, Non-Euclidean Geometry, and Other Things I Didn’t Learn Yet,” “Exponents,” and “Infinity.” Although these chapter titles sound as if they could be in a middle school textbook, the story of this eighth grader is so interesting that it almost tricks readers into learning mathematics as they read.

"This novel is written for a middle  school audience. I envision it being used in a reading or language arts class as easily as I see it being used  in a mathematics class. As a read aloud or class study, this book would allow middle schoolers to see how mathematics concepts can go beyond pencil-and-paper calculations. I think of this creative book as a young adult version of The Math Curse by Jon Scieszka. There are too few books out there that include such blatant mathematics content. I look forward to using this book in conjunction with my mathematics curriculum.",3,mtms2008-08-63a,,

"This book is geared toward teacher educators and preservice and in- service teachers. There are five distinct chapters (by different authors) on various topics: “Understanding Subtraction through Enhanced Communication,” “Communicating Ideas about Space and Shape,” “Constructing and Connecting 2-D and 3-D Shapes (with Lego and Block CAD),” “Exploring Movement through ICT (Robots),” and “Investigating Mathematical Reasoning and Decision Making.” Each chapter presents ",7,mtms2008-08-63a,,

The point is made that preservice and in-service teachers must reflect on the value of an activity before working through it with students. The accompanying DVD provides several insightful videos, photographs, and additional materials. ",9,mtms2008-08-63a,,
"Since the authors are from different countries, some of the writing is difficult to understand. One video excerpt is in German, which limits its usefulness for non-German speakers. The chapter on subtraction communication was very interesting as well as the chapter on shape-making through a constuctivist approach. This is not the first source I would go to for preservice education ideas, but there are some useful ideas.",10,mtms2008-08-63a,,

"Mathematics and Beauty: aesthetic approaches to teaching children Nathalie Sinclair, 2006. 208 pp., $34.95 paper. ISBN 0-8077-4722-X. Teachers College Press; (800) 5756566; www.teacherscollegepress.com. ",12,mtms2008-08-63a,,
"It can be difficult to motivate students at times, especially in the field of mathematics. Sinclair believes that students can be motivated if teachers take a more aesthetic approach to mathematics. Using the  work of several scholars, she makes claims about humans’ need for aesthetics. Many examples from middle school students in North American cities help support these views. She explains three roles that aesthetics play in mathematics: motivational, generative, and evaluative. The students used in Sinclair’s research model examples of each role. She uses a variety of references to back up her ideas. The student examples help the reader see how aesthetics can be introduced into the regular classroom. All the examples involve technology, such as The Geometer’s Sketchpad and the Colour Calculator. In some classrooms, technology is not so readily available, so for those teachers it would be harder to find examples that they could relate to their own students. ",13,mtms2008-08-63a,,
"This book includes a lot of information on how to approach mathematics from an aesthetic viewpoint. It is a good read, but be aware that the examples given are geared toward a technologically immersed classroom.  Michelle Schwartze,  Lincoln Middle School, Peoria, IL 61603",14,mtms2008-08-63a,,

"This book is meant to ease the mind of the adult who suffered through a traumatic mathematics career. It discusses the four operations as well as fractions, decimals, percents, algebra, and probability. The author places related problems in each chapter for readers to solve. These problems are not complex, since it is assumed that the author added these to ease the reader’s mind. Three appendixes discuss division of fractions, sudoku, and answers to the  problems within the text. ",16,mtms2008-08-63a,,
"Although I really enjoyed this  book, the preferred audience should be middle school students. However, some of the content would be deemed inappropriate by parents and administrators. For example, problems 16, 60, 66, 73, 79, and 80 contain subjects involving alcohol, weapons, or relationships. Although interesting to adults, they would be inappropriate for students. I believe if these areas were changed, the book would be helpful to middle school students. ",17,mtms2008-08-63a,,
"That said, I will use parts of the book with middle school students. I think the explanation describing division of fractions is excellent. The ongoing story of Charlie would really capture the attention of the average student. ",18,mtms2008-08-63a,,
"If the book were geared toward  middle school, it would be more marketable. This would be a book that I would recommend to an adult who had a poor mathematical history.",19,mtms2008-08-63a,,

"Math logic Mysteries:  Mathematical Problem solving  with deductive reasoning Marilynn L. Rapp Buxton, 2007. Grades 5-8, 80 pp., $12.95 paper. ISBN 1-593632193. Prufrock Press; (800) 998-2208; www.prufrock.com. ",22,mtms2008-08-63a,,
Math Logic Mysteries presents the opportunity for students in grades 5–8 to develop critical-thinking and logical-thinking skills while also giving them the skills practice that is often required for standardized testing. The author has developed a series of forty-eight matrix puzzles that are conveniently grouped from easy to challenging and cover a wide range of middle school mathematics topics.,23,mtms2008-08-63a,,
"Each puzzle describes a situation, then gives a set of clues. The puzzles  allow students to practice essential mathematics skills and then apply deductive reasoning skills to solve them. Number operations, fractions, square roots, probability, and algebra are used to help solve the puzzles. Some of the items require the students to practice the skills first and then solve the puzzle; other puzzles have the mathematics embedded. ",24,mtms2008-08-63a,,
"The matrix puzzles are set up for the students, and a detailed sample problem demonstrates how to solve them. Unfortunately, a few, including the sample, cannot truly be solved with the matrices as shown in the book. The sample problem involves matching students to the number of school supplies that were purchased. To solve this problem with the given matrix, you have to assume that each student bought 1, 2, 3, or 4 items and then 5, 6, 7, or 8 items. This is not part of the problem and would need to be explained to students. Although this error only occurs in a few problems and can be worked around by providing additional instructions to students, it is a critical flaw in the design of the matrix puzzles and should be fixed if the book is revised.",25,mtms2008-08-63a,,
"Even with the error described  above, I would recommend this book to middle school teachers who are looking for ways to engage their students in critical-thinking skills or to use as an enrichment activity in their classroom. I would advise teachers to work out the solutions to these puzzles before using them with students, but a detailed solution key is included at the end of the book for students or teachers to refer to if they had questions.  Patricia Gaffney Kridler, Auburn Middle School, Warrenton, VA 20187; doctoral student, George Mason University, Fairfax, VA 22030 ●",26,mtms2008-08-63a,,
