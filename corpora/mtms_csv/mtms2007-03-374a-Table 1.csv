Tim ate 100 cookies in 5 days. Each day he ate 6 more than the day before. how many cookies did he eat on the fi rst day?,5,mtms2007-03-374a,,
"Students used three basic strategies to fi nd the number of cookies that Tim ate on the fi rst day— guess and check, algebra, and start with the mean. ashlee, a student in Nicole houghton’s mathematics class in mary Lou mahone middle School in Kenosha, Wisconsin, used a guess-and-check method to determine  the  number  of  cookies  that  Tim  ate  on the fi rst day (see fi g. 1). many students used a highlow process while guessing and checking to narrow the number of cookies. ashlee, on the other hand, used consecutive integers to guess the number of cookies. This allowed her to notice that each time she  decreased  the  number  of  cookies  she  started ",6,mtms2007-03-374a,,

"I knew that Tim ate a total of 100 cookies. I also knew that Tim ate cookies for five days, and that each day he ate six more cookies than he did the previous day.",14,mtms2007-03-374a,,
"To  make  the  problem  easier  to  understand,  I  decided to write a number sentence where x was the amount of cookies that Tim ate on the first day. When y was equal to the number of the amount of days after the first, the expression x + 6y would represent the amount of cookies Tim ate for every day after the first.",15,mtms2007-03-374a,,
"On  the  first  day,  Tim  would  just  have  eaten  the  amount x.",16,mtms2007-03-374a,,
"On the second day, he ate x + 6(1), or x + 6.",17,mtms2007-03-374a,,

"The final equation was x + x + 6 + x + 12 + x + 18 + x + 24 = 100. I simplified the equation by combining like values, and found that 5x + 60 = 100. Next, I solved for x. ",21,mtms2007-03-374a,,
"I subtracted 60 from 100 to find a new equation,  5x = 40. ",22,mtms2007-03-374a,,

"Julie let x represent the number of cookies eaten each day. She then represented the number of cookies eaten the other days by adding 6 to each successive day. allison used a more generalized expression. She represented the number of cookies eaten on a given day using the expression x + 6y, where x represented the number of cookies eaten on the first day and y represented the number of days after the first day (see fig. 3). From there, she represented the number of cookies eaten each day and set the sum of the expressions equal to 100 to solve for the number of cookies on the first day. allison is a student of Pat Gambino and mary henry of William annin middle School in Basking ridge, New Jersey.",26,mtms2007-03-374a,,
"The mean was the third common method used to solve the task. Brittany, another one of houghton’s students, divided the total number of cookies by the number of days, which is the mean number of cookies eaten per day. Brittany assumed that 20 cookies were eaten on the third day. Then she subtracted 6 from 20 to get the number of cookies eaten the day before 20 cookies were eaten. She then subtracted 6  from the solution to get the number of cookies eaten on the first day. Brittany applied a similar process by adding 6 successively to get the number of cookies eaten the two days after eating 20 cookies. She checked that the sum was correct before concluding that Tim ate 8 cookies on the first day (see fig. 4). Oliver  and  Samantha,  two  students  in  Beverly  Jacobs’s  mathematics  class  at  Orchard  middle School  in  Solon,  Ohio,  also  used  the  mean  as  a strategy. Oliver found the mean first, implying that Tim ate 20 cookies each day. he then adjusted the number to meet the conditions. First, he took away 6 cookies from the first day and added them to the last day. Then he took 6 cookies away from the second day and added them to the number of cookies on the fourth day. Oliver checked the conditions and realized  that  he  needed  to  take  another  6  cookies from the first day and move them to the fifth day, which gave him the appropriate number of cookies eaten on each day (see fig. 5). ",27,mtms2007-03-374a,,
Samantha also started with the mean and assumed that 20 cookies were eaten on each day. She then used the fact that Tim ate 6 more cookies each day to realize that the number of cookies eaten on the last day is 24 more than the number of cookies on the first day. ,28,mtms2007-03-374a,,
"VOL. 12, NO. 7  .  march 2007   375",29,mtms2007-03-374a,,
"She looked for two numbers that differed by 24 and added to 40, the total number of cookies for the two days. Once she found the two values for the first and last days, she was able to find the number of cookies eaten the remaining days (see fig. 6).",30,mtms2007-03-374a,,
"Teachers often indicated that although students used the mean to help find the solution, they were not sure that the students knew why it was helpful. I believe that two statistical ideas are at play here. First, the idea of mean is used as a balancing point. If you look at the number of cookies eaten each day  and how much the number differs from the mean, you can see the balancing property of the mean. The number of the cookies eaten on the first day differs by  20  –  8,  or  12,  cookies.  The  number  of  cookies eaten on the second day differs from the mean by 6 cookies. The fourth and fifth days also differ from the mean by 6 and 12 cookies, respectively. This shows that the first and second days’ sum differs from 40 (2 × 20) by a total of 18 cookies, as do the fourth and fifth days. The total difference of data values from the mean for values below the mean is always the same as the total difference of data values above the mean. hence, the mean “balances” the data. ",31,mtms2007-03-374a,,
"Suppose the task was altered to read as shown in figure 7. Then, there would be several solutions to this task, three of which are shown. In each case, the mean number of cookies eaten each day is 20. however,  the  amount  that  each  differs  from  the  mean varies. If we record the amounts that the data values differ below the mean as negative values and those above the mean as positive values, then we can see that  the  absolute  value  of  the  negative  sum  is  the same as that of the positive sum. also, note that the third example shows that the mean does not have to be one of the data values.",32,mtms2007-03-374a,,
"The second property used is based on the symmetry  of  the  data.  When  the  data  distribution  is symmetrical, the median and the mean are the same value. Since the number of cookies eaten each day increased by 6 cookies, the distribution is symmetrical. Plotting the data on a dot plot or number line can help students see this. In addition, since he only ate cookies on 5 days, the middle day will have the median  value  of  cookies,  which  is  also  the  mean. Suppose the following task was proposed:",33,mtms2007-03-374a,,

"The solution will be 5, 11, 17, 23, 29, and 35. The data distribution is symmetrical, and the mean and median are the same, 20 cookies. however, notice that 20 is not one of the amounts given. Notice, also, that the examples given for the task in figure 7 have five data values but that the distributions are not symmetrical, so the mean and median are different. Thus, the use of 20 cookies in the original task is based on the mean being a balancing point and the symmetry of the data distribution.",43,mtms2007-03-374a,,
"I used the activity sheet at the end of this article with students to examine the balancing property of the  mean.  after  making  the  box  plot  and  identifying the mean, the remaining questions ask students to examine what values must be added to keep the mean the same and balance the data. The mean number of pennies per person is 7. In question 4, Debbie has 11 pennies, which is 4 pennies above the mean. Therefore,  cortez  must  have  3  pennies,  4  pennies below the mean. Students may also notice that the mean number of pennies added to the data must also be 7. I hope you find this activity to be valuable to your students’ understanding of data and the mean.",44,mtms2007-03-374a,,
