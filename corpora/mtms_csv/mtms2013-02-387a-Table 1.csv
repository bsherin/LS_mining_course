"This book is about essential understanding of high school geometry. Four big ideas with examples are addressed in chapter 1 and then connected to instructions in chapter 3. For instance, “Geometry is about working with variance and invariance despite appearing to be about theorems” (p. 22). This point is illustrated with examples and linked to theorems, conjectures, and dynamic geometry software (DGS). Chapter 2 makes a connection with other strands as well as content in middle ",6,mtms2013-02-387a,,

school geometry and postsecondary mathematics. ,8,mtms2013-02-387a,,
"This book provides one perspective of essential ideas when teaching geometry in high school, not about what topics to cover. The links between high school geometry will help teachers see the big picture to situate their teaching. By looking at geometry as mathematics about variance and invariance, in which the theorem is the invariance that remains when others vary, the authors emphasize the importance of conjecturing when learning geometry linking to the dynamic features inherent in any diagram. However, areas that are lacking include why proofing, functions of proofs in the DGS, how to produce proof ideas, definitions of relations (not only objects as specified in the book), and criteria for definitions. Coordinate geometry in high school mathematics is not included, which should be specified clearly in the introduction. ",9,mtms2013-02-387a,,
"Some other areas of linking, such as non-Euclidean and three-dimensional Euclidean geometry, as well as the concept of slope, should also be pointed out. Some unnecessary terms can be deleted, such as on page 23: “provided that the figure remains triangular and in the plane” (three points are always in one plane in Euclidean geometry).",10,mtms2013-02-387a,,

"Ilana Horn, 2012. Gr. 6-12,  higher education, 100 pp., $29.95 paper. ISBN 978-0-87353-663-9; stock no. 13791. National Council  of Teachers of Mathematics;  www.nctm.org.",13,mtms2013-02-387a,,
"This is not a book for casual reading; its goal is to fundamentally change the way that teachers structure and implement collaborative work in their classrooms. Horn melds her own extensive experience with robust research to paint a picture of equitable teaching in a healthy learning environment using complex instruction. She sensitizes the reader to the impact of status on learning and how traditional heterogeneous grouping perpetuates inequity among students. She redefines what it means to be “smart” in mathematics as posing interesting questions, making connections, representing ideas clearly, developing logical explanations, working systematically, and extending ideas. ",14,mtms2013-02-387a,,
"Classroom norms, agreed-on ways of behaving, are used to support equal-status interactions among students. Examples of norms include listening to others’ ideas, disagreeing with ideas instead of people, accepting that confusion is part of learning, and helping without giving answers. Horn outlines critical features and gives examples of group-worthy tasks, some of which are supported by classroom vignettes to help the reader mentally apply theory to practice. The book challenges the idea that mathematics is strictly hierarchical and that instruction should begin with easy concepts before tackling more challenging ones. ",15,mtms2013-02-387a,,
"Although the primary audience for the book is classroom teachers, it will also provide solid information for professional development teams, coaches, and teacher educators. Because of the book’s strong research foundation, the text is dense and would benefit from  more examples of tasks and classroom vignettes. I recommend this book for those who are seriously committed to examining their own practice because it relates to collaborative learning.  —Patricia D. Hunsader",16,mtms2013-02-387a,,

"This book comprises several different strategies designed to scaffold achievement for all students. The authors provide six different  examples (exit cards, choice boards, cubing, graphic organizers, learning contracts, and tiered lessons) that are designed to help students gain deeper understandings of mathematical concepts. The authors begin by providing insight into their philosophy on differentiation and explain the CIRCLE MAP—a visual model developed by the authors showing the requirements of successful differentiation. The authors explain each strategy included in this book as it relates back to the CIRCLE MAP.",21,mtms2013-02-387a,,
"Each strategy is provided with an  overview, information on how and when to use the strategy, directions and blank templates, real examples previously used in classrooms (from different grade levels), and teacher feedback on the strategy. I found this book to be a very useful resource for all classrooms, although the authors  specify the strategies as being used in grades 6-12. ",22,mtms2013-02-387a,,
"It is my opinion that using these strategies will provide an avenue of multimodal instruction that will likely meet the needs of all learners. I plan to implement these strategies in my own mathematics classes, grades 5-8, as they are flexible enough to be used in every grade level and in connection with each concept. Although the book is written for mathematics teachers, I believe that these strategies could be used in other subject areas as well.  —Shelli Casler-Failing",23,mtms2013-02-387a,,

"The Handy Math Answer Book provides answers to such questions as “Where did zero come from?” and “How is math used in biology?” Anyone interested in mathematics or preparing for instruction can use the book to finally answer the age-old question, “Why do I need to know this?”",27,mtms2013-02-387a,,
"The authors provide a user-friendly history of mathematics, presenting information about cultures, individuals, and concepts, so that teachers can easily find and use historical background for lessons. Elementary school and middle school teachers could use the history of measurement, time, and calendars to create interdisciplinary assignments. ",28,mtms2013-02-387a,,
"The applied mathematics and the  math in the science and computing  chapters can be used to motivate students by exposing them to various occupations that use math in (possibly) unexpected ways. The answers about mathematical modeling, probability, and statistics support the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics. Finally, the everyday and recreational math chapters are good tools for teachers who are interested in using real-life examples. These chapters contain topics that will motivate a variety of ages. ",29,mtms2013-02-387a,,
"Since the book is formatted with short answers, some topics are oversimplified, thus detracting from the mathematics, making it less rigorous, and reinforcing common misconceptions. As a teacher, I would also be wary about mathematical errors and typos in the text (i.e., -22 = 4; p. 99). Considering both the strengths and weaknesses of this text, I would say that it would be a good resource for classroom teachers or parents. It is always nice to be able to answer questions about where the mathematics came from, who has contributed to our mathematical knowledge, why mathematics is useful, and why it is important for everyone to know this—even if this information is not going to be on the test.",30,mtms2013-02-387a,,

Each chapter covers a different mathematical idea from the viewpoint of numbers or shapes, explaining concepts through the experiences of the characters. In one chapter, the number line is presented by numbers lining up in order. Fractions and decimals begin to move in between the whole numbers, much to their dismay, thus illustrating that the number line contains more than just whole numbers. This book covers math concepts that are appropriate for both middle school and high school students. The topics covered include negative numbers, properties of triangles, order of operation, trigonometry, countability, number theory, and sizes of inﬁ nity.",38,mtms2013-02-387a,,
"This book is a fun and creative  way to begin a discussion about new mathematical concepts and to pique the interests of students. A possible extension of this book is to have students write their own stories about mathematical concepts. By letting the numbers and other math ideas come alive as Pappas does, students can show the depth of their understanding, using unique models to demonstrate mathematical structures.

The book presents experiences of the staff at the Pueblo Gardens Elementary School during a journey to improve math performance and change the school culture. Instructional Coach Chris Confer, Principal Marco Ramirez, and teachers share the process used to transform an “underperforming” school into a “highly performing” school by taking “small steps” resulting in “big changes.” In telling the story, the authors present educators with a guidebook of instructional practices and strategies that foster an “I can” and “I will” culture. This change in mindset is the ﬁ rst step to improving math performance.",46,mtms2013-02-387a,,
"The eight chapters of the book focus on essential ideas that drive practical strategies for implementing change. Included in each chapter is a description of attempts to apply each of these essential ideas in the classroom.
