However, Dunston was forced to rethink vocabulary instruction for mathematics when her preservice teachers had difficulty connecting information from her literacy education methods course to mathematics classrooms. In addition, first-hand experience taught her that constructing a sentence with sufficient contextual information was difficult to accomplish and led students to activate incorrect or unrelated prior knowledge. For example, when presented with the sentence,  A slice of pizza or apple pie is an example of an acute angle, several students concluded that acute angles have at least one rounded or curved edge. A few others believed that acute is associated with the word cute; they thought the term meant that  the angle is found in or on something pretty or attractive.",6,Whats the Big Deal about Vocabulary?

9,Whats the Big Deal about Vocabulary?,"As a literacy educator, Dunston  maintains that vocabulary knowledge is acquired through a combination of incidental learning (encounters with unfamiliar words through reading and listening) and direct instruction (the teaching of specific word meanings) (Beck, McKeown, and Kucan 2002; Nagy 1988). Within the confines of direct instruction, a new vocabulary  engagement in mathematics where possible and that students should be allowed and encouraged to find ways to describe the phenomenon they are interacting with in their own words. The teacher’s role then is to help students connect the formal mathematical vocabulary term with their current understanding of the idea or concept. When discussing a rectangular prism’s appearance, for example, students often use words such as corner and sides to describe what they see. Further, students often use the word side to refer to both a face of the object (the six rectangular figures that comprise the shape) as well as the edge of the figure (the line segment formed by the intersection of two faces). Teachers should not discourage the use of these terms, but rather— 1.  point out the confusion in using  the same term to mean two different things; 2.  introduce the mathematical vocabulary terms of faces, edges, and vertices (where two or more edges meet); and 3.  encourage students to “speak  mathematically” to ensure clear communication of intent.

Thompson and Rubenstein (2000) write that although math vocabulary shares word meanings with English, it is controlled by and uniquely embedded in the field of mathematics.

Developing mathematics vocabulary knowledge allows adolescents to expand their abstract reasoning ability and move beyond operations to problem solving. Math vocabulary is also inextricably bound to students’ conceptual understanding of mathematics (Capraro, Capraro, and Rupley 2010; Capraro and Joffrion 2006; Kotsopoulos 2007).

For example, a guitar has strings, not keys. A guitar is strummed, not blown. The Frayer model (Frayer, Frederick, and Klausmeier 1969) is a graphic organizer that allows students to use inquiry to learn new concepts in mathematics and science. Students identify examples and nonexamples of a concept and differentiate between characteristics that define (or are associated with) the concept and characteristics that are interesting but not important. The following example will illustrate how the Frayer model can support the development of the terms prime numbers and composite numbers. One approach to helping students  conceptualize the idea of prime and composite numbers is through rectangular arrays. Students are asked to draw as many different rectangular arrays as they can whose area is equal to each set of numbers (e.g., the numbers 1–20). The numbers are then arranged according to the number of possible arrays (see table 1).

Using the Frayer model and the  array table in table 1, we draw students’ attention to numbers in the “2” column that have only two positive divisors. After introducing the term prime numbers to describe this group of numbers, we distribute copies of the Frayer model graphic organizer,  ask students to write the term in the oval (see fig. 1), and consider a series of examples and nonexamples.
