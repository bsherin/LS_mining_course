3,Co-Constructing Written Explanations,"Teachers across the nation are taking up the call to prepare students for new standards and assessments that require written explanations on a variety of math tasks. But what does it really mean to “explain your answer,” and how do we begin supporting students to write in a genre that is new to both students and teachers? ",3,Co-Constructing Written Explanations
4,Co-Constructing Written Explanations,"This article describes insights  from a yearlong project conducted by a researcher and three teachers from different school districts. The project team met once a month for three-hour workshops in which we discussed mathematical explanations and wrote some of our own. We designed five lessons to support  students in writing rich mathematical explanations, and the teachers piloted these lessons in their classrooms. In a process similar to lesson study, we videotaped the lessons, reflected on what worked and what did not work, and analyzed students’ writing to give us information about what next steps to take.

6,Co-Constructing Written Explanations,WHY WRITE MATHEMATICAL EXPLANATIONS?,6,Co-Constructing Written Explanations
7,Co-Constructing Written Explanations,"Although we were initially motivated to delve into this topic to prepare students for extended-response assessment items on standardized tests, we became even more motivated when we encountered research about the value of producing written explanations. First, cognitive scientists found that when students explain ideas to themselves, they learn more than when they work silently; and when they explain to someone else, they learn even more (Rittle-Johnson, Saylor, and Swygert 2008). Further, students who produce conceptual explanations perform better on measures of conceptual understanding than students who produce purely procedural explanations  (Matthews and Rittle-Johnson 2009). When students are asked to explain, they spend more time on each problem and have opportunties to revise their thinking or find holes in their reasoning that would otherwise go unnoticed (Chi 2000). Producing explanations may help  students develop the kinds of thinking and communication required to write proofs in future mathematics classes (Thurston 1998; Bicknell 1999). Finally, Pugalee (2004) found that students who produced written explanations solved more problems correctly than students who explained orally. Collectively, this research demonstrates how emphasizing written explanations has many benefits in addition to preparing students to perform well on the new standardized tests.",7,Co-Constructing Written Explanations
8,Co-Constructing Written Explanations,DESIGN PRINCIPLES,8,Co-Constructing Written Explanations
9,Co-Constructing Written Explanations,"To design our lessons, we drew from research on writing and genre instruction, as well as the principles for mathematical writing outlined by Casa (2015): (a) Establish the expectation to write early; (b) connect verbal and written explanations; and (c) attend to writing that promotes reasoning and argumentation. Framing mathematical explanations as a particular genre of writing helped us think about the series of decisions and choices that must be made by students as they write (Halliday 1985). Some research suggests that, rather than expecting students to develop desired forms of explanation  through exposure alone, teachers may need to explicitly draw students’ attention to the ways that language is used to communicate particular types of meaning (Schleppegrell 2007). However, other research suggests  that focusing too much on the way students communicate their mathematical ideas takes attention  away from the ideas themselves  (Moschkovich 2007). We knew that we wanted to support students with the language they would need to explain, but we were also wary of overscaffolding that would limit opportunities to engage with cognitively demanding mathematics. This idea resonated throughout our discussions as we considered the tension between scaffolding too much or too little and between narrowing or broadening what would be accepted as valid explanations in our classrooms.

10,Co-Constructing Written Explanations,CO-CONSTRUCTION OF MATHEMATICAL EXPLANATIONS,10,Co-Constructing Written Explanations
11,Co-Constructing Written Explanations,"Research suggests that collaborative writing can result in increased learning, especially for language learners (e.g., de la Colina and García Mayo 2007; Storch 2011). When students work together to produce a single product, they have to negotiate meaning, ask questions, and clarify their ideas. Although at times frustrating for students, collaborative writing supports the ability to communicate in different ways and for different purposes. Explaining your idea to someone else before you write it helps you try out your wording to see whether it makes sense to someone else. As one of our students explained, “I didn’t know how to say my idea, but my partner knew what I meant and helped me figure out how to write it.” Comments like this led us to experiment with different structures for co-constructing mathematical explanations. In one lesson, we tried the “teacher-student ",11,Co-Constructing Written Explanations

In these, a student produces part of an explanation while the teacher modifies or extends it. In other lessons, we attempted the “partner co-construc- tion” during which we varied the timing of the written explanations with think-pair-share-write or thinkwrite-pair-share activities. We also tried having students write explanations individually and then pair up  to write a new joint explanation that borrowed ideas from each. The lesson we share here includes elements of “group co-construction” and “wholeclass co-construction.” ",21,Co-Constructing Written Explanations
22,Co-Constructing Written Explanations,THE LESSON,22,Co-Constructing Written Explanations
23,Co-Constructing Written Explanations,"Our goals for this lesson were  (a) to see what features students were already including in mathematical explanations so we could build on these in future lessons; and (b) to get students to consider different ways to articulate their mathematical thinking. Teachers played a limited role in this lesson; they mainly helped move the posters from group to group and orchestrated the class discussion at the end. Students took the lead in solving, collaborating, and deciding what to include in their written explanations. Figure 1 describes the lesson. ",23,Co-Constructing Written Explanations
24,Co-Constructing Written Explanations,GROUP DISCUSSIONS: ILLUMINATING THE PROCESS,24,Co-Constructing Written Explanations
25,Co-Constructing Written Explanations,"We argue that this lesson gave students a reason to think carefully about the way they were communicating their ideas because their explanations had to be clear enough for the next group to understand. When students received a poster from another group, they were expected  to read how the group solved the problem and decide how to add to this explanation. After receiving a partial explanation from the previous group, one student led her group in understanding and responding: “What does it say?  Read it loud. OK. OK. Wait . . . what? I’m confused. . . . Oh, they meant that they divided the 3,180 by the 15. That’s Best Buy, right? What should we put next? The Apple store numbers?”",25,Co-Constructing Written Explanations
26,Co-Constructing Written Explanations,"Students were encouraged to  elaborate on the strategies of previous groups, although they often ended up adding different strategies or representing the problem a different way. To understand how students decided what to include, we audiorecorded one group of students in each class and analyzed the decisions they made together. Here we highlight the interactions of a focal group of four students in Gabriela López’s fifth-grade class as they responded to other groups’ partial explanations. (All students’ names are pseudonyms.) ",26,Co-Constructing Written Explanations
27,Co-Constructing Written Explanations,DISCOURSE ORGANIZATION,27,Co-Constructing Written Explanations
28,Co-Constructing Written Explanations,"Across project classrooms, students negotiated how they should organize  the information in their explanations. The focal group decided that the question “Which is a better deal?” needed a direct answer statement, “Best Buy is a better deal,” but they disagreed about whether this statement belonged at the beginning as an introduction or at the end as a conclusion. They also discussed which temporal sequencing words to add and where to use them. For example, Daniel attempted to break down the process into written steps: “First we divided. Second we . . . what did we do second? We need a second thing.” Rosa questioned this, “Why do we need a second one? That’s all we did.” Finally, Josh suggested, “Compared. Second we compared the prices.” Thus, students enacted some agency in deciding how the genre should be organized, and sometimes they struggled with whether to articulate what they did as a linear process when their problem-solving process was more often iterative and recursive (Schoenfeld 1992). Students tended to grapple with whether to justify their answer or present a faithful account of their problemsolving process.",28,Co-Constructing Written Explanations

33,Co-Constructing Written Explanations,"For example, Daniel suggested starting the explanation with “Dear  Mr. Marquez,” though the group opted instead to start with “I analyze that . . . ,” using the academic language that López encouraged them to use across the content areas. However, they later decided to address the principal directly by writing, “You should get the iPads® at Best Buy.” ",33,Co-Constructing Written Explanations
34,Co-Constructing Written Explanations,"Emily and Rosa focused on the audience, discussing the characteristics of the principal (“He’s a very honoring man”) and predicting his reaction when he read the explanation (“He’s gonna think we’re weird!”). Josh suggested including a legend with pictures of iPads to help clarify how much each iPad cost. Others suggested using labels that tell the store name over the calculations for prices at each store “because how’s he gonna know which store it is?” This suggests that posing problems with an authentic audience may spark student discussion of what the audience needs to know and how  to most clearly communicate mathematical ideas to those particular individuals.",34,Co-Constructing Written Explanations
35,Co-Constructing Written Explanations,EXTRA INFORMATION,35,Co-Constructing Written Explanations
36,Co-Constructing Written Explanations,"Students debated what information should be included. Josh suggested including information about taxes, but his group members decided against it “because it’s, like, not that important.” However, they decided to include information about the difference in price between the two stores at Rosa’s suggestion: “We need to subtract how much more is the Best Buy iPad than the Apple store. He needs to know how much more it costs.” Josh then suggested adding a sentence about how the small difference in price adds up when you buy a lot. This insight demonstrates some conceptual understanding as students interpreted the significance of their mathematical conclusions. At times, focusing on the audience may encourage students to consider including information that was not  explicitly asked for but would be important in real-world situations.",36,Co-Constructing Written Explanations
37,Co-Constructing Written Explanations,"NEGOTIATING WHAT  COUNTS AS “PROOF” As part of the writing task, we asked students to show evidence that would convince the principal they were correct so he would not waste money on the iPads. In response, students’ discussions included negotiating what counts as evidence and how to convince an audience. The notion of “checking work” was the most frequently discussed form of evidence among students in all classrooms. Using visuals, providing reasons, and solving in more than one way were mentioned much less frequently. In some cases, students used “checking work” purely as a display, without actually solving the inverse problem. When Rosa questioned whether the group knew they had the correct answer, Josh responded, “I know I’m right because I checked my work.” His group members accepted this  as reasonable without verifying how he “checked.” Students may benefit from further discussion about what counts as mathematical “proof ” in particular contexts and from seeing many examples of different kinds of reasoning beyond the use of inverse operations (Stylianides 2007).",37,Co-Constructing Written Explanations
38,Co-Constructing Written Explanations,CLASS DISCUSSIONS: REFLECTING ON THE PRODUCTS,38,Co-Constructing Written Explanations
39,Co-Constructing Written Explanations,"After students voted for the poster they found most convincing, a wholeclass discussion offered us a glimpse into which features students thought were most important. Figure 2(a) and (b) show the winning posters from two fifth-grade classrooms: one from the group interactions discussed  above (López’s class) and one from  Michelle Skubal’s class. Skubal decided to pose the problem with smaller numbers, which she felt would allow her students to focus more of their attention on articulating their explanations while still meeting grade-level standards. At first it may seem that Skubal had low expectations for her students, many of whom were below grade level in mathematics. However, she thought carefully and based her decision on several pieces of evidence suggesting that her students would benefit from this change, such as the length of time it takes students to complete multidigit subtraction problems or compute multiplication problems while looking up facts on a times table. She wanted all students to feel confident about joining in the discussion with their groups, and she prioritized explanations by making the problem a bit on the easier side.",39,Co-Constructing Written Explanations
40,Co-Constructing Written Explanations,"In both classrooms, students cited  having both words and visual representations as the most important factor in what made an explanation convincing. For example, one of  Skubal’s students explained her ideas about how words and visuals work  together to make meaning: “I liked the drawings. The model showed how much the iPads cost. And the explanation told you all about it and said how much money you save.” This suggests that students are attending to the multisemiotic nature of mathematical communication, experimenting with the interplay among three semiotic systems: language, mathematical symbols, and visual representations (O’Halloran 2008).",40,Co-Constructing Written Explanations
41,Co-Constructing Written Explanations,"In López’s classroom, a key part  of the discussion revolved around the extra information included at the bottom of the poster, telling how much it would cost to buy iPads for the whole school. The class thought this was useful information although it was not explicitly asked for in the problem. As long as students made sure to answer the question in the word problem, the class decided it was okay to add extra information. Although students appreciated the extra information, they had a lot of questions for the group who wrote this part, and they gave them an opportunity to clarify what they had done. The group explained that they multiplied the cost of  15 iPads by 2 and then multiplied the result by the number of classes in the school. Students asked why they multiplied by 2, and the group explained that this was to find the cost for 30 iPads, which they used as an estimate for the number of students in a class. Students agreed that this part of the poster would have been better if this information had been represented somehow. Through this activity, students in López’s class were beginning to recognize the importance of clearly explaining what mathematical steps were taken and why. ",41,Co-Constructing Written Explanations
42,Co-Constructing Written Explanations,"In Skubal’s classroom, students  appreciated that the answer was stated clearly and directly, and that part of the problem was restated to reiterate the importance of reaching a correct conclusion “because he said he didn’t  want to waste any money.” Other students emphasized solving more than one way. One student explained how solving more than one way might be helpful to a reader “ ’cause some people don’t know that way and they might get confused. So they did another way so they don’t get confused ’cause they might know that way.” Students also discussed how solving multiple ways can be more convincing than solving only one way: “Someone might think they did it wrong, so if you show your work, they can see how you did it and it shows that they did it right.” Thus, Skubal’s students cited two different reasons to solve multiple ways, and both included thinking about the audience’s understanding. Skubal’s class also discussed the  use of different visual representations. One group attempted to show the division using base-ten blocks as they had seen in their textbooks. Other students wondered whether the principal would understand this representation or whether he had learned about base-ten blocks when he was in school. Students were also curious about what the blocks meant in the multiplication problems at the bottom of the poster. One student explained that this was another attempt to show the problem using base-ten blocks, and he thought it would help show the place-value meaning of the numbers 121 and 122. Skubal commended her students for experimenting with different ways to show their thinking, allowing the class to consider how these representations might be interpreted by a distant audience. ",42,Co-Constructing Written Explanations
43,Co-Constructing Written Explanations,"Although we were hoping that  students’ explanations would include conceptual justifications, we found that this task elicited mostly procedural explanations and that students in both classes tended not to explain why they divided. Only one poster included, “I divided because I wanted to see how much 1 iPad cost,” and  this did not come up in the class discussion. We imagine most students assumed that it was obvious they divided so they could compare the cost per iPad at each store. The purpose of the task was to help the principal make an important decision, so it makes sense that students’ explanations focused on checking that calculations were correct and explaining how much money he would save by shopping at Best Buy. ",43,Co-Constructing Written Explanations
44,Co-Constructing Written Explanations,STUDENTS AS DOERS AND COMMUNICATORS,44,Co-Constructing Written Explanations
45,Co-Constructing Written Explanations,"The act of co-constructing offered students access to others’ ways of communicating their ideas, paving the way for class discussions about particular features of mathematical explanation that could evolve throughout the year. It is unlikely that students had seen many examples of mathematical explanations like those they were asked to produce in this lesson (Grice 1975; Morgan 1998), and they enacted agency as they experimented with what to include in this new genre. We believe that this lesson contributes to NCTM’s goals of providing all students with access, equity, and empowerment by helping teachers and students see value in the ways they explain their thinking and positioning them as “doers” and “communicators” of mathematics. Making the discourse features of thorough explanations explicit can help all students develop the codes of power necessary for success in future math courses (Schleppegrell 2007). More important, we found that all of our students were capable of contributing to writing and discussing mathemati- “I didn’t know how to say my idea, but my partner knew what I meant and helped me figure out how to write it.” cal explanations, including bilingual learners and those currently struggling in mathematics. In both classrooms, students surprised us by the variety of ways they explained their thinking. Skubal commented, “Now that I’ve seen the great ideas students came up with to make it convincing, I know that they can provide those components on other problems too.” ",45,Co-Constructing Written Explanations
46,Co-Constructing Written Explanations,"After this lesson, we continued  to grapple with several tensions. Although we wanted to encourage students to incorporate more reasoning into their written explanations, we were hesitant to create a cookie-cutter list of items that every explanation needed, in part because our students helped us realize that different tasks require different explanations. For example, it might be contrived to expect students to think that the principal would need an explanation of why students used division. Indeed, it defies the norms of communication to explain something that is already known, and it can even be considered rude (Grice 1975). We continued to explore these issues with students as part of our larger effort of considering what should be included in explanations with different purposes and audiences. ",46,Co-Constructing Written Explanations
47,Co-Constructing Written Explanations,"For other teachers who wish to try  this activity in their classrooms, we suggest incorporating an authentic audience to position written explanations as communicative acts between two parties. We found that students contemplated how the principal would interpret their explanations, and this encouraged them to revise until they thought their ideas were represented clearly. Although the principal read and appreciated the explanations on the posters, we realized that asking the principal to write comments back to the students could have created a more interactive communication experience. We encourage teachers to experiment with collaborative writing in their own  classrooms and build on students’ current understandings of what mathematical explanations look like.",47,Co-Constructing Written Explanations
