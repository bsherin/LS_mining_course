"If asked if this conjecture is true, a  student would probably test it using several examples or perhaps find a counterexample. Examples are powerful tools for understanding mathematics (Watson and Mason 2005), which may be why students often generate examples when trying to understand a mathematical idea. However, finding several examples that work does not prove that a statement is true. For instance, a student may think that the conjecture above is true because it works for the numbers 5, 7, 9, and 11. It is not. One counterexample is 127.",3,mtms2012-04-520a,,
"Reasoning and sense making  should start from the early elementary grades on (CCSSI 2010; NCTM 2000). However, more formal work with mathematical proof typically occurs in high school. To prepare for this work, middle school students should have opportunities to bridge their informal, intuitive ways of reasoning about mathematics to develop arguments that treat the general case.",4,mtms2012-04-520a,,

"Reasoning and Sense Making describes a progression of students’ mathematical reasoning that occurs in three phases: empirical, preformal, and formal (NCTM 2009, pp. 10-11). Empirical reasoning involves generating confirming examples to support a conjecture. Research shows that students at all grade levels rely too much on empirical reasoning when proving. Formal reasoning is what we want all students to achieve. In this phase, students logically justify mathematical statements by applying general statements, definitions, and axioms. The middle, or preformal, stage is often overlooked in teaching reasoning and proving in math classrooms. This stage is described as “the role of intuitive explanations and partial arguments that lend insight into what is happening” (NCTM 2009, p. 10). ",7,mtms2012-04-520a,,
"Middle school teachers can help students engage in preformal reasoning by carefully unpacking examples to reveal the underlying mathematical structures. By carefully using examples, teachers can reveal hidden structure and general patterns, an essential  practice outlined in the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSI 2010). We will describe aspects of middle school students’ empirical reasoning, in particular, the distinction between the productive and unproductive use of examples. We will then provide recommendations for instruction that can guide students toward productive empirical reasoning and the kind of example use that will lead to preformal reasoning.",8,mtms2012-04-520a,,

"The Sum of Three Odd Numbers task was given to approximately 200 seventh-grade students to determine if they could provide formal reasoning to justify the odd sum (see fig. 1). While working with these seventhgrade students, we found that most were in the empirical stage of reasoning. This finding is not surprising; Knuth, Choppin, and Bieda (2009) reported that middle school students tend to show that a statement is true by providing confirming examples. In our analysis, we found that how students generated examples may have influenced whether they could move toward justification. We classified ",10,mtms2012-04-520a,,

Unproductive Use of Examples,17,mtms2012-04-520a,,
"Students overwhelmingly used three examples in their justifications. For example, one student wrote the following response to The Sum of Three Odd Numbers problem: 3 + 5 + 7 = 15 5 + 5 + 5 = 15 1 + 5 + 11 = 17",18,mtms2012-04-520a,,
"The types of examples that students generated show that their computations result in an odd number. When using this method, however, students do not develop a conceptual lever that can later help them formulate a deductive argument to justify the truth of the statement. By finding the sum of odd numbers in one step, students are unable to see the emerging patterns between intermediate sums that correspond to the given statements (odd + odd = even;  even + odd = odd). ",19,mtms2012-04-520a,,
"Instead of providing justification,  students tend to use examples to merely provide answers. Balacheff (1991) noticed that students’ use of examples when proving is tied to their desire to produce an answer rather than communicate knowledge. By approaching the task in this way, students are only able to verify that statements are sometimes true. ",20,mtms2012-04-520a,,
Productive Use of Examples,21,mtms2012-04-520a,,
"Finding mathematical structure by recognizing general patterns when generating examples is an important mathematical practice. The mathematical structure of a problem is revealed when “we carry out several concrete examples of a process that we don’t quite have . . . to find regularity and build a generic algorithm that describes every instance” (Graham, Cuoco, and Zimmermann 2010,   p. 29). That is, as students pay attention to repeated calculations in various examples, they can step back and begin to see general properties of the problem emerge. Although students might not be conceptually ready to write out a formal proof of their ideas, reasoning about general patterns noted in examples indicates a preformal stage of reasoning (NCTM 2009). We discuss two tips for helping students use examples in powerful ways.  teaching tips 1. Scaffold Students’ Use of Examples",22,mtms2012-04-520a,,
"As previously mentioned, the majority of students tend to use examples to test a conjecture, which leads them to confirm the validity of a statement instead of understanding the underlying mathematical relationships. While planning a lesson, it is critical for the teacher to consider ways to scaffold students’ work using examples. To illustrate, we return to the ",23,mtms2012-04-520a,,

To begin, students could be asked to conjecture whether the sum of two odd numbers is odd or even. A visual representation can reinforce ",24,mtms2012-04-520a,,

"Once students have informally justified why the sum of any two odd numbers is even, they can then explore what happens when the third odd number is added. Students may already have learned the “odd plus odd is even” fact from elementary school, but using visual manipulatives or drawings in middle school can help them reason about relationships between odd and even numbers. Decomposing a relatively complicated operation into smaller chunks and using examples to model intermediate steps can reveal the hidden structure of the mathematical idea and promote preformal reasoning.

Students can benefit greatly from a  teacher’s guidance in reasoning from examples in all areas of mathematics. Figure 3 illustrates a problem that can be used when students are learning about properties of special triangles and the Pythagorean theorem. A typical student approach to the Spiraling Triangles problem is to determine the side length of the triangle in one step and then use that result to find the area of the triangle in the next step. Asking students to record their results in a table can help them  recognize the geometric pattern.,29,mtms2012-04-520a,,
"Table 1 shows how the area increases by a factor of 2 for every step. This helps students understand that the expression 2n-1, where n is the step number, gives the area of the triangle in each step. However, to guide students to develop a deeper understanding of the mathematics, teachers can pose this question: “What is the relationship between the side length and the area of each triangle?”",30,mtms2012-04-520a,,
"Students can reference the examples in the table to investigate this relationship. Asking “What do we know about the bases and heights of isosceles right triangles?” will help students see that they can modify the general formula for the area of a triangle for the special case, the area of the isosceles right triangle, to be 1/2 × (side length)2. Students can now be prompted to consider what happens to the value for the area of the isosceles right triangle when the value for the side length is squared. As the equal side lengths increase by a factor of ",31,mtms2012-04-520a,,
"Each step in a science museum’s spiral staircase is an isosceles right triangle whose leg matches the hypotenuse of the previous step, as shown in the overhead view of the staircase. If the first step has an area of 0.5 square feet, what is the area of the nth step? but also generate the following expressions using the law of exponents:",32,mtms2012-04-520a,,
"Since is equivalent to 2, the expression above can be simplified to the area increases by a factor of 2.  As students recognize this relationship, they will be able to not only justify the expression that gives the side length for step n, namely,  to find the area of step n. By having students attend to not only the patterns of growth in the area of the spiraling isosceles triangles but also the patterns of growth in the side  table 1 The area increases by a factor of 2 for every step.",33,mtms2012-04-520a,,
