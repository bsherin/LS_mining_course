Varying the difficulty of the game’s questions and tasks can make the game easier or more difficult. The game board is shown in figure 1, and the rules are  listed in figure 2. The question cards are shown in figure 3, and task cards in figure 4. Note: Question and task cards will be more durable and easier to use if printed on heavy card paper or card stock.

I liked the game. It was fun to roll the dice and play a game in math. It was the most fun when I landed on a 10 or a question. Some of the questions were difficult but I knew most of them. This is my opinion of the game.,26,mtms2007-10-172a,,
"I thought that the game was awesome and I hope we can play it again soon. The only thing I didn’t like as much is that some questions were hard, but hey we need to extend our knowledge. I liked the questions where you have to figure it out because that’s how I learn best.",27,mtms2007-10-172a,,
"I really liked the game Metric Madness. It was fun and educational at the same time. Metric Madness was a clever way to help learn the metric terms and was really fun to do a hands-on activity. I do not have many suggestions for the game but I would suggest the questions be multiple choice. I noticed it was a little difficult for some students, as some of us were clueless to the metric system lingo.",28,mtms2007-10-172a,,
I thought Metric Madness was really fun. I liked that the questions were actually challenging. I also liked that the directions were not very hard. It think the “10” cards could be harder than they were. All around I really liked the game and thought it was fun.,29,mtms2007-10-172a,,
I thought Metric Madness was pretty fun. You work on your math but you also do some science. The question cards really make you think about the answers. The other thing I like is you get to see how much you can remember about science and your math skills. That is what I liked about the game.,30,mtms2007-10-172a,,
