"The purpose of the “Families Ask” department is to help classroom teachers respond to questions commonly asked by caregivers of their students. In each issue, a commonly asked question will be posed; a rationale for the response will be presented for teachers; and a reproducible page will be offered for duplication and distribution to parents,  other caregivers, administrators, or community members—anyone involved in the mathematics education of middle school students.  here is this month’s question:",3,mtms2007-09-88a,,

"The importance of number sense and research documenting students’ struggles with number sense has gained prominence in the past twenty or more years (Post 1981; Reys, Kim, and Bay 1999). Students who have number sense have a better feel for numbers, their meanings and representations, and operations than those lacking this skill. They are also more confident when working with numbers. In addition, they are flexible in their thinking and will often invent their own computational procedures and problem-solving strategies. They are able to judge the reasonableness of solutions and adjust estimates when necessary. ",6,mtms2007-09-88a,,
"According to NCTM (2000), instruction on number and operations for students from prekindergarten through high school should include the following: •	 Understanding number meanings,  ways of representing numbers, relationships among numbers, and number systems •	 Understanding the meanings of  operations, how they relate to one another (referents), and the effect of operations on numbers •	 Making reasonable estimates •	 Computing fluently",7,mtms2007-09-88a,,
"Number and Operations is one  of the five Content Standards. It  provides a foundation for the other four Content Standards of Algebra, Geometry, Measurement, and Data Analysis and Probability. With number sense being an important part of the Number and Operations Standard as a whole, its importance extends to all the Standards.",8,mtms2007-09-88a,,
"Number sense also has the potential to be an enjoyable topic of study. Students are encouraged to make sense of numbers and operations rather than simply perform a set of computational procedures. For example, we use estimation daily: “How long will it take to get to my office or class? How much do these bananas or apples weigh? Will two cans of paint be enough to cover the walls of this room?” We ask these questions on a regular basis. With experience, we get better at these estimates. In the same manner, students can improve their estimation skills by practicing. ",9,mtms2007-09-88a,,
"Making estimation personal to middle school students can help engage them. For example, students can be asked, “Are you more than a million seconds old? How can you find out?” They are interested in thinking about being x number of seconds old, enjoy sharing birth dates with their peers, and are surprised to find just how  (continued on page 90) families ask: take-home page",10,mtms2007-09-88a,,
Families often ask a question like this:,11,mtms2007-09-88a,,
"My child sometimes comes up with answers that do not make sense. how can i help my child recognize that the answer is not reasonable? i “It’s just common sense!” We have  heard people say this often. What we do not hear often enough is “number sense.” When common sense combines with numbers, we call it number sense. Both are part of our daily lives. Number sense stems from having experience with numbers. It allows children and adults to understand many things: the ways numbers are represented; number relationships; number size; and the effect of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Number sense also enables students to apply numbers in useful ways, such as creating more efficient counting and calculating strategies, measuring, and estimating amounts. It also enables people to identify when their answer does not make sense. ",12,mtms2007-09-88a,,
"Just as common sense is developed over time through a variety of real-life experiences, number sense also develops gradually from exploring numbers in many ways. Children begin to develop number sense informally before they go to school. Once in school, they move beyond counting to understanding the size and composition of numbers. They learn that the number 26 is composed of two 10’s and six 1’s and that they can count to 26 faster if they count by 5’s until they get to 25, then add 1. To help students develop number sense, teachers focus instruction on a set of numbers that we call benchmarks. Whole-number benchmarks of 10, 100, and 1000 are used in real-world situations. Other benchmarks, such as 0, 1/2, and 1, help students better understand fractions and decimals. Number sense also refers to a person’s ability to develop strategies for solving problems and to make good mathematical decisions (Reys 1991).  subtraction problems involving fractions. For example, when thirteen-yearolds were asked to estimate the sum of 12/13 and 7/8, they responded in the following way:",13,mtms2007-09-88a,,

"If the students applied number sense to this problem, they would have estimated that 12/13 is almost 1 and that 7/8 is almost 1, so the sum is about 2. However, only 24 percent of the students selected this answer.",17,mtms2007-09-88a,,
"Number sense is an important part of mathematics in school, but it is an even more important part of mathematics in everyday experiences. As a parent, you can help develop your child’s number sense. Encourage him or her to estimate the grocery bill before reaching the checkout. Point out numbers and ask why they are there and what they mean. Play “over and under” games; before driving by the bank’s thermometer, ask whether the temperature will be over or under a certain number. Before making your purchase at the concession stand, ask your child to estimate whether the total will be over or under five dollars. ",18,mtms2007-09-88a,,
Number sense continues to develop  in people of all ages. It is used often in games and puzzles that involve strategically placing numbers in boxes. Number sense also abounds on such game shows as The Price Is Right. ,19,mtms2007-09-88a,,
"These types of games bring out the playful nature of numbers. Over time, number sense as well as common sense will develop.",20,mtms2007-09-88a,,

"In middle school, students work with problems that involve fractions and decimals. Students need to understand the meaning of the numerator and denominator, the size of the parts represented by a fraction, and the size of the fraction compared with another fraction. Consider comparing the fractions 2/9 and 9/10. A student must understand that 2/9 represents something divided into 9 equal pieces, of which 2 would be less than half the number of pieces. The fraction 9/10 represents something divided into 10 equal pieces, of which 9 would be more than half the number of pieces. The fraction 9/10 is close to 1, which would be represented by the fraction 10/10. The student could identify 9/10 as being the larger fraction without having to use the traditional approach of finding a common denominator. Although such procedures result in a correct answer, students often calculate without considering the value of the fractions. When comparing 4/9 and 7/9, students use number sense when they determine that 7/9 is a greater fraction because it has more of the same-sized parts. The rationale is that the fractions represent objects cut into the same number and size of pieces but that 7 pieces are more than 4. When comparing 4/5 with 4/9, students use number sense to determine that 4/5 is greater because it has the same number of parts but different sizes. Fifths would be larger than ninths, so four larger pieces (4/5) would be more.",23,mtms2007-09-88a,,
Teaching number sense has become more important since researchers have investigated how well students use this type of thinking. A study showed that students often do not use number sense to estimate the answer to addition and  from the September 2007 issue of families ask continued from page 88 many seconds old they are in reality.,24,mtms2007-09-88a,,
"Students move from estimation to  computation in the process of finding out just how many seconds old they are and discuss and rationalize their original estimates. Some convert years to days, hours to minutes, and minutes to seconds. Others try shortcuts, use calculators, and convert months to weeks to days to hours. Throughout this process, students think rigorously about the best way to arrive at their age in seconds, discuss their methods with peers, and share results.",25,mtms2007-09-88a,,
"Middle school students have a strong  sense of being a part of a group. The groups may differ, but students want to be reassured that they are normal. In studying numbers and patterns, they can explore what is happening to others like themselves. For example, they can research data through various media and create a class project titled “Kids Like Us.” They might be surprised to find out that the majority of students in  the United States or the world share a bedroom with another family member or that most middle schoolers are not allowed to date. They gain insight into the role of data (numbers) in the world, in marketing, and in the media. They can learn how numbers are used in our culture to influence young people or to market products to them. This is a very human use of number sense.",26,mtms2007-09-88a,,
"We study mathematics not just  for its relevance to our daily lives but also to imagine what we cannot hold or see. Although numbers are used to describe our galaxy, they are so large that most of us cannot imagine the enormity. Although many of us may wish we had a million dollars, we do not know offhand what size container to bring should someone offer us a million one-dollar bills. These are large numbers; sometimes we speak of them growing exponentially rather than in a straight-line fashion. Whether introducing large or miniscule numbers, calculations, estimations, or their interrelationships, we can be assured that beginning with meaningful contexts, like being human, will result in student interest, engagement, and success.
