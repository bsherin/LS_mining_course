"T he  joys  of  working  with  middle   school students in a mathematics classroom may be tempered by the challenge of meeting external expectations. however, it is possible to carefully design and implement a lesson that both embodies the spirit of Principles and Standards for School Mathematics (nCtm 2000) and meets the needs  set  forth  by  our  state  assessments.  such  a lesson can address a big mathematical idea through related activities that develop skills and concepts, involve reasoning and writing, and help students use mathematics in the world around them.",2,mtms2007-02-300a,,
"in this article, we offer an example of such a lesson. we engaged students in grades 6 through 8 to look  at  area  as  a  concept  that  transcends  familiar common  formulas  and  relates  to  linear  measure. we share our experiences of how we developed stations, introduced the lesson, facilitated group work, and  orchestrated  whole-class  discussion.  we  use the word lesson to refer to the total experience for the students, from the introduction through the discussion.  Station  will  refer  to  a  set  of  related  tasks undertaken by students using a shared set of materials, and task will be a single mathematical question or problem.",3,mtms2007-02-300a,,

"Choosing the Station Tasks we  want  our  stations  to  Consist  of  tasks that  encourage  students  to  meet  our  lesson  goal: understanding  area  and  its  relationship  to  linear measure.  the  tasks  need  to  fit  the  purpose  of  the station,  and  the  stations  need  to  fit  the  purpose  of the  lesson.  each  of  the  three  stations,  titled  area of  dauphin  County,  tower  Placement,  and  who’s Correct?  (see  the  Appendix),  contribute  a  different aspect of linear measure or area measure to the lesson. each station uses cell phone technology as a context in which students work with these mathematical concepts.",5,mtms2007-02-300a,,
"at the first station, titled area of dauphin County, students  explore  area  using  large  laminated  maps of  dauphin  County,  Pennsylvania  (fig.  1),  the county in which they live. the laminated maps are drawn to scale on 1-inch grid paper (see the map for the scale). students develop estimation strategies to determine an approximate area for a nonpolygonal shape, such as the outline of this county.",6,mtms2007-02-300a,,
"at the tower Placement station, students determine the number and placement of the fewest cell phone towers necessary in dauphin County to ensure that all towns shown on the map have cell phone coverage.  using  what  we  developed  and  called  a “tower  tool”  (fig.  2),  a  pencil  with  long  and  short plastic extenders, students focus on the center and radius of circular coverage areas. students place the pencil’s eraser where a tower would be positioned and  rotate  the  pencil.  the  short  and  long  plastic “arms” trace circular coverage regions representing an industry standard of 1 mile and 2 miles from the tower, respectively. a town has service when it is in ",7,mtms2007-02-300a,,

"Materials, Timing, and Logistics we  arrange  the  station  loCations  before class starts, duplicating stations as needed, to have one  for  every  three  to  five  students.  the  groups usually work for twenty minutes before moving to another station or before moving the station materials to another group in a predetermined pattern. (the Appendix contains a list of suggested materials  for  each  station.)  at  each  station,  we  place  a folder  for  students’  finished  work  and  borrow  a digital  camera  to  photograph  their  work  with  the tower tools and large maps. the folders and camera allow us to easily capture or save students’ work for use  in  the  poststation  whole-group  discussion.  we plan how we will support student learning without prematurely  leading  students  to  desired  solution strategies or specific conclusions. we do more than simply provide substantial time for students to work on  the  task.  we  plan  questions  that  help  students verbalize any approaches or initial ideas they have; why their approaches or ideas made sense to them in  relationship  to  the  task;  and  what,  if  any,  flaws they  see  in  their  approaches  or  ideas.  we  keep  in mind that the stations are learning experiences and  decide what we will look for in the station work and how we will use what we see as learning continues in whole-class discussion following the stations. the poststation discussion supports the lesson goal; we do not expect students to develop deep understanding without reflecting on their work at the stations. we  elaborate  on  the  whole-group  discussion  after some  comments  about  introducing  the  cell  phone context and implementing the stations.",17,mtms2007-02-300a,,
"Introducing the Lesson at  the  start  of  the  Class,  we  introduCe  the  lesson  context  to  students  and  allow  them  to briefly share their experiences with cell phones. as a class, we look at pictures of cell towers in our community and refer to the “bars” that appear on a cell phone and in television and print advertisements as a way to explain coverage areas and towers. when talking about coverage area, we note that cell phone businesses expect the phones to work well within 1 mile of a tower and within 2 miles of a tower under many  conditions.  since  companies  do  not  want  to buy, rent, or maintain more towers than necessary, we pose to students the challenge of placing towers so that they will serve as many customers as possible without overlapping service. we show students the map of the county (fig. 1), asking them to locate their school community. we also introduce them to the tower tool (fig. 2) and explain how to rotate the pencil on its eraser to have the plastic strips mark off  coverage  areas  on  the  large  dauphin  County maps with 1-mile and 2-mile radii.  having established the context, we move this initial whole-group conversation to mathematical matters that students will need to address to work on the stations. we ask students to discuss what area means to them. (we will return to these responses during  the  end-of–class  discussion.)  the  students also discuss familiar mathematical ideas, including scale  and  its  relevance  to  interpreting  maps.  we ask  them  to  connect  what  they  say  about  scale  to the length of the “arms” of the tower tool and the size of the large laminated maps compared with the size  of  the  map  that  appears  in  their  worksheets. we talk with students about what constitutes good written explanations of mathematical thinking.  we also comment on resources and materials that students  will  be  using  in  the  stations.  for  example, students sometimes do not realize that the dots on the maps, and not the words, indicate the location of the towns. we suggest ways of displaying answers for the tower Placement station, such as marking locations  for  1-mile  coverage  areas  with  one  color or symbol and 2-mile coverage areas with another color or symbol.",18,mtms2007-02-300a,,
"Monitoring the Stations as  students  begin  their  work  at  the  sta- tions, we look for particular topics to draw into a poststation discussion. we informally assess individual understanding as it surfaces, such as whether students see “area” as a measure of surface covered and how they develop counting strategies or fluently recall and use appropriate area formulas. we also advise and assist students while providing encouragement, stimulating thought, diagnosing difficulties, playing devil’s advocate, or helping students reflect on their work. to promote  reflection,  we  prompt  students  to  describe how their strategies changed as they worked and what happened to cause them to change their strategies.",19,mtms2007-02-300a,,
"the purpose of the stations is not simply to have students write correct answers on their papers but to have them gather ideas and experience mathematics that  enrich  students  so  they  can  contribute  to  and learn from a poststation discussion. while monitoring  group  work,  we  keep  in  mind  the  content  and processes emphasized in each station and our goal of having students better understand area measure and its  relationship  to  linear  measure.  we  decide  what student work is vital, and the groups are told that they will be asked to share their ideas. we remind them to explain their reasoning and strategies, and we ask some groups to preserve their work for use in the discussion. we also remind students to check for group members’ understanding of solutions and reasoning.",20,mtms2007-02-300a,,
"The  Area  of  Dauphin  County  Station.  Coming into this lesson, students may know how to find the area of polygons using formulas and breaking complicated polygons into familiar ones, but they do not know how to find areas of irregular shapes like the dauphin County outline. because learning how to approximate the area of nonpolygonal shapes is a  focus  of  this  station,  strategies  to  determine  the area of the county’s shape will definitely matter in the  poststation  whole-group  discussion.  we  mentally take note of student strategies and analyze how these  strategies  are  mathematically  different.  for example, some students may count the number of complete blocks enclosed by the outline of the county and others may count portions of blocks within the outline. both these approaches involve counting, but the latter requires work with noninteger values.",21,mtms2007-02-300a,,
"we  also  look  for  unusual  and  common  solution strategies  that  might  contribute  to  the  poststation discussion. we think about what groups of students will  share  their  strategies  and  the  order  in  which the  sharing  will  unfold.  we  silently  note  how  answers  generated  by  alternative  solution  strategies differ numerically and how these differences relate to the strategies used. for example, counting portions of blocks produces a numerical answer that is both closer to the actual area and greater than the answer produced by counting only the whole blocks enclosed by the county outline. we save these ideas for our students’ poststation discussion of the effects of the strategies on the resulting answers.",22,mtms2007-02-300a,,
"because  we  assume  that  students  are  building strategies for nonpolygonal shapes from their previous work with familiar polygons, we are ready to ask questions about how they might use and vary known strategies by focusing on what they can do and how they find this task challenging. we pose such questions as these: for what shapes can you find the area? how is finding the area of those shapes easier than finding the area of the county’s shape? we also might pose  questions  to  motivate  students  to  make  estimates based on known figures: how, if at all, could you change this county’s shape slightly to resemble the area of a familiar shape for which you could determine the area? how would the area of that familiar shape be different from the area of this shape?",23,mtms2007-02-300a,,
"The Tower Placement Station. students are familiar with circles and circular regions. they should know the radius of a circle as a distance. however, students  may  not  have  an  immediate  method  for “covering”  a  region  with  a  minimal  number  of  circular regions. instead of focusing on the diversity of student approaches as we did for the area of dauphin County, we look for how student strategies for placing towers might evolve as students relax the conditions or restrictions they impose on the task. for example, students  often  start  by  placing  a  tower  on  a  town. they next typically have one tower serve two towns by placing the tower halfway between two towns or at some other point on the segment joining two towns. eventually, student thinking tends to move from “use one tower to cover two towns” to “try to cover three or more towns with one tower,” and students relax the  implied  condition  that  towers  need  to  be  “on the  line”  between  two  towns.  this  movement  from thinking linearly about two towns to thinking regionally about three or more noncollinear towns is at the heart of separating distance or length from area. we support  the  evolution  of  their  strategies  by  asking students to reflect on their work at the station and in the poststation discussion. we pose questions such as these: you placed the tower here and then there. what made you think to move it? what are the benefits of one of these places over the other?",24,mtms2007-02-300a,,
"The Who’s Correct? Station. students should be able to measure distances on the large maps, understand radius as a distance, and convert between different scales or units of measure, but they may not be fluent in applying a combination of these ideas in ",25,mtms2007-02-300a,,
"Vol. 12, no. 6  .  februar y 2007   303 this movement from thinking linearly about tWo toWns to thinking regionally about three or more nonCollinear toWns is at the heart of seParating distanCe or length from area reasoning through an answer to a real-world problem  and  articulating  their  solution  in  writing.  we watch for how their solution strategies may differ in terms of the materials they use. for example, some students might use a ruler to measure the distance from harrisburg to each particular town and compare these measures converted to miles to the given seven miles while other students may use string to mark  off  the  circular  region  representing  all  locations that are within seven miles of harrisburg. we think about how the use of different materials relates to underlying mathematical ideas. for example, the string in who’s Correct? and the tower tool in tower Placement  are  both  instances  of  using  a  device  to denote a fixed point (center) and distance (radius) to define a circle, making these materials variations on the use of compasses to construct circles.",26,mtms2007-02-300a,,
"to  support  students  as  they  bring  existing knowledge into their work, we ask them what they know that might be relevant to the given task. we encourage  them  to  talk  within  groups  about  the materials and how these things might relate to the problem.  to  support  their  writing,  we  watch  for students’  interpretations  of  the  task  statement.  in particular, we listen for how they interpret the mathematically imprecise phrase, “7 miles from harrisburg.”  (this  phrase  appeared  in  the  task  because we made a simple error when designing the activity  sheet.)  students  might  deal  with  whether  they count harrisburg as one of the towns that is within  2 miles. students may debate whether the wording of the task means they should look for towns that are exactly 7 miles or at most 7 miles from harrisburg,  a notion that can be tied to thinking about points on a circle versus points within a circular region. after we saw the possibility in the classroom for intense discussion  about  precise  wording,  we  discussed changing  the  task  but  decided  to  use  the  original wording  for  subsequent  classes  to  bring  students’ attention to the importance of clarity in writing. we encourage  students  to  critique  their  writing  (and ours) and to attend to mathematical clarity as they read their peers’ written responses.",27,mtms2007-02-300a,,
"Discussion and Closure the  final  Phase  of  this  lesson  Combines  a whole-group discussion about the work completed at the stations and students’ culminating questions about  area  and  linear  measure  across  stations.  as we discuss the stations, we keep in mind our intended lesson goal: understanding area and its relationships to linear measure.

"Discussion of the Stations to  inCrease  the  likelihood  that  students will make appropriate mathematical connections during this part of the lesson, we purposefully decide the order in which groups will share their ideas and solutions. we recognize the possibility that all groups may not be able to share their solutions for various reasons,  including  duplicate  solutions  and  limited time. we believe that sharing strategies should proceed from relatively simplistic or familiar mathematics to more complex or new mathematics, depending on the work produced by the students. for example, while  working  with  the  area  of  dauphin  County, some groups began by drawing one large rectangle around the county, determined the area of that rectangle,  then  adjusted  that  area  by  either  adding  or subtracting  smaller  areas  of  the  rectangle,  depending on whether the actual county outline fell inside or outside the drawn rectangle (fig. 3). this simplistic solution led to estimation, which in turn led to less accurate results than other methods. other groups chose to draw multiple rectangles within and around the county. this more complex strategy requires less estimation and results in a more accurate solution.",29,mtms2007-02-300a,,
"students’  group  work  at  the  tower  Placement station  often  demonstrates  varying  levels  of  mathematics. for some students, deeper understanding may result from questioning and sharing during the poststation  discussion.  for  example,  some  groups have  a  more  simplistic  solution  that  involves  placing the towers only directly on the towns, whereas other  groups  placed  towers  strategically  among several towns. the more complex solution requires fewer towers. we also ask students to share unique ",30,mtms2007-02-300a,,
Fig. 4  The “tower tool” illustrated the area between two points.,31,mtms2007-02-300a,,
"in the area of dauphin County, we might ask how it is possible that group a’s area is less than group b’s area when both groups used methods that made sense.  we  also  ask  questions  that  challenge  students to justify answers agreed on by the class. a mathematically  relevant  question  for  tower  Placement  might  be  this:  why  is  the  smallest  number of  cell  phone  towers  placed  on  the  map  using  the  2-mile radius not the same as twice the smallest number using the 1-mile radius? these questions elicit students’  further  reflection  on  mathematical  ideas without a teacher doing the thinking for them.",32,mtms2007-02-300a,,
"Culminating Questions across Stations in  addition  to  disCussing  PartiCular  stations,  we  use  several  culminating  questions  to help students make key mathematical connections among their experiences and their thinking across the three stations. we pose two questions that address area and its relationship to linear measure:  1.  at the beginning of the class, you were asked what area means in mathematics. has your answer to that question changed in any way? if so, how? 2.  what are the similarities and differences between linear measure and area measure based on your work with the three stations? we believe that this pair of questions elicits the underlying mathematics for the lesson goal. for example, in our experience, the majority of the students typically claim that area means “length times width” or “base times height” at the start of the lesson. students associate area with formulas for rectangles or triangles. however,  at  this  point  in  the  lesson,  most  students recognize  that  area  of  an  irregular  shape  involves more than a formula. the second question prompts students  to  reflect  on  their  new  understandings  ",33,mtms2007-02-300a,,

"yet mathematically relevant work. for example, one group demonstrated how they used two tower tools to  locate  the  point  that  was  halfway  between  two towns (fig. 4). they placed one tower tool on each of two cities to show how the tools met exactly at the location where they placed a tower and that points representing this location and the two towns were collinear.  this  visual  image  was  a  powerful  representation of midpoint.",36,mtms2007-02-300a,,
"it  is  crucial  for  the  teacher  to  facilitate  the  discussion so that students can identify important similarities and differences in their solutions and overall thinking.  although  we  believe  that  mathematical connections ideally should come from students, we sometimes need to point out specific commonalities and differences to inspire discussion. for example,  of  area  measure  and  linear  measure. at  this  point  in  the  lesson,  students typically communicate that area is associated with coverage, whereas linear measure  is  associated  with  distance and  that  area  for  a  2-mile  radius  is not double the area of a 1-mile radius. they  recognize  that  linear  measurements  are  necessary  for  using  area formulas.  they  also  connect  the  notion of midpoint to the center of a segment created by two radii as a result of reflecting on their use of tower tools at the tower Placement station. in addition, these questions assess the effectiveness of the lesson, which can help in planning the next steps of instruction for this class and in implementing this lesson with future classes.",37,mtms2007-02-300a,,
