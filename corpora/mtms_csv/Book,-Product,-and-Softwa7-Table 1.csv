5,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (December 2014) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Karen Karp and Amy Roth McDuffie, eds., 2014. 260 pp., $42.95 paper. ISBN 9780873537612. Stock no. 14774. National Council of Teachers of Mathematics; www.nctm.org.",,
6,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (December 2014) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","The goal of Annual Perspectives in Mathematics Education (APME) aligns with the core of NCTMs mission, the improvement of teaching through research-based approaches. In keeping with this goal, the books twenty-four chapters are organized into five parts: Change; Problem Solving; Reasoning, Explaining, and Discourse; Seeing Structure and Generalizing; and Assessment for Teaching and Learning. These topics are broad enough to attract a wide variety of readers, including researchers and those who teach pre-Kgrade 16 students.",,
7,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (December 2014) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Given that the focus of APME is using research to improve instruction, it is important to note that APME provides a brief description of the studies methodologies in most chapters but focuses on their implications. For example, chapter 8 includes questioning prompts for each mathematical practice from CCSSM that teachers can use to facilitate the development of students strategic competence. Design guidelines for modifying mathematical tasks for use with preservice teachers, described in chapter 18, will benefit educators who are interested in using such tasks in their courses. Chapter 24 also describes specific practices that enhanced the development of teachers beliefs and students mathematical thinking through embedded field experiences.",,
8,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (December 2014) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","The APME preface provides a description of the unique history of APME and the strict peer-review process for each chapter. Those who want to select chapters that are most valuable to them will be motivated to read the title of each chapter, which describes well the main issues of the content. All the chapters in APME will be of interest to an audience who wants to read a wide range of perspectives on timely topics in learning and teaching mathematics.",,

15,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (December 2014) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","This is a history book, math book, and art portfolio all in one. The authors state in the preface that our book is meant to be enjoyed, pure and simple.",,
16,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (December 2014) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Tackling subjects that span the course of history, from ancient times to modern day, their chosen classical mathematic topics are briefly  explained and then artistically represented. The authors point out that they purposely did not place proofs in an appendix, write in great technical detail, or even cite other sources. From the preface one learns that the intended audience is high school and college students, mathematics and science teachers, university instructors, and laypersons who are not afraid of an occasional formula or equation.",,
17,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (December 2014) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Although these groups have the most to gain from this book, some topics would appeal to middle school students (for example, perfect and triangular numbers, the Pythagorean theorem, line designs, and Sierpinskis triangle). Even my preschool-aged son enjoyed looking at the pictures and identifying patterns.",,
18,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (December 2014) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","To be clear, this is not a textbook. It presents as a coffee-table book for mathematicians and would be a good addition to a classroom library, available for students of all ages to explore. Those who are able to digest the mathematics, can, and those who cannot (particularly younger students), will be able to enjoy the art, the colors, the designs, and the patterns, and perhaps be exposed to sophisticated ideas to which they will later return. They may be inspired to create art of their own or begin to look for the mathematics that exists all around us in the world.",,

24,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (December 2014) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Its All Relative is designed for educators of grades 67 who have a desire to assist their students in developing a conceptual understanding of ratios and proportions. The book is a flipchart with thirty easily accessible modules of increasing difficulty. Modules are structured with mathematical focus, potential challenges and misconceptions, lesson thoughts, and meeting individual needs. Following the modules is an appendix with reproducible activity sheets for each section.",,
25,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (December 2014) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Because the modules begin by listing potential challenges and misconceptions, teachers can keep them in mind as they read through the lesson. Included in each module is a sample classroom session, called in the classroom, that allows the reader to experience how a lesson might play out during a typical class. Because of this, I believe this book would be especially helpful to teachers who are new to grades 67 mathematics. Ideas for scaffolding and extension are included at the end of each activity, making the activities customizable to students specific needs.",,
26,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (December 2014) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics",Its All Relative is a relevant and easily accessible resource for teachers of grades 67 mathematics. Beginning and veteran teachers alike will appreciate the rigorous and easily customizable activities for any type of classroom setting. I recommend this book for teachers who are looking for ways to deepen and enrich student understanding of ratios and proportions. I look forward to completing many of the activities in this book with my students this year.,,

32,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (December 2014) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","When reading this book, I was a bit uninterested because I was not learning anything new. I have been teaching for sixteen years, so maybe this book is better suited for a person who is in college and learning how to become a teacher. It would be a good book for a college student or a new teacher.",,
33,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (December 2014) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","I had already been aware of the examples used in chapter 3, which are geared toward teaching math. The material was not new or exciting. This book just touches on ideas for math teachers, science teachers, and technology teachers, but it does not make any claims that an experienced teacher would gain new ideas from.",,
34,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (December 2014) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","I would love to see the technology chapter give examples of innovative computer programs (or apps) and show how they can be applied to teaching middle school math. On a side note, on the back panel, I found it interesting that the teacher of the deaf wrote, I was thrilled to find a book that made me feel that I could teach math, science, and technology without needing to be extremely proficient in, or even fascinated by the subjects.",,
