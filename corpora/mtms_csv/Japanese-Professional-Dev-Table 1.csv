0,Japanese Professional Development - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"With international exams (PISA and TIMSS) producing results every three or four years, there is near continual talk of East Asian dominance in mathematics education. Beyond the reporting of scores, some studies have compared mathematics teaching in these countries with U.S. instruction (Hiebert et al. 2003; Stigler and Hiebert 1999). However, researchers are not (usually) grade school math teachers and are often interested in different issues and see different things than teachers. In all these discussions of scores and findings, little interaction has occurred between U.S. math teachers and East Asian math teachers, an interaction that could provide another level of insight in these conversations.",,
1,Japanese Professional Development - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In this article, we report the experiences of two U.S. mathematics teachers, accompanied by a U.S. mathematics educator, who spent a week in Japan visiting with teachers, watching lessons, engaging in lesson study conversations, and talking with mathematics education professors.",,
2,Japanese Professional Development - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,LESSON STUDY,,
3,Japanese Professional Development - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Lesson study, or jugyo kenkyu, is a common method of Japanese professional development (PD). There is not one set way to implement the lesson study process. Lesson study usually involves a teacher preparing a lesson, teaching the lesson in the presence of observers, and then discussing openly the quality of the lesson, so that all participants can learn about teaching mathematics. There are many variations of the lesson study process. For example, sometimes a single teacher will prepare the lesson to be observed, whereas at other times, a group of teachers will work together over a year to develop and refine a lesson. The common elements of all the lesson study variations we experienced were (1) a detailed lesson plan to share with observers, containing background information about the lesson and any particular features of teaching they were trying to better understand; (2) a group of teachers and other professionals observing the lesson in an actual classroom of students; and (3) a meeting afterward where the teacher and observers could discuss the important aspects of the lesson.",,
4,Japanese Professional Development - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,ONE JAPANESE EXPERIENCE,,
5,Japanese Professional Development - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Most of our time was spent in the Tokyo metropolitan area, but one day was spent in a smaller city in the Yamanashi prefecture. Our activitiesincluded attending an elementary school lesson study conference. At such conferences, many teachers gather at one school and lessons are taught (to actual students) at various grades and then discussed. There is also a plenary session with talks for the participants. Lesson study conferences are organized by districts, cities, prefectures (states), and the national education ministries. Teachers may be encouraged to go but it is not required. It is common for teachers to attend about five conferences each year. A teacher who attends may be asked by the principal to report to the other teachers about what happened at the conference and what he or she learned.",,
6,Japanese Professional Development - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,This annotated list describes the activities that the authors engaged in while visiting Japan:,,
7,Japanese Professional Development - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Attended a teacher math circle with six elementary school teachers where we discussed math teaching in the two countries. Teacher math circles are voluntary meetings, usually in the evening, where small groups of teachers get together to plan lessons, discuss ideas, and learn from one another.",,
8,Japanese Professional Development - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Observed eight other lessons during the week in junior high schools and discussed the lessons afterward.,,
9,Japanese Professional Development - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Helped to modify a lesson with a junior high teacher and then observed and discussed the lesson afterward in a formal lesson study discussion.,,
10,Japanese Professional Development - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING AND PD,,
11,Japanese Professional Development - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We learned several lessons from our experiences in Japan. We describe some of the lessons here in the form of principles that could be used in our teaching, collaboration, and professional development. Some of these ideas are in sharp contrast to what we have experienced in our PD in the United States, whereas others are elements of the more effective PD sessions in which we have been involved.",,
12,Japanese Professional Development - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,PD with Actual Students Adds Depth,,
13,Japanese Professional Development - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In the United States, teachers do not often get to observe an experienced teacher implement high-quality lessons in real time with a classroom of actual students. Yet this is a key feature for PD in Japan. The lesson study conference that we attended was a remarkable experience, mainly because of the experience of watching carefully planned lessons, implemented by experienced instructors, with many other interested teachers, being taught to a class of actual students. The aspects of teaching that can be learned by observing (and then discussing) actual lessons with real students helps teachers understand details of a specific lesson as well as general principles that can be applied to other lessons. For example, watching many students work on a task and noting the different approaches that the students are taking helps to better understand student mathematical thinking. Observing the sequencein which the teacher asks students to share their solutions and how the teacher is able to make connections between the solutionswill help observers understand how mathematical ideas can be developed in a class discussion. Just talking about teaching ideas in general, or how students learn in general, which often happens in PD in the United States, does not have the same learning potential as a shared lesson observation in real time. Although general ideas about teaching and learning are addressed in the lesson study discussion afterward, the actual lesson or the responses of actual students are used to illustrate or discuss the general ideas.",,
14,Japanese Professional Development - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Learning Is the Goal and Mathematical Thinking Is the Key,,
15,Japanese Professional Development - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"All the teaching activities and PD work we experienced in Japan were focused on student learning. The teachers, including those observing, were carefully attuned to the goal of the lesson and what it would take to achieve the goal. Observing evidence of student mathematical thinking (verbal response, individual written work, shared work on board, and so on) was the primary way that the effectiveness of the lesson was evaluated. Main themes in lesson study discussions were the connections between students prior knowledge and the goal of the lesson; and how the activities, questions, and teacher moves facilitated students achieving the goals. An analysis of the connections between teacher actions and the mathematical thinking of students seemed to constantly guide Japanese teachers in their teaching decisions.",,
16,Japanese Professional Development - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,This principle is illustrated by a teacher exploring Eulers formula with seventh graders:,,
17,Japanese Professional Development - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"For a polyhedron (with no holes), the sum of the number of faces and vertices is always two more than the number of edges (F + V = E + 2).",,
18,Japanese Professional Development - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The teacher wanted students to do more than just learn the formula but have some way to reason, at their level, about why Eulers formula holds for all polyhedra (with no holes). His goal was getting students to do serious mathematical thinking. He knew that students would not understand a detailed proof of this theorem. Before the lesson, he asked for our input; we discussed ways of reasoning about the faces, edges, and vertices and came upon some reasoning that students could engage in to justify, at least in part, why the formula holds. The reasoning involved the idea of cutting off a corner (vertex) of an existing polyhedron and analyzing the change in the number of faces, edges, and vertices.",,
19,Japanese Professional Development - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Sharing Lesson Plans Increases Learning Opportunities,,
20,Japanese Professional Development - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Japanese teachers are often sharing lesson plans and modifying other lesson plans for their own use. The textbooks in Japan are not the main source of classroom tasks or lesson examples for teachers (although they are carefully studied by the teachers). Many of the tasks and activities that Japanese teachers implement come from (or are adapted from) colleagues and through printed resources. These lesson plans and task descriptions, however, are not viewed as make-and-take lessons for teachers to try whole cloth in their own classrooms. Instead, the lesson plans contain detailed background information about the problem, how it fits in the particular unit, and how the specific questions are used to elicit students mathematical thinking at specific times. It is this detail that allows teachers to better understand their craft as mathematics teachers, and in turn, adapt the lesson to work with their particular goals and their particular students.",,
21,Japanese Professional Development - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,The program of the lesson study conference that we attended included a three-page lesson plan for every lesson taught at the conference. We were impressed with the tasks used in the lessons that we saw. (An abbreviated version of a translated lesson plan from that conference appears in the Appendix. The full lesson plan can be found with this article online at http://www.nctm.org/mtms. See the More4U box at the end of this article.) The tasks can be implemented in different ways to emphasize different mathematics or achieve different or multiple goals. The desire for these tasks and lessons is such that shelves of books of polished lesson plans and deep descriptions can be found in typical bookstores. Teachers buy these books to study and use in their classes.,,
22,Japanese Professional Development - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Collaboration Builds a Shared Knowledge Base for Teaching,,
23,Japanese Professional Development - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The teaching system in Japan promotes a lot of collaboration, both day to day and in more formal PD opportunities, like lesson study. Teachers do not have their own classrooms but share an office with other teachers in their discipline or all other teachers in the school. Some teachers periodically meet in evening math circles with other teachers and professionals (district supervisors, professors) to discuss issues of teaching, get feedback on lessons, hear presentations from invited guests, and so on.",,
24,Japanese Professional Development - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"All this collaboration promotes a shared understanding of teaching and a shared language for talking about teaching ideas. We got the sense that all the teachers had a fairly good idea of what a really good lesson looked like. This culture of collaboration and learning together was perceived to be much stronger in Japan than in the United States. Although we have seen this culture growing here with professional learning communities and other efforts, it is in stark contrast to the traditional teaching culture in which teachers talk little about the specifics of teaching particular topics, staying in their own rooms, and who are periodically trained in PD by outside experts.",,
25,Japanese Professional Development - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The high level of collaboration helps to share powerful ideas in teaching. This is illustrated in the language that teachers have for teaching. There are words that Japanese math teachers use that are unknown to the lay public or common words used with different meanings. For example, teachers distinguish between two different kinds of problems in a lesson, mondai and kadai. The mondai is what we typically think of as a math problem, a kind of question or word problem that students can solve and that usually has a numeric answer. The kadai is a deeper mathematical question that focuses on articulating key mathematical connections or understanding. For example, a mondai might be this: Are these two triangles congruent? A kadai of a lesson might be this: What is the minimum amount of information needed about two triangles to know that they are congruent? To the Japanese, answering the kadai is the real point of the lesson; mondai are used to help students developed the ideas well enough to answer the kadai.",,
26,Japanese Professional Development - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Professionals Working Hard to Be the Best Teachers Possible,,
27,Japanese Professional Development - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Japanese teachers portrayed themselves as professionals in many ways. Not only were they dressed well and very respectful in meetings, but what portrayed their professionalism the most was their deep love of teaching, their strong desire to become the best teachers they could be, and their intricate knowledge of their craft.",,
28,Japanese Professional Development - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,A prime example of the professionalism of Japanese teachers and the system that they work in is the lesson study conference previously mentioned. Everything we saw highlighted the high level of dedication in learning the craft of teaching mathematics. There were hundreds of teachers on a Saturday attending the conference on their own time and paying registration with their own money. They attended because they were confident that it would be a great learning experience.,,
29,Japanese Professional Development - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"There seemed to be a commitment to have the best possible PD opportunity for these teachers. This included full classrooms of public school students for the guest teachers to teach actual lessons, conference programs that included detailed lesson plans for every lesson taught at the conference, and time for teachers to discuss with other teachers the messy details of teaching mathematics but in the context of specific lessons. All are important features of the conference that help teachers hone their craft.",,
30,Japanese Professional Development - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Perhaps the most significant feature we saw was the type of work that teachers engaged in day to day. They did not seem to engage with these principles only in professional development opportunities, but in their everyday work of teaching. They think daily about how students think mathematically and how they would like them to think, they study teaching materials and other teachers lessons daily to develop or find rich tasks to develop that thinking, they write out lesson plans daily (although not always with the detail of the lesson study lesson plans), and they discuss the details of lessons with their colleagues daily. All of these activities produce many opportunities to improve a teachers knowledge and practice.",,
31,Japanese Professional Development - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,WHAT WE ARE DOING NOW,,
32,Japanese Professional Development - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Professional learning opportunities that incorporate these principles could be implemented in different ways, either from grass-roots efforts by teachers or by district-led programs. One of the authors has organized a lesson study group with other teachers at his junior high and surrounding schools. Three teachers took a turn implementing the same lesson in three consecutive periods; about ten teachers and teacher educators were present for the observations and discussions. This was the first of what is intended to be an ongoing lesson study group. It is the only such group that we are aware of in our state. This job-embedded professional development brings advantages that other forms of PD cannot provide.",,
33,Japanese Professional Development - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We provided a lesson study conference experience at a statewide NCTM affiliate conference. We asked to have two sessions back to back, a total of two hours, to engage teachers in the lesson study activity. To teach an actual lesson to actual students, one of the teachers offered extra credit to his ninth-grade students to come for a forty-fiveminute lesson on the Saturday morning of the conference. In the first twenty-five minutes, teacher-participants were introduced to the goal of the lesson and the task. They then helped to make key decisions in the way the lesson would be implemented. The twenty-four students were then brought in for the lesson with the teacher-participants, who observed, took notes, and carefully watched students as they worked on the task and discussed ideas with their partners. The students were then released to go home, and the remaining time was used to discuss specific issues that arose in the lesson and how the choices made about implementation impacted the lesson. The discussion developed at least one instructional principle that teachers could apply to many other lessons. Many of the participants in this mini lesson study experience commented that they never get an opportunity to discuss the craft of teaching mathematics in such detail, and it was very refreshing and meaningful to do so.",,
34,Japanese Professional Development - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"It would be our hope to see PD activities that incorporate these principles, like lesson study groups or lesson study conference sessions, become more common. Professional development with multiple teachers focusing on lessons taught in real time to actual students, with a focus on rich tasks that promote student mathematical thinking, has been done at NCTM conferences, the Park City Mathematics Institute, and at some universities. The best PD we have experienced in the United States has been built on some of these principles, and we advocate for more teachers having high-quality experiences that incorporate these and other foundational principles.",,
