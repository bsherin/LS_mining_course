"Christine C. Benson and Cheryl G. Malm iIf you approach people on almost any  street in America and ask them to state a formula that they remember from high school math, most will say either y = mx + b or a2 + b 2 = c 2. Although one of these formulas may come to mind, they may not remember why it is used.",4,mtms2011-02-336a,,
"cite y = mx + b or a2 + b 2 = c 2 almost automatically. This situation occurs because students have not made a connection between the concepts and their associated formulas. If so, they would see that several of these formulas just use different letters (variables) to represent the same relationships.",5,mtms2011-02-336a,,
"Middle-level students are capable of exploring the connections among these concepts; they are neither “too young” nor “not ready” to learn these ideas (NMAP 2008). It is also essential for both middle school and high school teachers to “recognize and understand the mathematical concepts being developed, not just to teach the abstract manipulation but also to orchestrate the conversation” that builds ",6,mtms2011-02-336a,,

"A random irregular shape the connections among mathematical topics (NCTM 2000, p. 277). Middle school mathematics  generally explores applications of the Pythagorean theorem and lays the foundation for working with linear equations. The Grade 8 Curriculum Focal Points recommend that students “apply the Pythagorean theorem to fi nd distances between points in the Cartesian coordinate plane to measure lengths and analyze polygons and  polyhedra” (NCTM 2006, p. 20).",23,mtms2011-02-336a,,
" Although developing a generalized equation for a circle is commonly considered a high school topic, initial explorations tied to the Pythagorean theorem are within the grasp of middle-grades students and lay the foundation for further work at the high school level.

Case 1: An Equation for a Line y = mx + b,25,mtms2011-02-336a,,
"Preservice teachers are given this problem:  If you make an x/y table for all ordered pairs that made the equation y = 2x + 3 true, and then graph each ordered pair, what would the graph look like? ",26,mtms2011-02-336a,,
"When preservice teachers see this prob- lem, many make an x/y table, plot two or three points, and draw a line through the points. When told that they are allowed to use this method only if they can explain why this method works (i.e., why they are allowed to just graph a few points and then draw the whole line), they generally say, “That is what my teacher told me to do, and it works.” When asked to explain the mathematics behind this method, it is rare to hear that the line is the set of points whose ordered pairs satisfy the equation or make the equation true. ",27,mtms2011-02-336a,,
"To elicit understanding, we have them start over on a new graph and begin writing ordered pairs and graphing points. After calculating and plotting twenty to thirty ordered pairs— including decimals and fractions—they see that a line is formed from the set of points created by graphing all the ordered pairs that make the equation true. The next step is to ask if the point (234, 2754) will be on this line. A few students groan because they think they need to get a larger piece of graph paper to answer this question. However, some students realize that they simply need to put the x- and y-values of the ordered pair in the equation at the same time and see if they get a true statement. If the statement is true, the point is on the line. Otherwise, the point is not on the line. Once students understand this, only then do we talk about the fact that it takes two points to determine a line, so graphing only two points—we require a third point as a check—is enough to determine where all the solutions to the equation are located. It also explains why, then, it is okay to graph two points and connect them with a line. ",28,mtms2011-02-336a,,

"Coordinate geometry is used to explore further the properties of plane figures. For instance, after graphing four points, students use slope to identify perpendicular and/or parallel sides of a quadrilateral. They also use the distance formula to identify congruent sides to classify the figure as a rectangle, rhombus, square, kite, and so on. ",32,mtms2011-02-336a,,
"When we reach these investigations, the groans accompanying the perceived need to “memorize” new formulas inevitably follow. While having a formula to use is often within the comfort zone of elementary preservice teachers, as opposed to reasoning their way through to a solution, memorizing formulas and applying them correctly is often an anxietyridden process. These students lack the conceptual understanding needed  to uncover the steps of a process described by a generalized formula. To help them visualize the processes and understand the steps taken to solve the problem, we derive the distance formula by connecting it to one of the few formulas most readily remembered, the Pythagorean theorem. First, however, we explore the concepts connected to the theorem.",33,mtms2011-02-336a,,
Case 2: The Pythagorean Theorem a2 + b2 = c2,34,mtms2011-02-336a,,
"Is a2 + b 2 = c 2 the only statement of the Pythagorean theorem, or is it simply one algebraic version of the relationship described? Watson (2007) and Ellis and Pagni (2008) offer interesting ways to teach and use the Pythagorean theorem in the middle grades. When working with our preservice teachers, we further develop this mathematical relationship by asking them to construct different similar figures on each side of right triangles. In so doing, they can fully understand that the Pythagorean theorem indicates the relationship between the areas of these similar figures, not just lengths of the sides of a right triangle. For example, many, but not all, of our students have seen a diagram that  illustrates the relationship between the squares constructed on the sides of a right triangle—the actual geometric shapes, not just numeric representations (see fig. 1a). ",35,mtms2011-02-336a,,
We then ask students to create semicircles on each side of a right triangle and calculate the areas. They are always surprised to find that the area of the semicircle on the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the areas of the two smaller semicircles on the legs (see fig. 1b). ,36,mtms2011-02-336a,,
"With the help of dynamic geometry technology, this process can be repeated with several other shapes, including irregular ones (see fig. 1c). When students look at these geometric representations, the formula they  do not assume that merely stating the Pythagorean theorem implies that students understand its applications.",37,mtms2011-02-336a,,
"same. For example, if point A is located at 4, and if point B is located at 9, what is the distance between points A and B (see fi g. 2)?",38,mtms2011-02-336a,,
"Students say the distance is fi ve,  and someone usually asks, “Five what?” A discussion follows about the need to defi ne units of measure and what to say if the units of measure are not defi ned. At this level, however, students are soon comfortable describing the distance from point A to point B as fi ve units. When asked how they determined this, many are embarrassed to admit that they simply counted the units from four to nine. They assume that there must be a more complicated way to get the answer and obviously this would be the method we would expect to hear. ",39,mtms2011-02-336a,,
"When working with preservice  teachers, this situation leads to a discussion about whether some solution strategies should be more highly valued or more readily accepted than others. We also discuss the need to begin from where students are in their thinking processes when exploring problem situations. ",40,mtms2011-02-336a,,
"Eventually, we ask students how the distance between two points would be determined if counting was not easily  accomplished, say, between point A at 27 and point B at 417. Is an arithmetic operation available that can be used to determine the distance between these two points? Students return to simpler examples, such as those in fi gure 2, and soon agree that they can subtract the coordinates to determine the distance between the two points. These questions are used to follow up: “Does it matter which endpoint you subtract from?” “What if one or both of the coordinates are negative?” ",41,mtms2011-02-336a,,
"After a quick review of what it  means to subtract a negative number, students are sure this procedure will work, whether the coordinates are both positive, both negative, or one of each. We agree that actual distances must always be positive or zero. (We usually choose to discuss later on the fact that negative distance is an indication of direction.) Reviewing, or introducing, absolute value notation allows students to write expressions describing the distance between the two points.",42,mtms2011-02-336a,,
"Next, we look at the distance  between two points on a coordinate plane. We begin by selecting two points on a horizontal line, labeling the ordered pairs, and asking students to compute the distance between these two points (see fi g. 3a). ",43,mtms2011-02-336a,,
"Students begin to understand that the distance between points A and B on the coordinate plane is conceptually the same as the length of the segment on the number line. They are then able to transfer the previous work to a horizontal line on the Cartesian plane. Although they may revert to “counting” the units, after further discussion they concede that subtraction could be used to compute the distance between these two points. One need only subtract the x-components, since the y-components are the same. Moving to points on a vertical segment, students conclude that subtraction also works, although now you must subtract the y-components (see fi g. 3b). In  thought they knew so well takes on a new meaning. ",44,mtms2011-02-336a,,
The Pythagorean theorem actually  expresses the relationship between the areas of similar shapes built on the sides of any given right triangle. The fact that the generally used form of the theorem is the one associated with the areas of the squares built on the sides of the right triangle is easily explained by examining what is involved in computing the area of the fi gures constructed. ,45,mtms2011-02-336a,,

When asked to determine the distance from point A to point B, such as in fi gure 3c, students are tempted to try to remember a procedure from a middle school or high school class or page through their textbook looking for a formula they are certain is there. We acknowledge that a formula does exist but also ask, “Do you really want to memorize a new formula or simply use information you already know?” Getting an affi rmative response to the latter, we hand out graph paper, rulers, and colored pencils, and students graph and connect the points, as we have done previously.",50,mtms2011-02-336a,,

"To begin developing the relationship, students draw a red horizontal line through point A (see fi g. 4a). To orient them to the coordinate plane and check their understanding of ordered pairs, they label the coordinates of the point at which this red line intersects the y-axis. Students then draw a blue vertical line through point B and label the coordinates of the intersection of the blue line with the x-axis. The next step is to identify the coordinates of the intersection of the red and blue lines and label this point C.",63,mtms2011-02-336a,,
"Since the distance from point A to point B seems to be more diffi cult to determine, we begin by looking at other distances that can readily be  determined. We use subtraction to determine that the horizontal distance from point A to point C is 3 units and the vertical distance from point B to point C is 4 units. To make the connection to prior knowledge, students are asked what type of a fi gure they have constructed, and they answer, “It is a right triangle.” Most students recognize that the Pythagorean theorem, or a2 + b2 = c2, now applies. With this information, they determine that the distance between point A and point B is fi ve units.",64,mtms2011-02-336a,,

Case 4: An Equation for a Circle (x − h)2 + (y − k)2 = r 2,67,mtms2011-02-336a,,
"Case 4 brings the discussion of cases 1–3 full circle. As mentioned earlier, understanding the connection among the numeric, graphic, and symbolic representations of a relationship is foundational for understanding the graphs of linear and nonlinear equations. Beigie  (2008) gives a very nice example of the Circle Discovery problem he uses with his seventh-grade prealgebra students in which students create a graph of the equation x2 + y2 = 52 by plotting points, similar to the method described in case 1 for a linear equation. Without understanding that graphs are the pictorial representations of all the solutions for the equation, students may (and often do) graph two ordered pairs that make the equation true. They connect them with a straight line and think they are fi nished, because they correctly performed the process learned for graphing an equation. Graphing multiple solutions to the equation illustrates the nonlinear nature of this graph.",68,mtms2011-02-336a,,
"Beigie’s example resulted in a circle  with the center at the origin, which is a perfectly appropriate starting place for middle-grades students. To build on this understanding, we look at a defi nition of a circle, work some concrete examples, and then generalize the process as was done for the distance formula.",69,mtms2011-02-336a,,
"A circle is the set of all points that  are equidistant from a fi xed point. The fi xed point is called the center, for example, the point (h, k); the fi xed distance is the radius, r. The defi nition is important for several reasons:  1.  It helps students understand that a circle is just the “edge,” it does not include the interior of the circle. 2.  It helps them understand that the  graph is a set of points, just as it was when they were graphing a line.",70,mtms2011-02-336a,,

Then the distance between the points (x, y) and (2, 5) is 6. Using the process to determine the distance between two points results in the following equation: (x − 2)2 + (y − 5)2 = 62, where (2, 5) is the center of the circle, and 6 is the radius (see fi g. 5a).",77,mtms2011-02-336a,,

If we know the center, (1, 4) for example, and a given point on the circle, say, (−2, 9), the generalized equation can be applied to determine the length of the radius. We can still use (x, y) to represent any point on the circle. Then the distance between each point (x, y) and (1, 4) is the same as the distance between (−2, 9) and (1, 4), because both distances are the constant radius of the same circle (see fi g. 6).",81,mtms2011-02-336a,,

"Do you have a junk drawer at home, a place where you throw items you might need some day? Students often treat some of the mathematical facts they learn in this way; they are unrelated bits of information that are tossed in a mental junk drawer. Educators, on the other hand, see these pieces of information as parts of a growing structure. They understand that an idea may be represented  in several different ways, that several different formulas may represent the same relationship, or that they can be used for the same purpose. Teachers’ knowledge is organized around, and connected to, the foundational ideas of their discipline; this organization allows them to use their knowledge to solve a variety of problems (NRC 2005). “To understand something as a specifi c instance of a more general case—which is what understanding a more fundamental structure means— is to have learned not only a specifi c thing but also a model for understanding other things like it that one may encounter” (Bruner 1960).
