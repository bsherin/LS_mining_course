Learning 24/7: Changing Attitudes about Mathematics,2,mtms2008-09-108a,,
"We introduced a mathematics workshop for teachers by asking participants to give a simile for mathematics: “Math is like a _______.” The responses provided insight into the perceptions of the people we would be working with over the next three days.  •  “Math is like a skyscraper, because  it can take you to great heights.” someone along the way, maybe a parent (and it is hoped not a teacher), had modeled a discomfort with mathematics that she adopted as her own.  attitudes about MatheMatics in  the united states",3,mtms2008-09-108a,,
"Unfortunately, negative attitudes about mathematics are fairly prevalent in American society. The comment “I’m not good at math” is heard in parentteacher conferences, in the guidance counselor’s office, at the dinner table, at the income tax office, and at the checkout counter—just about anywhere that people need to use mathematics. Although the causes for poor attitudes about mathematics remain somewhat elusive, it is “a topic which has long been associated with a poor attitude among students as well as in the general population” (Sherman and Christian 1999, p. 4).",4,mtms2008-09-108a,,
"If mathematics achievement is to improve, a change in attitudes is necessary. Can educators convince students and parents that mathematics is not only necessary in their everyday lives but also fun? One community  •  “Math is like a set of Lincoln logs. You have to build a good foundation so everything doesn’t come tumbling down.” •  “Math is like a hula hoop because  once you learn some basics, they just keep coming ’round and ’round.”",5,mtms2008-09-108a,,
"The similes kept coming; they were  both creative and positive. Teachers used different similes to illustrate how mathematics builds over time, how it can lead to success in life, and how it is enjoyable. Then it happened.  “Math is like a lollipop. It sucks.”",6,mtms2008-09-108a,,
"Everyone laughed, albeit somewhat uncomfortably. This teacher explained that she loves teaching reading but was “never good at math.” Had we probed, we most likely would have learned that  elaine shannon-smith, eshannon@ neo.rr.com, lives in Fairlawn, Ohio. gay Fawcett, gayfawcett@yahoo.com, lives in Palm Bay, Florida.",7,mtms2008-09-108a,,

The goal is to embed fun middle school mathematics into family outings in their community. ",8,mtms2008-09-108a,,
"The project, titled “Learning 24/7: Community as Classroom,” is a partnership among schools, parents, and community organizations. “Learning 24/7” is coordinated by the Summit Education Initiative (SEI), a nonprofit organization formed in 1996 by the business community in Summit County, in the greater Akron, Ohio, area.

"The mathematics fun begins when local teachers and administrators meet with representatives from community organizations such as the zoo, the park, a minor league baseball park, a playhouse theater, and others. The representatives discuss upcoming or current programs that would allow the organization to support the middle school mathematics curriculum. Then an educator with a knack for incorporating mathematics into real-life scenarios designs the activities. This designer works with a representative from the community organization, typically the education director, and SEI staff to determine which ideas will add educational value to the community site. After the designer turns the best ideas into activities, a local artist illustrates the activity card or guide. The critical final step is piloting the activity with students and parents. Teachers who work on the activities recruit families to visit the sites and try out the activities. SEI staff often attends and unobtrusively observes families. Parents and their children then fill out a form indicating whether the activity was enjoyable and mathematically engaging. Based on their feedback, it is either back to the drawing board or on to publication.",10,mtms2008-09-108a,,
"1. At the Akron Zoo, families encounter TNT, the resident Komodo dragon. When they stop to eat in the zoo’s new café, families receive a tray liner with an activity exploring the time it will take TNT to capture a meal of its own. A colorful picture accompanies the information, including the time in seconds and the distance in feet that TNT and its prey are traveling. Over a sandwich, families can calculate how many feet TNT has to run before it has a tasty dinner. ",11,mtms2008-09-108a,,
"Activity 2 addresses this Ohio Mathematics Benchmark: Write and solve real-world, multistep problems involving money and elapsed time and temperature, and verify reasonableness of solutions.  2. While watching a game at the minor league baseball park, students can revisit the concept of elapsed time by charting the beginning times and ending times for three innings. The activity card then suggests that students use the process at home to figure out how much time is spent watching the content of a halfhour television show versus the time spent watching the commercials in that same half hour. ",12,mtms2008-09-108a,,
"Activity 3 is based on this Ohio Measurement Standard: Students estimate and measure to a required degree of accuracy and precision by selecting and using appropriate units, tools, and technologies.  3. At the Cuyahoga Valley National Park, students can put on pedometers and measure their walking strides to calculate the distance they hike on the trails and climb on rocks and ledges.  saMple activities Activity 1 is based on this Ohio Mathematics Benchmark: Approximate and interpret rates of change from graphical and numerical data.",13,mtms2008-09-108a,,

"When asked what they think about the activities, students responded with positive attitudes about mathematics. “The pictures were cute and engag- ing, making you want to take on the challenge.” “I like it because of the weird but true facts about the animals.” “I enjoyed it. My friends should come next time.”",15,mtms2008-09-108a,,
"Parents’ comments also expressed  affirmative attitudes. “I liked this because it’s something we could do together.” “We weren’t actively looking for an educational experience like this, but it was nice to stumble on it!” “This made the trip to the zoo a little more special.”",16,mtms2008-09-108a,,
"You, too, can Work to change MatheMatics attitudes Examine your own community partnerships and projects. What organizations are available in your neighborhoods? What about PTA groups, local business partnerships, churches, or any group of individuals who could join forces to make it happen? Where do families go? Could you design an activity for the little league ball fields, the ice cream shop, or the public library? Could you involve the art teacher and his or her students in designing brochures or activity cards? We realize that the issue of poor attitudes about mathematics is so complex that it cannot be easily changed. However, if  you can work with a few others to jump-start such an initiative, you can help your community take steps in the right direction.
