"This department shares creative solutions to the problems in “Solve It!” that appears a few times a year in MTMS. Send student work, along with sufficient information, so that readers can follow their thinking. Send manuscripts to edward s. Mooney, Illinois State University, Campus Box 4520, Normal, IL 61790-4520, or by e-mail to mooney@ilstu.edu. Published solutions will be credited. ",4,mtms2010-08-11a,,
"Many of you are familiar with Sudoku puzzles. For this  variation, place the integers 1 through 9 into each row  below such that the following are true: •  The product of each set of three numbers is given at   the end of the row or column.",5,mtms2010-08-11a,,
• Each digit appears exactly once in each row.,6,mtms2010-08-11a,,
• Each digit appears exactly once in each column.,7,mtms2010-08-11a,,
• Each digit appears exactly once in each 3 × 3 grid.,8,mtms2010-08-11a,,
Some products are provided below. The numbers on the  bottom are the products of the three numbers in that column. The numbers on the left represent the products of the first  three numbers in each row. The numbers on the right are the products of the last three numbers in each row. (The product of the middle three numbers in each row is not given.) 14   72   360   96 315 12 27 40 336 48 216 35 56 27 240,9,mtms2010-08-11a,,
"Fig. 1 Vanessa’s solution, obtained by guess and check, represents the process that many students used to solve this number puzzle.",10,mtms2010-08-11a,,
"Francisco Sala García, presented a solution that is representative of those received (see fig. 1). Most students described a general process of guessing and checking to complete the task. However, some students included some specific strategies for solving the task.",11,mtms2010-08-11a,,
Students’ success at solving these number puzzles shows that they were thinking outside the box. ,12,mtms2010-08-11a,,

"Alex: “When I found a number ending in 0 or 5, I tried a 5 on that row. Then I divided that number by 5 to find if the factors of that answer would work on that row.” ",15,mtms2010-08-11a,,
"Rachael: “If a product had only 3 factors, I knew that those factors did not  go in any other row or column.”",16,mtms2010-08-11a,,
Allison: “I first found where the factors of 5 and 7 went. Then I could eliminate possibilities for the other squares.”,17,mtms2010-08-11a,,
Fig. 3 This sample product-ku will give students more practice. Two sets of solutions are appended online as figure 4.  60 108 56 24 56 270 12 135 224 144 20 126 60 16 378 192 54 35 20 126 144 48 189 40 14 160 162 36 112 90 280 216 84 96 45,18,mtms2010-08-11a,,
"Abhilasha, a student at Horace Mann Middle School, describes his process:",19,mtms2010-08-11a,,
"The strategy I used for this was figuring out the boxes row by row. I would find 3 possible #’s to be the number. After figuring out the possible numbers for each row I would move on to the columns to see what 3 numbers from each row make the product given. By doing this, I determined the exact placement of each number.",20,mtms2010-08-11a,,
"Alex, a student at Grandville ",21,mtms2010-08-11a,,
"Middle School, focused on finding where factors of 5 went into the grid by looking for numbers that end in 0 or 5. Rachael, a Harrisburg Academy student, focused on numbers that had only three factors to eliminate some possibilities. Allison, a student at Illinois State University, found that beginning the process by finding the factors of 5 and 7 made the task easier to complete (see fig. 2). These specific strategies were all useful in solving the task.",22,mtms2010-08-11a,,
Teachers may find it beneficial to  discuss such ideas in general terms: •	 Will	these	strategies	always	work	 for solving a product-ku task?  •	 Why	are	they	useful?	 •	 Are	there	other	specific	strategies	 that may or may not work? ,23,mtms2010-08-11a,,
"Some students, for example, stated that 9 would always go with the large  or largest products and that 1 would be the factor of the small or smallest products. Although this thought process may work for this puzzle, it is worth discussing as to whether such strategies will always work. Allowing students to make conjectures and discuss the generalization of the strategies can help them when reasoning about mathematics.",24,mtms2010-08-11a,,
"If you have the solution to any Sudoku puzzle, you can create a productku task by providing the corresponding products. Figure 3 shows such an example. You will find that more than one solution can be found for the product-ku puzzle, even though the Sudoku has only one. ",25,mtms2010-08-11a,,
Appended to the online version of this article are two solutions to figure 3’s puzzle and a blank grid to help you create your own product-ku puzzles. It is hoped that you find the task and the corresponding discussions enriching.,26,mtms2010-08-11a,,
