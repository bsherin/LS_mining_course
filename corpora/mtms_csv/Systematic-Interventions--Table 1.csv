5,Systematic Interventions for Teaching Ratios,"Mathematics interventions for struggling students supplement regular instruction and are frequently implemented through computer programs and activity sheet practice (Swanson et al. 2012). However, students with foundational misunderstandings do not benefi t from additional drill and practice alone. Instead, interventions that balance concepts with procedures help build on students’ strengths and prior knowledge. To provide this type of instruction, teachers should know how to pinpoint the essence of the  ing; diagnose students’ thinking to determine strengths, weaknesses, and misconceptions; and design instruction that builds from that information. Emphasizing movement among concrete, semiconcrete, and abstract (CSA) representations is one instructional strategy that helps students build conceptual understanding (Sousa 2007).

11,Systematic Interventions for Teaching Ratios,"Diagnose According to Gersten and NewmanGonchar (2011), assessments used to identify students who are likely at risk of not achieving are called universal screeners. However, this screening does not always provide detailed information about specifi c misunderstandings. Sometimes it is necessary to administer in-depth diagnostic assessments to pinpoint students’ strengths and weaknesses. ",11,Systematic Interventions for Teaching Ratios
12,Systematic Interventions for Teaching Ratios,"Performance-based assessment  tasks are designed to capture student thinking and are an informative assessment tool. Effective tasks permit students to demonstrate knowledge, skills, or understanding (Smith and Stein 2011). Such diagnostics help teachers design interventions and serve as a progress monitor to gauge the intervention’s effects. Any openended task requiring student explanation or connections can be an effective diagnostic tool. ",12,Systematic Interventions for Teaching Ratios
13,Systematic Interventions for Teaching Ratios,Instruct Using CSA,13,Systematic Interventions for Teaching Ratios
14,Systematic Interventions for Teaching Ratios,"Students often fi nd ratio reasoning diffi cult for the following reasons: Ratios present the need to coordinate two units, ratios can be reinterpreted as fractions, and ratios can be reinterpreted as quotients (Lobato and Ellis 2010). Using the CSA model can help develop students’ ability to reason about ratios because it systematically moves them through overlapping and sometimes simultaneous representations to build ﬂ uency and conceptual understanding (Sousa 2007). CSA instruction usually begins with the concrete phase in which students use manipulatives or physically act out a problem. Next, students use semiconcrete representations by drawing pictures or using diagrams. Finally, at the abstract phase, students use mathematical symbols to compute solutions. The goal of CSA is to help students connect representations and deepen conceptual understanding. The next section illustrates this framework.",14,Systematic Interventions for Teaching Ratios

17,Systematic Interventions for Teaching Ratios,"Ratios are “multiplicative comparisons or the joining of two quantities in a composed unit” (Lobato and Ellis 2010, p. 18). When considering the essence of the knowledge needed, students must understand how ratios are encountered in real life, such as calculating monetary exchange rates, comparing the amounts of ingredients in recipes, or computing miles per hour when driving. Additionally,  ratios are used in various contexts including units, map scales, geometry (e.g., pi), probability, and graphing (Hoffer 1988). One challenging aspect is the concept that ratios are distinct entities (such as miles per hour), which describe a comparison of two measurement quantities (miles compared with hours). ",17,Systematic Interventions for Teaching Ratios
18,Systematic Interventions for Teaching Ratios,"If universal screening assessments  reveal that students have diffi culty with ratio reasoning, they may have trouble interpreting problem contexts and discerning appropriate units of measure. This example presents a diagnostic task emphasizing the relationship between units rather than individual values associated with each unit: ",18,Systematic Interventions for Teaching Ratios
19,Systematic Interventions for Teaching Ratios,Sarah’s orange juice is made with a ratio of 1 cup of orange mix for every 3 cups of water. Jaylen’s orange juice is made with 3 cups of orange mix for every 5 cups of water. Whose orange juice has a stronger orange taste? ,19,Systematic Interventions for Teaching Ratios
20,Systematic Interventions for Teaching Ratios,"Students must coordinate two units, orange concentrate and water, and preserve the multiplicative relationship. For example, one student stated, “Jaylen’s [is stronger] because Sarah only put 1 cup of orange mix, Jaylen put 3; 3 is more than 1,” not considering the amount of orange concentrate compared with water. Instead, he only compared the amount of orange concentrate in each drink as an absolute quantity rather than relative quantity. This student needs practice modeling ratio relationships, coordinating  between two units, and moving from additive relationships to multiplicative relationships. Instruction should focus on the difference between comparisons where units are being compared in magnitude and a more sophisticated interpretation (multiplicative) where units are considered in terms of how many times larger is one unit compared with the other (Ellis 2013). ",20,Systematic Interventions for Teaching Ratios
21,Systematic Interventions for Teaching Ratios,The CSA strategy supports students as they model real-life contexts when using concrete manipulatives to show the relationship between quantities. See this example:   The results of the election showed that candidate A received 5 votes for every 2 votes that candidate B received. ,21,Systematic Interventions for Teaching Ratios

25,Systematic Interventions for Teaching Ratios,"Asking questions that focus on multiplicative comparisons, rather than “How many more votes did candidate A receive than candidate B?” or “Which candidate received more votes?” shifts the focus away from additive comparisons and toward students determining the unknown unit and the relationship between units.

27,Systematic Interventions for Teaching Ratios,Students can interpret contexts similar to those given at the concrete phase using diagrams or pictures to demonstrate the ratio relationship.,27,Systematic Interventions for Teaching Ratios
28,Systematic Interventions for Teaching Ratios,"Throughout the concrete  and semiconcrete phases, students need help connecting their concrete and semiconcrete models to abstract symbols using ratio language as a bridge. Having students use such phrases as 5 votes for every 2 votes or 10 votes for every 4 votes emphasizes the coordination of units (NRC 2001). It also helps develop multiplicative relationships because students realize that one can create new values with the same relationship. Students can then shorten that phrase to 5 for 2, then 5:2, or 5/2.",28,Systematic Interventions for Teaching Ratios
29,Systematic Interventions for Teaching Ratios,"Ratios as Fractions Ratios and fractions are linked but not identical. A number of mathematical connections link ratios and fractions: Ratios are often expressed in fraction notation, although ratios and fractions do not have identical meaning; ratios are often used to make “part-part” comparisons, but fractions are not (Lobato and Ellis 2010, p. 26). Although a fraction represents a part-whole relationship, a ratio can represent a part-whole, part-part, or whole-part relationship. For example, the ratio of 13 girls in a  class of 25 students can be written in a part-whole ratio as 13/15, 13:25, or  13 to 25. However, when comparing the number of girls to boys, the ratio can be written as 13/12, 13:12, or  13 to 12. The confusion associated with ratios written as fractions exists because students are often taught to only make part-whole comparisons using fractions (Lamon 2012). This oversimplified understanding causes students to be challenged when moving back and forth between partwhole relationships (fractions) and part-part or whole-part relationships.

31,Systematic Interventions for Teaching Ratios,"Fig. 1 One student illustrated her solution to the voting question.  color blocks representing different units (in this case, pets) can create various ratios for given situations. This same sequence can be modeled at the semiconcrete phase of instruction with pictures, such as with bar diagrams (see fi g. 3).",31,Systematic Interventions for Teaching Ratios
32,Systematic Interventions for Teaching Ratios,"When students use concrete and semiconcrete models, they should be encouraged to write abstract representations for each ratio relationship and then asked to identify differences in how the digits are positioned. If students have diffi culty determining the correct symbolic notation, they can be given a choice of three different notations and asked to select the correct one. For example, when comparing puppies to kittens (part-part comparison), students can be given the following three choices: 6:4, 4:6, and 4:10. When the part-whole relationship is explored explicitly, discuss how the whole is determined when two (or more) parts are given. Eventually, students write the abstract representation without the use of concrete or semiconcrete models (see fi g. 4). Next, discuss which of these ratios can (and cannot) be reinterpreted as fractions and which represent part-part relationships.",32,Systematic Interventions for Teaching Ratios
33,Systematic Interventions for Teaching Ratios,"Ratios as Quotients “Ratios can be meaningfully reinterpreted as quotients” (Lobato and Ellis 2010, p. 31). Just as ratios can be reinterpreted as fractions, it also makes sense to reinterpret ratios as quotients. Students need this ﬂ exibility so that they can use ratios effi ciently in different ways with different types  b.  each of the different pairs  of pets; and c.  the total number of pets  to each pet. ",33,Systematic Interventions for Teaching Ratios
34,Systematic Interventions for Teaching Ratios,"Students must generate a schema for interpreting different ratio relationships (part-whole, part-part, and whole-part). This work builds on their understanding of part-whole ratios and moves to less familiar relationships like part-part and whole-part. Helping students see beyond ratios as merely being part-whole comparisons will help them build ﬂ exibility with ratios. They can also discuss differences and similarities between fractions and ratios. Concrete manipulatives can be used to show connections among units; for example, differing ",34,Systematic Interventions for Teaching Ratios

38,Systematic Interventions for Teaching Ratios,(a) (b) students’ ﬂ exibility with fraction notation for ratios is the following Pet Store problem: ,38,Systematic Interventions for Teaching Ratios
39,Systematic Interventions for Teaching Ratios,"A pet store has 4 dogs, 3 cats, 1 snake, and 6 hamsters. Use the quantities of each pet to label the ratios 1/14, 4/3, 3/6, and 14/16 with the appropriate units. ",39,Systematic Interventions for Teaching Ratios
40,Systematic Interventions for Teaching Ratios,"By asking students to label each ratio, teachers are testing students’ precision with labeling units as well as their understanding of corresponding order.  They are also gaining important assessment information. For example, one student identifi ed the correct units for the ratio 1:14 but reversed the unit order (see fi g. 2a). Another student rewrote the ratio for dogs to cats as cats to dogs, stating that one could not have a fraction with “the bigger number on top” (see fi g. 2b).   Context and units of measure play an important role in helping students understand how fractions and ratios are related. Consider a similar scenario: ",40,Systematic Interventions for Teaching Ratios
41,Systematic Interventions for Teaching Ratios,"There are 4 puppies, 6 kittens, 1 snake, and 3 guinea pigs at the pet store. Write a ratio for— a.  each pet to the total number  of pets;  of problems. For example, if a person earns $10 for two hours, $20 for four hours, $30 for six hours, and $40 for eight hours of work, the ratio 10:2 can be reinterpreted as the quotient 10 ÷ 2. The following item can be used to diagnose students’ ability to use ratios reinterpreted as quotients:  A cell phone service provider offers 200 minutes for $10. How much do they charge per minute? ",41,Systematic Interventions for Teaching Ratios
42,Systematic Interventions for Teaching Ratios,Some students may use equivalent ratios such as 10 200 100 20 to determine the cost per minute. These students may not have internalized the multiplicative comparison represented between the number of minutes and dollars and should be guided toward a more efficient way to determine the solution. ,42,Systematic Interventions for Teaching Ratios
43,Systematic Interventions for Teaching Ratios,"Students taught to solve this problem using a proportion sometimes have difficulty executing the procedure correctly. In figure 5, a student used cross products to solve for the unit rate but mistakenly divided 200 by $10, finding a rate of minutes per dollar rather than dollars per minute. Using cross products led to an error and was less efficient because the  rate of dollars per minute could be found by simply dividing $10 by  200 minutes. Errors like this could indicate that the student does not have a solid conceptual understanding and is overgeneralizing a poorly understood procedure. Interventions for this student should include helping him or her develop an understanding of unit rate and connecting it to division.",43,Systematic Interventions for Teaching Ratios
44,Systematic Interventions for Teaching Ratios,"When helping students understand ratios reinterpreted as quotients, the CSA approach supports students’ sense making of the operation used to determine unit rate  (division). Consider this problem:   Tevin bought 5 DVDs for $20. How much will 20 DVDs cost?",44,Systematic Interventions for Teaching Ratios
45,Systematic Interventions for Teaching Ratios,"Because students may be challenged by this two-step problem, reveal the hidden question by asking, “How much did Tevin pay for each DVD?” Students who struggle can first focus on the unit rate, then build up to the full problem. Students can use blocks to represent the DVDs and play money (single dollars) to represent $20. When presented with physical materials, students instinctively use a fair share and partitive division approach to show the cost of each DVD. Asking students, “What operation could determine the cost of one DVD?” will also help connect unit cost to division.",45,Systematic Interventions for Teaching Ratios
46,Systematic Interventions for Teaching Ratios,"If students use manipulatives and  are able to grasp that this problem involves division, the same context  could be used with semiconcrete representations and a drawing to solve the problem. Most students will draw a model that matches what they did with concrete materials (see fig. 6).",46,Systematic Interventions for Teaching Ratios
47,Systematic Interventions for Teaching Ratios,"When asked how she solved this problem, one student said, “I drew  5 DVDs and 20 dollar bills just like  I did with the blocks, then gave  $1 bills to each DVD until they  were gone. Each DVD costs $4.”  The teacher asked, “When you gave  $1 bills to each DVD, what operation was involved?” thus explicitly connecting to the operation of division. This question helped the student identify that she was dividing $20 into five groups while showing the related symbolic notation to calculate the unit rate.",47,Systematic Interventions for Teaching Ratios

This use of various strategies will help them see regularity in their reasoning and derive a generalizable method (see fig. 7).

53,Systematic Interventions for Teaching Ratios,"For the abstract phase, students  can be given similar contexts to those used previously. However, the expectation is that students will be able to show the symbolic computation. See, for example, this problem:   A tray of 8 brownies has  1600 calories. How many  calories are in 12 brownies?",53,Systematic Interventions for Teaching Ratios
54,Systematic Interventions for Teaching Ratios,"Students must identify this problem as a multiplicative comparison of two quantities, the number of brownies and the number of calories. By eating one brownie, they are eating 1/8 of 1600 calories and then building up to the number of calories in 12 brownies. When students solve problems using only abstract representations, they  should be able to show their reasoning. Notice that the strategy in figure 8 for determining the total number of calories demonstrates naïve understandings because this student used repeated addition first, only using multiplication to verify her answer.
