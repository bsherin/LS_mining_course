Specializing: An Entry Point for Problem Solving,1,mtms2011-11-199a,,

"Many students think of mathematics as a set of teacher-provided rules that have to be learned so that the appropriate rule can be applied correctly to problems on a test (Lampert 1990). However, mathematics is more than learning rules and following a list of steps. Problem solving and reasoning are at the heart of this discipline. Mathematical reasoning “often begins with exploration, generalizing, and convincing” (NCTM 2009, p. 4). In Mathematics and Plausible Reasoning, Pólya (1954) discusses previous discoveries and hypothesizes how they were found. ",3,mtms2011-11-199a,,
"The discovery of each new idea  relies heavily on a process called  specializing. In this process, patterns are illuminated. Stewart (2006) describes specializing as being one of the most important skills for a mathematician to develop. Mason, Burton, and Stacey (1985) describe mathematical reasoning as a helical process that begins with this process of specializing. When a problem solver specializes, he or she tries specific examples or cases to gain insight into what the answer ",4,mtms2011-11-199a,,

When enough specific examples have been examined, a problem solver may move to the next stage of generalizing: articulating a pattern observed while specializing (verbally, concretely, pictorially, or symbolically). This stage is repeated until the problem solver is convinced that a solution is reasonable. Specializing is an investigative process that serves as the entry point to a problem. Through it, one becomes more familiar with the question at hand.",5,mtms2011-11-199a,,
"Two task structures that support the specializing process follow. The first describes tasks that can be explored through examining specific examples. The second uses tasks that encourage pattern seeking. With either type of task, it is important that students share their thinking explicitly. When teachers ask students to discuss and share the ideas they develop as part of the specializing process, students should be encouraged to construct mathematical arguments (leading to conjecturing and generalizing) and engage in mathematical thinking.",6,mtms2011-11-199a,,
will develop a stronger sense of the numerical relationships implied in the problem and determine if the initial conjecture for the specific case generalizes to any case.,7,mtms2011-11-199a,,
"A third student predicted that  more cream would be in the coffee. When testing the first case, this student was surprised to find that this result was not what happened and suggested that one should “try a bigger spoon.” This third student then began testing multiple cases, varying the size of the cream container, coffee cup, and spoon. Two important points can be drawn from these three student  examples: 1.  Tasks such as the Coffee and ",8,mtms2011-11-199a,,
"Cream problem create opportunities for a teacher to engage the entire class in a discussion about how students tested specific cases. This undertaking supports the importance of generating specific cases as an entry point into making sense of a problem. If the teacher focuses class discussion around the reasoning that students engage in as part of their initial attempts to solve the problem, students become comfortable launching into a novel problem-solving situation.

"When students consider specific examples of a problem as part of the problem-solving process, they are engaging in a form of specializing. Investigating a problem by examining specific cases can help students make sense of the problem’s structure and can lead to a better understanding of it (Mason, Burton, and Stacey 1985). Assigning tasks that provide opportunities for discussion will allow students to reflect on their initial thinking while investigating a problem. When doing so, students will learn that it is important to consider more than one example and that an answer may not be readily apparent when they are initially presented with a problem.

"Consider the following Cream and Coffee problem, which involves qualitative proportional reasoning:  A spoonful of cream is taken from a pitcher of cream and put into a cup of coffee. The coffee is stirred. Then a spoonful of this mixture is put into the pitcher of cream. Is there now more cream in the coffee cup or more coffee in the pitcher of cream? (Stewart, Redlin, and Watson 2007 p. 66)",12,mtms2011-11-199a,,
"Students were asked to give their answer and provide a supporting argument. Since the problem did not list specific numerical quantities, the solution is not immediately obvious. Middle school students may interpret the task as comparing relative quantities rather than comparing absolute quantities, which is the generally accepted task. Many students then guess that there is more cream in the coffee. ",13,mtms2011-11-199a,,
"Students are often unsure how to approach this problem. For example, the student whose work is in figure 1 tried to model this scenario with an ",14,mtms2011-11-199a,,

Creating an equation does not have to necessarily be the first step in finding the solution. Investigating specific cases can be the entry point into this problem.",15,mtms2011-11-199a,,
"The student whose work is  displayed in figure 2 considered a specific case with 10 ounces of cream, 5 ounces of coffee, and one spoonful that held 1 ounce. By recording the different amounts of coffee and cream in each container after each transfer of mixture from one container to another, the student was able to conjecture that the amount (5/6 ounce) of cream in the coffee cup and coffee in the pitcher of cream was the same. This student was confident of the answer after examining only one particular specific example. This scenario gave the teacher an opportunity to suggest that the student test several cases to be sure this conclusion would hold across all cases. By testing several cases, the student  2.  Since novice problem solvers are often content to explore just one example, such discussions suggest to them that multiple cases need to be tested.",16,mtms2011-11-199a,,

"Pólya (1954) notes that the discovery of new mathematical ideas relies heavily on the process of specialization to illuminate a pattern. Burger and Starbird (2005) believe that observing and identifying patterns lead to new ideas. “We gain experience by looking repeatedly at clear and simple cases” (p. 638). Mason, Burton, and Stacey (1985) describe three forms of specialization—random, systematic, and artful—that each serve a specific purpose. ",18,mtms2011-11-199a,,
"Specializing may begin with random examples. The primary purpose of random specializing is to get a feel for the question. Once a solid understanding of the question has been gained, systematic specializing will detect relationships and patterns, which in turn will lay the groundwork for generalizing or conjecturing. Artful specializing examines key concepts underlying a generalization or a conjecture to increase its plausibility. When intelligently completed, specializing can lead to a generalization or a conjecture. When specialization is random, it may result in no progress toward a solution.",19,mtms2011-11-199a,,

"Systematic testing of values or her work, it would be important to highlight the importance of systematically testing values.",38,mtms2011-11-199a,,
"Figure 3b demonstrates specializing that is conducted systematically  by steadily decreasing the value of a without changing the value of b so that a better conjecture could be made. Through this more systematic, methodical manner of specializing, it  is more clearly evident that conditions under which a2 is greater than b2 were missed through random guessing. “Being systematic in specializing is often an important aid to generalizing because a pattern is more likely to be evident among related examples than with randomly chosen ones” (Mason, Burton, and Stacey 1985, p. 10).",39,mtms2011-11-199a,,
"Using an a < b task provides an opportunity to focus on how to structure work systematically and consider why being systematic is important. In fact, a teacher can further support developing the skill of systematic specializing by asking the student to consider the case that b is negative. This case will illuminate the key concept that the distance that a and b are from zero will determine which is larger, a2 or b2. ",40,mtms2011-11-199a,,
"Knowing when to be systematic is also an important aspect of mathematical reasoning. The use of systematic reasoning would benefit a problem solver working on the Coffee and Cream problem presented earlier. If students varied the amounts in the cream pitcher, coffee cup, and spoon by systematically adjusting the quantities, they could determine if they had tested the variety of possible relationships to be sure that their conjecture was mathematically founded.",41,mtms2011-11-199a,,
"The a < b task can be extended to consider other similar situations. Students who have already explored the relationship between a2 and b2 may first consider comparing a3 and b3. By systematically increasing the exponent, students can be pushed to look for a pattern and conjecture about how an and bn compare. Seeking patterns within a set of problems that are structurally similar can help students develop the capacity to look across cases and generalize about a group of problems. It is important when using such problems that the teacher highlight the role of systematic reasoning, because students by nature are not systematic thinkers. ",42,mtms2011-11-199a,,
The pattern-seeking behaviors that support breaking down and making sense of novel tasks need to be examined in classroom conversations to support students who are learning to specialize. ,43,mtms2011-11-199a,,

"NCTM (2009) points to the importance of learning to reason through problems and for this type of thinking to become a habit. However, mathematical reasoning needs to be developed in a purposeful way. Supporting the process of specializing thus offers an entry point to solving novel problems by supporting students’ capacity to look for patterns, then generalize and conjecture.",45,mtms2011-11-199a,,
"1.  Assign tasks that can be explored  through examining specific examples or cases. Problems that lack specific quantities, such as the Coffee and Cream problem, are ideal. Encourage students to explore the problem by inserting their own quantities and then to watch for patterns to emerge as they vary the quantities.  2.  Pose questions that encourage pattern seeking and that help students learn what they should be asking themselves: How many cases have I considered? Could I test specific values and see what is happening mathematically? Do the different solutions or cases I tried show a pattern? Have I tried a variety of numbers to see if the pattern holds for many cases? Are systematically ordered cases helpful?  3.  Once patterns have been detected,  ask students to make conjectures and draw generalizations about the patterns that emerge. Expect students to discuss the validity of their conjectures and generalizations with one another. This experience will allow them to ground their arguments in what they discovered  when they were trying to make sense of the problem. ",46,mtms2011-11-199a,,
"Students need repeated opportunities using multiple problems to develop the capacity to problem solve and reason mathematically. Paying careful attention to what one thinks about, or might want to think about, when trying to understand what a problem is asking needs to be developed. An explicit focus on making this reasoning visible in classroom conversations is critical if students are to develop the capacity to specialize.",47,mtms2011-11-199a,,
