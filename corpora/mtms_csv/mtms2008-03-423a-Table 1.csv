"Variables and  Spreadsheets Connect  with Real-World Problems  sSpreadsheet software is generally  available in schools and is in widespread use in business. The use of spreadsheets can help students make mathematical connections with problems in the world around them. Many real-life quantitative problems require algebra for decision making. Examples include the impact of rising gas prices on family budgets; the amount of gasoline left in the tank of a car and the distance to the nearest gas station; and the level of monthly income versus money needed to pay for food, rent, utilities, and clothing. Although these issues do not require complex mathematics, they do require knowledge of basic algebra involving variables and equations.  presentation displaying numerous pictures about Katrina’s widespread damage can set the stage for a demonstration of the impact of this event on people, in particular, children. A general statement of this problem frames the upcoming activities for students.",2,mtms2008-03-423a,,
Hurricane Katrina disrupted the lives of many children. Many people have donated toys. You are on a design team to create a playhouse that might be used by the children so that they can have a safe place to play with the toys. Investigate various designs for a playhouse by building a model.  activity 1:  design a Model Playhouse This activity introduces students to the use of a spreadsheet to help determine the costs of producing two types of playhouses.

This department is designed to provide activities appropriate for students in grades 5–9. The material may be reproduced by classroom teachers for use in their classes. Readers who have developed successful classroom activities are encouraged to submit manuscripts in a format similar to this “Mathematical Explorations.” Of particular interest are activities focusing on the Council’s Content and Process Standards and Curriculum Focal Points. Send submissions by accessing mtms.msubmit.net.  to explore the problem by entering different quantities and costs. The development of a spreadsheet shifts students’ thinking toward abstract representations for calculating the cost of each feature. Cells B5 and C5 can be described as the cells with the independent variables and D5 as the cell with the dependent variable in this problem. After completing this spreadsheet, students will find the Cape Cod model costs $2,503.00 and the Victorian model costs $5,596.00. Connections of specific cells in the spreadsheet with variables and covariates among the variables are key to students’ recognition of the important characteristics of creating spreadsheets. In the remainder of the activity, students will develop a proposal that reduces the cost of each model. Students need to consider how changes in the quantities for the items discussed in question 3 affect the changes in the models. What happens to its physical appearance? Of what value are the flower boxes? Multiple possibilities exist to meet the reduced costs for each model. In this way, the problem is extended beyond its original question of simply identifying the cost for each model to an open-ended question where students “analyze change in various contexts” (NCTM 2000, p. 222). The closing discussion highlights the concepts of dependent versus independent variables and covariates as well as ideas of the efficiency and usefulness of spreadsheets to explore changes and extend problems. Ask students directed questions such as these: What is the difference between dependent and independent variables? What does covariation mean when thinking about these different types of variables? How are spreadsheets designed to be useful in exploring the effect of independent variables to extend problems? Why is it important to use cell names rather than their values in spreadsheet formulas? different designs, students investigate the costs of the different features and their impact on the total costs using a preformatted spreadsheet (see the Teacher Preparation section for producing this spreadsheet). As students enter data, the spreadsheet calculates the total cost based on the unit costs for various features. Can students assume that the calculations are correct? How can the spreadsheet be tested? To explore these questions, students are likely to use quantities of 10 or 1 for each item to compare the spreadsheet subtotals with their mental estimates of the costs. ",6,mtms2008-03-423a,,
"The next challenge for students is to explore the formula-based instructions embedded in the spreadsheet to compute values. When they click on cell D6, for example, the status bar displays =B6*C6. They quickly realize that this formula is an instruction for the spreadsheet to compute the value that is visible in that cell of the spreadsheet. Teachers can help students understand the formula in cell D6 by directing their attention to the column and row markers in the spreadsheet. Students might explain, “Make D6 equal to the product of the value in B6 and the value in C6.” They also need to explain =SUM(D6:",7,mtms2008-03-423a,,
D11) as the formula that “sets the value displayed in D12 to be the sum of the values in D6 through D11.” ,8,mtms2008-03-423a,,
"Teachers can conclude this activity by asking students to consider the different playhouse designs that are created. Which model playhouse would  cost the most to produce? These explorations and discussions guide the students to connect the mathematical formulas with the spreadsheet operations for the creation of a dynamic spreadsheet.  activity 2: investigate  two Playhouse designs Students are ready to engage in a cost analysis of more realistic and complicated playhouse designs. The students will be considering two designs, the Cape Cod and the Victorian, found through a Web search. They can identify the features that are the most expensive (such as the adult Dutch door, the child Dutch door, and the flower boxes) and focus their attention on the impact of the costs for the various features. ",9,mtms2008-03-423a,,
"Students can work in pairs at  computer workstations to design a spreadsheet as described in activity sheet 2. For this spreadsheet to be useful, students need to enter the quantities and the formulas for the subtotal costs and the total costs for each model. Teachers should check that students enter the cell names (like B5) in the formula rather than specific numerical values to calculate the subtotal cost of the siding for the Cape Cod model. The formula for cell D5 should be =B5*C5. (Students also need to be reminded to start with an equal sign when entering a formula in a cell.) Entering numerical values does not support the development of a spreadsheet that allows students  activity 3:  PRoPosal foR constRuction",10,mtms2008-03-423a,,
"Students need experience working with and designing spreadsheets if they are to understand that this software is a useful mathematical tool. Activity sheet 3 extends the Katrina problem as students develop a proposal to meet a donor’s specifications, first discussed on activity sheet 2. The mathematics goal for this activity extends students’ experiences in constructing and using “mathematics models to represent and understand quantitative relationships” (NCTM 2000, p. 222). Students will use activity sheet 3 to extend a partially prepared spreadsheet model to design a proposal for the donor. (Follow the directions in the Teacher Preparation section, “Proposal for Construction Spreadsheet.”) Students enter appropriate formulas to find the total number of playhouses (H6–H10) and the total costs for each of the ideas (I6–I10). Then they explore various quantities for the Cape Cod and Victorian models to test the reliability and dependability of the formulas they entered, testing values that result in either “OK” or “Can’t do.” In the process, they are able to explore covariates among these variables as well as identify some quantities that they might eventually choose for their proposals. ",11,mtms2008-03-423a,,
"Although students might use a guess-and-check strategy to determine the quantities that will work, guide them in using algebraic equations to identify their beginning values. For the case of building 1/2 the number of Cape Cod playhouses as Victorian playhouses, the equation for the cost of the different types is this:  2290(C) + 4400(1/2)(C) = 500000",12,mtms2008-03-423a,,
"The solution to this equation indicates that the number for Cape Cod (C) playhouses is approximately 111 and the Victorian (1/2)C playhouses is 55. But with these two quantities, there is  money remaining. Could another house be built and still meet the donor’s challenge? With 56 for the Victorian, the model results in “Can’t do” because the cost overran the $500,000.00 amount available. Increasing the quantity for Cape Cod to 112 (with 55 Victorians) results in “OK,” whereas the entry of 113 results in “Can’t do.” The “Allowable?” helps students be efficient in their decision-making processes. ",13,mtms2008-03-423a,,
"After completing the proposals,  students are asked to highlight the row that they feel best meets the donor’s challenge. Using the values shown in  figure 1, most of the money is used when the number of Victorian houses is 1/4 the number of Cape Cod houses. This proposal serves nine fewer children, but the donor specifically requested that the selected option use the maximum amount of the donated money. ",14,mtms2008-03-423a,,
"Teachers can create different challenges for new proposals. For instance, teachers can ask students to create a proposal that builds between 140 and 150 Cape Cod houses, the most Victorian playhouses possible with the remaining dollars, and maximizes the amount needed from the $500,000.00. Although the nature of the questions in this activity changes to involve more of a decisionmaking element, the basic mathematical elements remain intact—exploring the covariation of variables. Again, in closing be sure to ask students questions such as these: If you were unable to design spreadsheets, what would you need to do to create a proposal for the donor in the Katrina  problem? What is the value of using a dynamic spreadsheet in modeling the Katrina problem? What mathematics did you learn in working on the Katrina problem? What did you learn about designing spreadsheets as you worked on the Katrina problem?  in conclusion",15,mtms2008-03-423a,,
"Principles and Standards for School Mathematics (NCTM 2000) advocates teaching important mathematics to all students using appropriate tools. NCTM’s vision specifically identifies technology as “an essential component of the [classroom] environment”  (p. 3). Principles and Standards further highlights the importance of algebra for all students, specifically indicating that students should be able to use “mathematical models to represent and understand quantitative relationships” (p. 222). Appropriate “computer technologies” support this emphasis in that they can be used to “perform operations on symbols and instantaneously do calculations on columns of data” while supporting students in learning “how to interpret technological representations and how to use the technology effectively and wisely”  (p. 37). Spreadsheet capabilities provide a dynamic and powerful tool for addressing these objectives. ",16,mtms2008-03-423a,,
"Although students can simply use spreadsheets designed by others, they learn much more about the mathematics embedded when they learn to design and create their own to explore mathematical problems. They have extended experiences with variables  fig. 1 Sample spreadsheet for the Proposal for Construction activity and modeling of quantitative relationships that are important in middlegrades mathematics education. They learn to construct the tools as a way of extending the problems with such questions as “What if I needed to reduce the cost of the playhouse mod- el?” Their efforts in learning to create spreadsheets need to be carefully integrated with ways that also support them in learning mathematics. Teachers need to look for and plan ways to scaffold this learning. They need to look for problems that focus students  fig. 2 Four designs for model playhouses 9"" 9"" 9"" 9"" 9"" 1/4"" wooden dowel, 4 inches long",17,mtms2008-03-423a,,
