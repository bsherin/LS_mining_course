Teaching Multiplication Algorithms from Other Cultures,0,mtms2007-12-298a,,
"Cheng-Yao Lin dDifferent multiplication algorithms  are known from different cultures. For example, the Hindus used a vertical and crosswise method; the Egyptians and Russian peasants used doubling; the Japanese used an abacus; and the Chinese used counting rods. These methods and techniques have been used to help people around the world in their daily lives, for example, in building houses, counting agricultural products, or conducting commercial transactions in the marketplace.  cheng-Yao lin, cylin@ siu.edu, is an assistant professor of mathematics education at Southern Illinois University, Carbon- dale, IL 62901.

"This article describes multiplication methods from the cultures of India, Egypt, Russia, Japan, and China, including how each method works and the value of each method, for use by in-service middle school teachers and their students. In-service teachers are often surprised to learn that many methods of multiplication are used around the world. Presenting these methods provides alternatives for students who struggle in learning the traditional algorithm. These methods also help students understand how other algorithms work and prompt them to think more deeply about numbers and operations. Finally, teachers agree that learning how people from different times and places used other algorithms to compute products is intriguing. In particular, Vedic multiplication can be appreciated as an efficient method for mental multiplication, and the Japanese approach helps students to see place value clearly. ",2,mtms2007-12-298a,,

Using Vedic multiplication to make mental calculations is extraordinarily efficient and simple (Becker 1986; Bharati Krishna Tirthaji 1991). For example, consider the procedure for multiplying 8 by 9, as shown in figure 1 and outlined below:  1.  Write 8 in column A, line 1, and 9  in column A, line 2.  2.  Because 8 is 2 away from 10, write 2 in column B, line 1. Because 9 is 1 away from 10, write 1 in column B, line 2.  3.  Multiply 2 × 1 to get 2. This result  gives the last digit of the answer.  4.

"egYptian Multiplication Ancient Egyptian multiplication was found in the Rhind papyrus, sometimes called the Ahmes papyrus, dating from 1650 BC. This document shows that the Egyptians developed algorithms for multiplication using doubling. For example, the procedure for multiplying 23 by 25 is shown in figure 4 and outlined in the following steps:  1.  Write 1 in column A and 25 in  column B.  2.  Double the value in each column until the number in column A is as close as possible to 23 but not greater than 23.

"Teachers understand how to carry out the Egyptian method of multiplication, but they may not understand at first why it works. After learning more about the mathematics behind the method, teachers see that it has the advantage of using only addition, subtraction, and multiplication by 2. Further, this method provides an opportunity to discuss the distributive property. For example, to multiply 23 by 25, 23 can be broken down into powers of 2, and the distributive property can be used to  23 × 25 = (1 × 24 + 0 × 23 + 1        × 22 + 1 × 21 + 1 × 20) × 25 = (16 + 0 + 4 + 2 + 1) × 25 = (16 × 25) + (4 × 25)       + (2 × 25) + (1 × 25) = 400 + 100 + 50 + 25 = 575",41,mtms2007-12-298a,,

Japanese Multiplication,81,mtms2007-12-298a,,
"The Japanese developed an algorithm for multiplication that was used on the abacus, or soroban. Circa 1600 AD, the Japanese adopted the Chinese abacus through contact with Korea. The Japanese abacus eliminated one bead from the upper deck and, later, another bead from the lower deck in each column of the Chinese abacus. The Japanese abacus has only one bead in the upper deck for a value of 5 and four beads in the lower deck with a value of 1 each. Numbers are formed by moving counters toward the bar. Numbers from 1 to 10 are shown in figure 7a. To set up a number such as 147, one bead in the upper deck is moved to the bar; four beads in the lower deck are moved to the bar; and one bead in the upper deck and two beads in the lower deck are moved to the bar (fig. 7b).
