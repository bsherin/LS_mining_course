"An important goal of school mathematics is to enable students to formulate, approach, and refine problems beyond those they have studied, allowing them to organize and consolidate their mathematical thinking (NCTM 2000; CCSSI 2010). To achieve this goal, students should be encouraged to develop expertise in a variety of areas, such as problem solving, reasoning and proof, communication, representation, and connections, as extolled in the NCTM Process Standards. In addition, teachers need to support their students’ development of adaptive reasoning, mathematical understanding, strategic competence, procedural fluency, and productive dispositions toward mathematics and  a context for developing Math expertise",13,mtms2013-02-348a,,
"Model eliciting activities (MEAs) are mathematical case studies that involve several variables.

"Dr. Louisa Rodriguez explained that the size of the crystals in the aluminum is often a good indicator of the relative resistance to denting or strength of the material. She said that aluminum consisting of smaller crystals was stronger than aluminum consisting of larger crystals. Dr. Rodriguez volunteered to provide microscopic photographs of the crystal size called micrographs,  because they were the standard way to compare the size of the crystals.  Materials engineers can chemically treat polished pieces of aluminum to make the boundaries between the crystals more visible. Using a camera attached to a microscope, a picture of the boundaries between the crystals can be obtained, and then the size of the crystals can be estimated.",25,mtms2013-02-348a,,
coach Meyers was fascinated and asked if it is ever possible to see metal  crystals without a microscope.

"Commonly viewed through the lens of an interdisciplinary approach to learning, STEM education connects various concepts, skills, and ways of thinking in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. Students build their academic knowledge in the context of and with close connections to real-life applications of that knowledge. The National Research Council described STEM education as an opportunity to build on students’ interests and experiences, engaging them in “fundamental questions about the material and natural world” and immersing them in experiences that are consistent with those of scientists who “carry out empirical investigations and engineering design projects related to core scientific ideas” (NRC 2011, p. 2). Morrison (2006,  pp. 2-3) summarized attributes of STEM education:  1.  Develops problem solvers.

"How can MEAs support the goals  of STEM learning and encourage the development of mathematical expertise? First, the context of solving MEAs allows students to integrate their knowledge of concepts found both inside and outside mathematics. Second, MEAs provide the context for learning new concepts and skills because the problems often require informal explorations and discovering concepts that have yet to be formally introduced. Third, MEAs support the development of problem-solving  abilities, dispositions, and expertise needed for analytical thinking. ",36,mtms2013-02-348a,,
"For example, consider the Choice of the Aluminum Bat MEA (DiefesDux et al. 2006). After receiving science-related background information, students learn that engineers use the size of crystals to determine the strength of the material found in an  aluminum bat. Figure 1 provides part of the context of the problem, and fi gure 2 presents contextual images. The problem, shown in fi gure 3, asks students to analyze micrographic pictures of material crystals.

"The Choice of the Aluminum Bat problem elicits thinking about finding the average area of irregularly shaped figures, given a set of micrographic pictures of aluminum crystals.

"I frequently observed groups who  explained the meaning of this problem to themselves, seeking entry points to its solution, much like Meghan, Betty, and Ashley: ",43,mtms2013-02-348a,,
"Betty: So . . . all we have to do is measure and then get a size, right? Ashley: Yeah . . . , but . . . , not all of  them [the crystals] are the same size. ",44,mtms2013-02-348a,,

Ashley: The problem is that it is hard to measure every single one [each individual crystal] because what is it that you [need to] measure? You can find the area of a square or area of something else. ,52,mtms2013-02-348a,,
"To resolve the problem, the three students made new connections and predictions and asked questions, which helped them view the problem in new ways. In essence, they became problem solvers who could identify relevant mathematical concepts; investigate, collect, organize, and draw conclusions from given information; and contribute to a problem solution, all by applying their prior knowledge and understanding to this new situation.",53,mtms2013-02-348a,,
develops innovators,54,mtms2013-02-348a,,
"Finding the average area of a crystal requires that students design a nonstandard procedure for quantifying area; in so doing, this MEA develops student innovators who can apply known mathematical concepts in a novel way. ",55,mtms2013-02-348a,,
"Grappling and critically thinking about their initial idea of “measuring individual crystals,” Meghan, Betty, and Ashley shifted their attention from thinking about individual  crystals to thinking about examining groups of crystals: ",56,mtms2013-02-348a,,
Ashley: OK. We are not going to sit here and measure each crystal. I know we can’t possibly do that. Betty: Could you choose the largest  one? ,57,mtms2013-02-348a,,
"Meghan: But see, the thing in the problem is that the best one would be the one with the smallest crystals. Ashley: OK, let’s think again. So the  smallest one would be from here to here [pointing at the picture scale]. ",58,mtms2013-02-348a,,
Meghan: What if . . . maybe it isn’t  each individual crystal. Maybe we have to put some of these crystals together. ,59,mtms2013-02-348a,,
"Ashley: Well, yeah, that’s what we have  to figure out. We are gonna count every single crystal that’s inside or just kind of put them together in a little group, so it looks kind of like a square, I don’t know yet. ",60,mtms2013-02-348a,,
"Building on their collaborative ideas, the students developed a procedure which called for— •	 finding	the	area	of	a	square	whose	 side length corresponded to the scale marker on each picture (see fig. 3); •	 counting	the	number	of	crystals enclosed within the selected square; and •	 dividing	the	area	of	the	selected	 square by crystal count. ",61,mtms2013-02-348a,,
"Essentially, these three students became innovators who thought about the average area of an aluminum crystal in terms of the density of crystals per unit area.  develops inventors",62,mtms2013-02-348a,,
Students choose to count crystals in a selected section of a picture (see fig. 4). Meghan observed: “We know how to find average area; the problem is how to count them. Should we count the  fig. 4 Students counted the number of crystals in a selected area to determine the density of the crystals overall.,63,mtms2013-02-348a,,
"ones that are outside, or should we only count the ones that are inside?” [referring to “border crystals” that did not entirely fit within her selected enclosure]. She further expressed her dilemma by asking, “But is it really accurate if we count every single little crystal but not all? Would it be accurate?” ",64,mtms2013-02-348a,,
"Meghan’s questions re-engaged the  students in thinking about and discussing the validity of the previously agreed on plan. They pondered their need for typical-size crystals and how to incorporate crystals on the border of the counting area. Realizing that their initial procedure needed to be optimized, the students formulated an additional decision rule that described how the “border crystals” should be approached in counting: ",65,mtms2013-02-348a,,
Betty: I think we should only take the ones that are inside because these are the ones with the area [inside the square]. ,66,mtms2013-02-348a,,
Meghan: I [also] think we should first count the ones that are fully inside the box and leave out the ones that are split [border crystals]. ,67,mtms2013-02-348a,,
"When Meghan asked, “Would it make a difference if you select your square somewhere in a different place on this picture?” the group began thinking about their solution  fig. 5 the solution showed that students developed an understanding of the area of irregularly shaped figures.",68,mtms2013-02-348a,,
"Dear Coach Meyer,",69,mtms2013-02-348a,,
"We have looked at the data you gave us and finally found  the answer. A is .0014, B is .0052, and C is .0321. We used the measurement they gave us and made a square so we could count the number of crystals inside. We would use 3 different boxes on each, A, B, and C, to find the number of crystals at a more accurate rate.",70,mtms2013-02-348a,,
We used the measurements of the sides to find the area of each square to then divide the area by the number of crystals inside and find the average of the area of each crystal. We used the same thing to find the average areas on B and C.,71,mtms2013-02-348a,,
You can look at the work we did and see the way we found the  answer. We found that bat A would be the best choice to lead your team to many victories.,72,mtms2013-02-348a,,
"Sincerely,",73,mtms2013-02-348a,,
"Ashley, Betty, and Meghan procedure. A follow-up discussion ultimately led to their optimizing the accuracy of their initial procedure. Ashley offered that selecting a different sample square could result in a different result, and Meghan suggested that an acceptably accurate result could be obtained by counting crystals in more sample squares and taking their average.",74,mtms2013-02-348a,,
"These students’ thinking illustrates  how the group worked through the engineering design process in the context of this activity; became inventors who recognized the need to optimize a problem solution; and engaged in cycles of designing, testing, redesigning, and implementing their solution. Building a mathematical description for the problem (see fig. 5 for the final solution description) allowed students to think, in particular, about the area of irregularly shaped figures in a new way. The students also thought about sampling techniques. In this way, this MEA supported mathematical interpretations that cut across different areas of mathematics (i.e., measurement, data analysis) and across different disciplines (i.e., the  scientific context to which the ideas of measurement and data analysis were applied).  develops self-Motivation and self-reliance",75,mtms2013-02-348a,,
"MEAs provide students with the opportunity to develop problem-solving skills, make connections, and think about known concepts in a nonstandard way. These activities also provide an environment in which students’ problem-solving dispositions, such as orientation toward finding a solution, self-motivation, and a propensity for reflecting on their own work, can be promoted. When asked to compare their problem-solving experiences with MEAs to their experiences with solving typical textbook problems, Meghan and Ashley shared these ideas: [I] had to look at the problem this way and that way and [think] which way would be better. I had to be more adventurous, more eager. I’m used to [problems that say] this is what you do and you do it; as opposed to, I’m leaving you an open door, you decide what to do, just tell me why you do it. ",76,mtms2013-02-348a,,
"We’re so used to the idea that the problem wants us to do this and we do it. For this [the problem] we needed to think about options. That’s harder, because we [students] are accustomed to doing what the problem says, and exactly what it says. ",77,mtms2013-02-348a,,
"MEAs provide an environment in which students are naturally encouraged to formulate problems for themselves, set their own problemsolving agendas within specified constraints of MEAs, and self-assess their progress.

"MEAs provide a rich context for students’ rational and logical use of science, mathematics, and engineering design processes. Working collaboratively as a group, students must listen critically and react to one another’s ideas. Meghan reflected on her dilemma related to selecting a representative sample of crystals. She was aware that her group had checked with one another and shared findings and that each rechecked her work because different results were found. She also could articulate that she and her group mates chose to look for an alternative and accurate counting approach as a result. Meghan further shared: ",79,mtms2013-02-348a,,
"I was defending my point of view. Like you can explain and give a motive for doing this . . . because you are able to prove that you did it. . . . Like thinking ahead of the problem and thinking that the steps you are taking are helping you to solve the problem. You start thinking like that, and when you are able to explain it you kind of know that you did the right steps like  you have the information you need, and you are able to explain things.  develops technological literacY",80,mtms2013-02-348a,,
"Technological literacy involves more than knowledge of current technologies and goes far beyond the mere ability to select and use technology that is most appropriate for a given situation. Potter and colleagues  (Potter et al. 2000) describe the ability to conduct inquiry, learn to learn new skills, and work with others as essential indicators of technological literacy. MEAs provide an environment in which students’ can develop these types of skills because MEAs require thinking about methods of gathering, organizing, analyzing, and displaying information; encourage adaptive reasoning as students negotiate initial ideas and understandings with which they approach given problem situation; and develop collaborative problem-solving skills.  to iMpleMent an Mea",81,mtms2013-02-348a,,
"How can teachers use MEAs to best support students’ development of the skills and dispositions discussed here? While engaging groups of students in MEAs, teachers’ efforts should focus on group functioning rather than on providing directions for solution development. Students develop a wide range of problem-solving expertise when they are posed with problems rooted in the dynamics that come from encountering different knowledge and perspectives, in cooperative efforts of selecting variables and negotiating mathematical meaning, or creating or modifying useful mathematical tools.",82,mtms2013-02-348a,,
"For example, to promote the  development of students’ mathematical expertise, teachers can encourage students to reflect on their solution progress. They can encourage members of the group to ask one another questions, invite students to critically evaluate one another’s ideas and reasoning, and encourage groups to share solution models in a class forum. By doing so, teachers can potentially create for their students the opportunity to learn and critically analyze a wider selection of solution approaches and associated mathematical ideas. Students can be encouraged not only to critically listen to and analyze the ideas presented by their peers but also to revise their own solutions as they build on the ideas of others.
