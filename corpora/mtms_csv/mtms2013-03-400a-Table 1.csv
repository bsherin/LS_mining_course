"Sailor Monkeys 1. Three sailors, marooned on an island, spent the day collecting  coconuts. The sailors were too tired at night to count them, so  they agreed to divide them equally the next morning.",2,mtms2013-03-400a,,
"	 •		During	the	night,	one	sailor	 woke up and decided to take his share. He divided the coconuts into 3 equal piles. One coconut was leftover, which he threw to the monkeys on the island. He took his share and left the remaining coconuts in 1 pile.  	 •		Later	that	night,	the	 second sailor awoke and, likewise, decided to take his share. He, too, made  3 equal piles and had  1 coconut leftover, which went to the monkeys. He took his share, and made 1 pile out of the coconuts.  	 •		Before	dawn,	the	third	 sailor awoke and did the same thing with the remaining coconuts.",3,mtms2013-03-400a,,
"In the morning, all three sailors saw the small pile but said nothing. When they divided the remaining coconuts equally, each sailor received 7 coconuts; the 1 leftover went to the monkeys. How many coconuts were in the original pile? 2. Three bands of thieves visited the same ranch one night. The first band  of thieves stole 1/3 of the hay bales in the barn plus 1/3 bale of hay. The second band stole 1/4 of the hay bales plus 1/4 bale. Finally, the last band stole 1/5 of the remaining bales plus 3/5 bale. The next day, the rancher counted 409 bales of hay. He also noted that there was no evidence that any bales of hay had been divided. How many bales of hay were in the barn before the thieves arrived? ",4,mtms2013-03-400a,,
