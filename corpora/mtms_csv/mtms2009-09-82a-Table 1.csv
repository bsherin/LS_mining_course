Most graphs fall into five distinct categories. Show students these five categories and help them understand the graphs that they are sure to see in real life.,2,mtms2009-09-82a,,
"Jennifer J. Wall and Christine C. Benson iInterpreting graphs found in various  content areas is an important skill for students, especially in light of highstakes testing. In addition, reading and understanding graphs is an important part of numeracy, or numeric literacy, a skill necessary for informed citizenry (Steen 1999). Myriad graphs appear in textbooks, magazines, video games, and other media, which make reading and understanding graphs an important part of the mathematics curriculum. Diverse graphs require diverse reasoning.",3,mtms2009-09-82a,,
"When asked to list content areas  for which they need professional development, teachers often say that they are uncomfortable teaching students to create, read, and interpret graphs. ",4,mtms2009-09-82a,,

The following lists some of the terms used in this article. ,7,mtms2009-09-82a,,
Frequency: The precise number of items or times of each occurrence,8,mtms2009-09-82a,,
Example: 15 blue marbles and 10 yellow marbles relative Frequency: The ratio or percentage of each item or occurrence based on the size of the data set,9,mtms2009-09-82a,,
"Example: 60% of the marbles are blue, and 40% of the marbles are yellow categorical data: Data that can be sorted among a set of categories; it is possible that no ordering is logical for the categories",10,mtms2009-09-82a,,
"Example: Counting the numbers of students wearing shoes, sneakers, or sandals to school numerical data: A value or datum that can be ordered according to a numerical attribute",11,mtms2009-09-82a,,

"The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, regardless of your feelings about it, has changed what many teachers teach, how they teach it, and why they teach it. Teachers mention that they spend so much time teaching students how to create the traditional graphs found in their textbooks that they have little time to focus on reading and interpreting graphs, especially the new types of graphs that students see in popular media. ",15,mtms2009-09-82a,,
"As we prepared resources to support teachers and as we taught our own preservice teachers, two subtexts became clear: 1. As with all mathematics, students think better and understand more when the mathematics is presented in a meaningful context.  2. We can reduce much of the confusion experienced by students when  fig. 1 the bar graph (a) uses area to indicate frequency; the circle graph (b) uses area to indicate relative frequency. the circle graph allows the user to compare one area with the whole.",16,mtms2009-09-82a,,

(a)  (b) interpreting both traditional and new graphs by categorizing these different graphs according to the reasoning involved. ,18,mtms2009-09-82a,,
Focusing on the big ideas or concepts that graphs have in common is more useful and less time-consuming than studying many individual graphs.,19,mtms2009-09-82a,,
"While analyzing various graphs found in newspapers and magazines and on the Internet, we discovered an interesting way of categorizing graphs. The majority of graphs use shading, area, or position to show either frequency (e.g., the number of blue pencils in a box) or attribute (e.g., the average height of trees). By teaching students the features of these categories and  using different types of graphs as examples, students will be better prepared to read and understand both traditional and new graphs that they may see in school and in the media. The alternative is trying to teach each type of graph that may be encountered.  1. area indicates frequency",20,mtms2009-09-82a,,
"Many common graphs, such as bar graphs, circle graphs, histograms, stem-and-leaf plots, thermometer charts, and cartograms, use area to indicate frequency or relative frequency. ",21,mtms2009-09-82a,,
"Bar graphs and circle graphs represent categorical data, which allow each category to be compared with other categories. The areas of  the bars indicate frequency or relative frequency; the areas of the sectors of the circle indicate relative frequencies of the categories. A small area indicates a small (relative) frequency; a large area indicates a large (relative) frequency. ",22,mtms2009-09-82a,,
"Circle graphs allow the user to compare one category to the whole data set, which bar graphs do not do. In figure 1, both the bar graph and the circle graph show that there are more blue pencils than yellow pencils in the package. However, by comparing areas, the circle graph shows that blue pencils comprise nearly one-half the pencils in the package and that the yellow pencils make up about one-tenth. The circle graph allows the reader to compare the part (one color of pencil) to the whole (the package of pencils), unlike the bar graph. An added advantage of studying circle graphs is that students will develop skill with percentages and estimations as they create and interpret circle graphs and histograms (NCTM 2006). ",23,mtms2009-09-82a,,
"Whereas bar graphs and circle  graphs are often used for categorical data, histograms and stem-and-leaf plots are specifically used for numerical data. Histograms, similar to bar graphs, use the areas of the bars to indicate frequencies or relative frequencies. However, rather than the bars representing frequencies within categories (e.g., color, gender, school), they represent frequencies within intervals of numerical data (e.g., ranges of numeric test scores, ages, weights). The stem-and-leaf plot and histogram in figure 2 plot the same 33 test scores. The area of each bar in the histogram and the area, or length, of each leaf row in the stem-and-leaf plot indicate the frequency of test scores in each interval. ",24,mtms2009-09-82a,,
"One may argue that bar graphs,  histograms, and stem-and-leaf plots focus on the height, rather  fig. 3 three-dimensional bar graphs can be misleading, as seen in the examples in (a) and (b). only graph (c) shows an appropriate three-dimensional representation of the data.  (a)  (b)  (c) than the area, of the bars, which is generally correct. However, the graphs in figure 3 refute this argument. These graphs are examples of pictograms, which use illustrations to represent the bars of a bar graph. The difference in the sizes of the three-dimensional fireworks catches the readers’ attention, which is why it is important for the bars to be a uniform width so that only one dimension is changing. For example, the three graphs in figure 3 intend to demonstrate that injuries caused by fireworks are three times more likely to occur to males as to females. However, because the larger  rocket in figure 3a is not only three times as tall as the smaller one but also three times as wide, the ratio of the areas is actually 9 to 1. If we consider the shading for a threedimensional effect, the larger rocket is three times as tall, wide, and deep, and the perceived volume ratio becomes 33:13, or 27:1. ",25,mtms2009-09-82a,,
"Although the user may note the  scale of the vertical axis to see that the percent of firework injuries occurring in males was 75 percent, the impression is that they differ by a factor of 27 (see fig. 3a) or 9 (see fig. 3b), instead of 3 (see fig. 3c). The area, and in the case of the fireworks, the perceived volume, makes the greater impression. Because the graph depicts  fig. 4 a cartogram uses area to indicate frequency; in the case of this cartogram, population. States are red or blue indicating the electoral College’s voting in the 2008 presidential election. the red states went to mcCain; the blue states went to obama.",26,mtms2009-09-82a,,
"mark NeWmaN; httP://WWW-PerSoNal.umICh.edu/~meJN/eleCtIoN/2008/ a comparison in percent of firework injuries (one variable) by gender, the comparison in the illustrations should be shown by altering just one dimension (Tufte 1983).",27,mtms2009-09-82a,,
The firework examples in figure 3 are misleading graphs. Asking students why various graphs are misleading promotes higher-level thinking and great discussions. Misleading examples illustrate some important rules when constructing graphs (e.g. keep the width of the bars uniform). ,28,mtms2009-09-82a,,
"For more information about qualities of well-constructed graphs, see Tufte (1983).",29,mtms2009-09-82a,,
"Thermometer charts, cartograms, and wind roses are less common than the previously mentioned graphs but do appear in media. They are good extension examples of graphs that use area to indicate frequency. For example, groups raising funds for various causes often use a chart resembling a thermometer to indicate how much money has been  fig. 5 this graph uses color to indicate frequency, in this case, the strike zone for a baseball player.",30,mtms2009-09-82a,,
"kurtIS FINk raised. The top of the thermometer is the annual goal. As more money is raised, the shaded area of the thermometer increases. This common fund-raising illustration is often overlooked as a type of graph. Figure 4 shows a cartogram, which also uses area to show frequency. Students may encounter this graph in media or textbooks. In this map, the size of the states is related to their population rather than their area. As the description of this graph at http://www-personal.umich.",31,mtms2009-09-82a,,
fig. 6 Students can make graphs that use shading to indicate frequency. this image shows that a grocery store stocks its cereal shelves with the lower-fiber cereals on the bottom and higher-fiber cereals on the top. ,32,mtms2009-09-82a,,
Fiber Content of Cereals arranged on a Shelf at the grocery Store key n represents more than 2.5 grams per serving n represents more than 1 and less than 2.5 grams per serving n represents 1 or fewer grams per serving fig. 7 this map uses color to indicate attribute. a common example is temperatures across the united States.,33,mtms2009-09-82a,,
"edu/~mejn/election/2008/ explains: “The state of Rhode Island, with its 1.1 million inhabitants, would appear about twice the size of Wyoming, which has half a million, even though Wyoming has 60 times the acreage of Rhode Island” (Newman 2008). Whereas other graphs allow you to look at the area to determine the actual percent represented, the cartogram only allows the reader to compare states according to a specific characteristic.  2. shading indicates frequency",34,mtms2009-09-82a,,
"Using area to represent frequency is common, but some graphs indicate frequency using different colors or patterns of shading (e.g., lines or dots). The graph in figure 5 shows the strike zone for a particular baseball player. The user can see the parts of the strike zone where this player had the most success hitting various pitches. After viewing this graph, the opposing pitcher and catcher would know which parts of the strike zone to avoid. This is an effective way to use shading to represent frequency. A graph using area to indicate frequency would be much less effective. ",35,mtms2009-09-82a,,
"Figure 5’s graph is similar to those found in sports media. We created it using Mathematica, a sophisticated program that is better suited to older students. However, similar graphs that use shading to indicate frequency can be produced using Excel, as was the graph in figure 6. Each cell represents a box of cereal on a grocery store shelf. The shading of the cell indicates the amount of fiber in that box of cereal. The reader can see that the cereals on the lower shelves have less fiber per serving than those on the top shelves. When creating these graphs, it is important to use shadings (e.g., light to dark) that enhance, not detract from, the interpretation (Tufte 1983).  3. area and shading indicate attributes",36,mtms2009-09-82a,,
"Where some graphs convey frequencies, other graphs convey attributes using shading, area, or position. The map in figure 7 uses different colors to convey the temperatures on May 29, 2009, throughout the United States. Elevation maps use different shadings to indicate regional elevations. ",37,mtms2009-09-82a,,
"Radar graphs, on the other  hand, use area to convey degrees of a number of attributes. Examples are shown in figures 8 and 9. These graphs are used in the popular video game called Digital Dance Revolution (DDR). There are three levels of difficulty—heavy, standard, and light—for each song. Additionally, the game designers produced five attributes—air, voltage, stream, chaos, and freeze—of the songs that are used in the game. The graph for the light level takes up less area than the graph for the heavy level, which tells the reader that the light level is easier than the heavy level. You can also see that the air attribute remains constant in difficulty between the standard and heavy levels, whereas the stream attribute increases steadily from light to standard to heavy levels. ",38,mtms2009-09-82a,,
"The radar graph in figure 8 allows  the user to see the difference in difficulty levels for one song; however, the radar graph in figure 9 is used to compare different songs within the same difficulty level. Since the graph for song 3 has a smaller area than that for song 1, the reader can conclude that song 3 is the more difficult. ",39,mtms2009-09-82a,,
"Before parent-teacher conferences,  your students could make a radar graph to show their parents their grades. The grade categories could be labeled homework, test, and quiz. During the conference, the students can explain the graphs and their grades to their parents.  fig. 8 a radar graph uses area to indicate attribute. In this case, the amounts of five different attributes in the “heavy,” “standard,” and “light” versions of a particular song are expressed. ",40,mtms2009-09-82a,,
"Comparing three difficulty levels for one Song fig. 9 While also using area to indicate attribute, this radar graph’s larger area implies a more difficult song.",41,mtms2009-09-82a,,
Comparing the three Songs on one radar graph fig. 10 a bar graph can also use area to indicate attribute.,42,mtms2009-09-82a,,
average height of trees  in local Forest,43,mtms2009-09-82a,,
"Another type of graph that can  use area to indicate attribute is a bar graph. We mentioned bar graphs when discussing area to indicate frequency, but bar graphs can also indicate attribute, as shown in figure 10. The user can see that the average height of blue spruce trees in the local forest is less than the average height of Douglas fir and white pine. ",44,mtms2009-09-82a,,
"Although it is still a bar graph, the reasoning involved in its interpretation  is not the same as with the previous bar graphs in this article because the area of the bar has nothing to do with the number of trees in each category. However, students will often look at such a graph and say that there are more Douglas fir trees than white pine. Instead, they should see that on average the Douglas fir are taller than the white pine. To help students understand these differences in rea- soning, students need to see different types of graphs and discuss the types of reasoning involved.",45,mtms2009-09-82a,,
4. position indicates attribute,46,mtms2009-09-82a,,
"In some graphs, the position of the icons or lines indicates information about one or more variables. For example, some weather maps show lightning icons to indicate where lightning has  fig. 11 a scatter plot uses positions to indicate the values of variables. related sets of data can be shown on the same graph.",47,mtms2009-09-82a,,
"occurred. Scatter plots and line graphs use position to show the relationship of multiple variables. With scatter plots, the positions of the icons show the values of two different variables at the same time, indicating their relationship. A third categorical variable can be introduced by using different icons or colors. For example, figure 11’s scatter plot shows icicles formed at different water flow rates in a chamber with no wind at −11° C over time. The graph illustrates the relationship among the water flow rate, time, and the length of the icicles.",48,mtms2009-09-82a,,
"Figure 12’s wind-rose graphs combine the concepts mentioned above. They use area to represent relative frequency and use shading to represent attribute. The position of the bars indicates the direction from which the wind comes. The length and area indicate the relative frequency, based on all winds in the time period for that location. The shading indicates the speed category, in miles per second, of the winds. ",49,mtms2009-09-82a,,
"Readers can use wind roses in general to compare the winds in different  fig. 12 Wind-rose graphs use area, shading, and position to convey information about wind strength and direction.",50,mtms2009-09-82a,,

The wind roses for two time periods on Upper Klamath Lake, Oregon, are shown in figure 12. The winter winds generally come from the north-northwest and southeast, whereas spring winds are generally out of the west. Students should also note the relative frequency, as expressed along the left side of the graph. (More detailed information is embedded in these wind roses for students who need more challenge.)  5. graphs shoW variation",51,mtms2009-09-82a,,
"Although area usually indicates frequency or attributes, area occasionally indicates variation. Box plots, often called box-and-whisker plots, are graphs that most students will see on standardized tests. Unfortunately,  many students struggle with them and do not understand why such a simplelooking graph, as shown in figure 13, can be so confusing to interpret. Students often think the whiskers are thin rectangles; therefore, intuitively, when they see a longer rectangle, they expect it to represent a higher frequency of data. But box plots are broken into four sections, or quartiles. Twenty-five percent of the data is between the lowest number and the maximum of the first quartile. Similarly, 25 percent of the data occurs between the first quartile marker and the second quartile marker, or median, and so on. If the length of one section is greater than the width of another section, then the variation in the data in the longer section is greater than the variation in the data of the shorter section. The values are more dense in the shorter section. It is difficult for  fig. 13 a box plot, or box-and-whisker plot, uses area to indicate variation.",52,mtms2009-09-82a,,
students to grasp that both sections contain the same amount of data. ,53,mtms2009-09-82a,,
"Since box plots are not similar to  any other graphs with which students are familiar, such as bar graphs, it is imperative that teachers discuss the conceptual difference between this type of graph and other graphs. If students do not understand this difference, they will think that there are more data ",54,mtms2009-09-82a,,

  NCTM journals  met709_428    ideas for  teaching       graphs,61,mtms2009-09-82a,,
"In Principles and Standards for School Mathematics, NCTM expects students in grades 6 through 8 to be able to “select, create, and use appropriate graphical representations of data, including histograms, box plots, and scatterplots” (NCTM 2000, p. 248). Students need to be able to confidently read many different types of graphs, including those that are less frequently used, so that they can quickly understand unfamiliar graphs on standardized tests, in their textbooks, and in public media. Therefore, teaching graphs is an important piece of mathematics education. ",62,mtms2009-09-82a,,
"To give students greater exposure to the various graph possibilities, have students search for interesting graphs in newspapers or magazines and bring them to class to share. You can collect these graphs, which can then be used in the future. ",63,mtms2009-09-82a,,
"For each graph that students bring in, discuss how to read it and its  advantages and disadvantages. Challenge students to make a different type of graph using the same data. ",64,mtms2009-09-82a,,
"For example, if the graph uses shading to indicate frequency, challenge students to create one in which area indicates frequency. You can also ask students to collect data on a topic that is interesting to them and represent those data using some new type of graph that they create. They must then share and justify their new graphs. The data may be information from their science, physical education, or social studies classes or it could be information that they find outside of school. The context for the data must be interesting to the students. ",65,mtms2009-09-82a,,
"No matter what activity you use, it is important that classes discuss the different conceptual categories of graphs so that students understand the big picture. In real life, they will encounter graphs that they have never seen before. They will need to acquire the analytical tools necessary to forge through the information.",66,mtms2009-09-82a,,
"points in the longest section of the graph than in the shorter sections. For example, in figure 13, if students know that there are twenty-four students in class 2, they should understand that there are about six scores in each section of the graph. The fact that the left section of the box is longer than the right section indicates that the six  scores in the right section (between the median and the third quartile) are less spread out than the six scores in the left section of the box. ",67,mtms2009-09-82a,,
"Asking students to compare box  plots can help them understand these differences. Given the three box plots in figure 13, ask students to determine which class performed best on  the test. The students should see that the median score of class 2 is higher than the median scores of the other two classes, showing that 50 percent of class 2 students earned almost 80 points. However, class 3 produced the highest score, and 25 percent of class 3 students scored better than most of class 2. On the other hand, classes 2 and 3 produced scores that were lower than those found in class 1. ",68,mtms2009-09-82a,,
"Classroom discussion leads to a better understanding of what box plots convey. The discussion will allow you, as the teacher, to see if students are interpreting the box plots correctly. Many other comparisons can be made among the three classes; however, the number of students in each class cannot be determined. The areas of the boxes do not represent frequencies; they represent the spread or the variation of the data.",69,mtms2009-09-82a,,
conclusion,70,mtms2009-09-82a,,
"Reading and interpreting graphs is an important skill for all students. Not only should students be able to understand common graphs, they should also be able to read graphs with which they are unfamiliar. This skill can be developed by discussing the main categories of graphs that— 1. use area to show frequency and attribute, 2. use shading to indicate frequency, 3. use shading to indicate attribute, 4. use position to indicate attribute, and 5. show variation.
