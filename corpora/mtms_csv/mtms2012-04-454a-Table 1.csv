"Johnnie Wilson iI posed the Handshake problem to  my seventh-grade students. I asked them to find a way to determine how many handshakes could occur for any size group of people if every person shakes hands with every other person just once. It is a classic problem, and there are a number of ways to represent a solution. We did a lot of handshaking in class. We also drew diagrams and constructed tables to represent what we found.",2,mtms2012-04-454a,,
"At the end of class, the students  had some inkling about what was happening in the problem. Some were tantalizingly close to finding a general rule. I suggested that they take the problem home and try it out with their parents. I was surprised by what they brought back the next day.",3,mtms2012-04-454a,,
"Before the students had settled in their seats the following class, three students wanted to share what they had found. They had that look of satisfaction on their faces that comes when one has untied the knot of a really good problem. I had a plan for looking at the problem, but their enthusiasm made me change my mind about the best way to get the most out of the task. Instead, I asked the eager three to share their solutions with their classmates. Three groups formed, and explanations were drawn, ",4,mtms2012-04-454a,,

I could hear the surprise voiced by students as they caught on. The three students did a good job of helping their classmates better understand the problem and find a general rule for the pattern. The students returned to their seats so that we could discuss the findings as a class.",5,mtms2012-04-454a,,
"The three students who were so anxious to share their solutions were girls. This in itself may not be so interesting; on any day, any combination of boys or girls might have the same enthusiasm for a problem. What is interesting is what followed in our class discussion. Each of the girls took turns sharing. I asked clarifying questions. I also asked how they had found a solution. Each one said that she had worked on the problem with her father the night before. ",6,mtms2012-04-454a,,
"Then Sophia, one of the three,  asked a surprising but necessary question: “Why does everyone in school go to their dad when they need help with math? Why don’t they go to their mom?” Other students got involved in the discussion, and the Handshake problem was soon forgotten. One student said that it is because dads are better at math. I asked if this was true. Students shared all kinds of opinions. Sophia shared  that in her culture, men are supposed to learn math and science and women are supposed to study the arts and humanities. Another said that it is because dads go out into the world and work with jobs that need math while moms mostly stay home. I asked if this was true for everyone. There were mixed responses. ",7,mtms2012-04-454a,,
"I teach at an international school,  so some of the discussion involved different cultural expectations for boys and girls and mathematics. A general theme across this discussion was that in most places, girls are not expected to learn as much mathematics as boys and that math will not be important in their adult lives. I then shared that I knew this was not true for a number of the moms of students in the classroom. I reminded them that the mother of one boy in the class worked as a scientist and probably knew more math than I. The boy responded that his dad was a scientist, too. Students laughed, and some remarked that was the reason why he was good at math. ",8,mtms2012-04-454a,,
"Class was nearly over, and I did not want the conversation to end so simply. What did it mean that three bright, capable girls could be such a resource for other students’ problem solving while they themselves sought out their fathers, not their mothers, for the same? I closed the conversation by reminding them that someday many of them would be parents. Then I asked the necessary question: When you are grown and have children of your own, will they come to you for math help? ",9,mtms2012-04-454a,,
"Later, I thought about what this  conversation means for my math teaching. I realized that, with or without my intent, some of what I teach will be passed along to my students’ children as some kind of mathematical legacy. Not just the good parts, the interesting ideas and ways of thinking, but also the difficult parts. Those difficult parts are the failures, the ",10,mtms2012-04-454a,,
"She asked, “Why does everyone in school go to their  dad when they need help with math?  Why don’t they go  to their mom?”  frustrations, and the uncertainties that come with doing math. For those who mostly experience the challenge of doing mathematics but rarely experience the satisfaction, how will they respond when their children ask for math help?",11,mtms2012-04-454a,,
"I thought about the parents of  my students and how they carry the legacy of their own mathematical education. Over the years, many parents have shared with me a concern for their own understanding of mathematics. Too often, they have worried that their way of doing math was not right; it was not like the math we do at school, so they could not help their children. Too often, they have been embarrassed to tell me that they do not believe they are good enough to help their child with math. Too often, these conversations have been with mothers.",12,mtms2012-04-454a,,
"If I expect my students to one day teach math to their own children, how should I be teaching them? Here is what comes to mind.",13,mtms2012-04-454a,,
"I should teach so that the challenge and work of doing mathematics are tied to the satisfaction of solving problems and comprehending new perspectives through mathematics. I should teach with the expectation that my students are learning the mathematics not only for themselves  but also to teach others someday. My students should have opportunities to teach others now, not just in some future life. They should teach their peers. They should teach their siblings. They should even teach their parents.",14,mtms2012-04-454a,,
"I should teach with particular attention to the expectations for girls and mathematics. Whether those expectations are by parents, classmates, or by the girls themselves, I should question what those expectations mean for their mathematics learning now and for their future.",15,mtms2012-04-454a,,
"I should pay as much attention to how we do math as to the substance of mathematics. The important ideas of math will be available to my students at any time in their lives through textbooks. To teach others, these students will need to embody the attitudes that make it possible for anyone to learn math well. They need to learn how to be persistent, how to change perspectives, how to ask the right questions, how to admit mistakes, and how to show what they know so that their ideas are accessible to others. ",16,mtms2012-04-454a,,
"I should teach so that students  understand that the mathematics they are learning is, in fact, a legacy of ideas. They need to know that others have worked hard to build mathematics and that the ideas are meant to be shared. By everyone.",17,mtms2012-04-454a,,
"Maybe I should ask them not to simply defer to Dad for math homework. Maybe I should ask them to work with Mom, too.",18,mtms2012-04-454a,,
"Johnnie Wilson, johnniebwilson@gmail .com, teaches middle school mathematics at Munich International School in Starnberg, Germany. He is interested in how teachers draw on students’ mathematical communication to build their mathematical thinking, especially the communication of students learning English in addition to their native languages.",19,mtms2012-04-454a,,
