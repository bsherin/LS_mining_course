11,Have a Slice of Pizza,FIELD-TEST COMMENTS,11,Have a Slice of Pizza
12,Have a Slice of Pizza,"I used “Have a Slice of Pizza” with my sixth-grade gifted and talented class. Many of these students are in advanced math. I placed them in groups of four to work on the cartoon. I displayed the actual problem on the overhead projector by making the comic and the questions into a PowerPoint® display. I gave each group a large piece of paper to work with. This helped them to explain their thinking to everyone at the table. They enjoyed solving the first two questions, but we were only able to finish those few. It took us half an hour. ",12,Have a Slice of Pizza
13,Have a Slice of Pizza,"There were a lot of great math  discussions because students had to rely heavily on prior knowledge because this was not a topic that we were currently working on in math. Students used modeling and equations to solve it. They enjoyed making many different combinations of pizzas to feed the class, making sure everyone got the types of pizza that they wanted. However, they wanted to scrap the mushroom choice and get a meat lovers version instead. I suppose if I had cut this argument short we could have gotten further. I would prefer to plan more time so that the students stay invested in the work.",13,Have a Slice of Pizza

20,Have a Slice of Pizza,  The central angle for the cheese  pizza        = 360° ÷ 8 slices = 45°    The central angle for the pepperoni  pizza        = 360° ÷ 5 slices = 72° 5.  The number of large pizzas usually ordered is 20. Each pie has a surface area of around 201 in.2. We need at least 20 • 201 = 4020 in.2  of pizza to feed the school. The surface area of the medium pizza is about 113 in.2 ,20,Have a Slice of Pizza
21,Have a Slice of Pizza,"The pizza conundrum was actually a real challenge on a recent field trip, so my sixth-grade prealgebra students compared FoxTrot’s problem to ours! Applying area formulas in a variety of scenarios, students calculated the area  of cheese, mushroom, and pepperoni. When we got to question 5, I had to give them our field trip problem.",21,Have a Slice of Pizza
22,Have a Slice of Pizza,"On the trip, we had to order pizza  for 30 people. The restaurant had large 16 inch pizzas for $15, and we planned to order 10. A special offer was available. Medium 12 inch pizzas were “buy one for $12 and get one free.” Much like the FoxTrot problem, we had to make a decision about purchasing pizza. Knowing we were saving money, we ordered 10 pizzas and received 20 medium pizzas. Needless to say, we had extra pizza. The challenge I gave my prealgebra students was to calculate how many we really should have ordered. It was a practical application that they enjoyed tackling.",22,Have a Slice of Pizza

26,Have a Slice of Pizza,OTHER IDEAS,26,Have a Slice of Pizza
27,Have a Slice of Pizza,"Extend this Cartoon Corner with these ideas: • Have students solve for the volume for each type of deep-dish pizza if the depth is 3 inches. (Solution: Cheese: 200.96 in.2 × 3 in. ≈ 602.88 in.3; pepperoni: 176.63 in.2 × 3 in. ≈ 529.89 in.3; mushroom: 113.04 in.2 × 3 in. ≈ 339.12 in.3.)  • Have students solve a word problem that includes varying percentages: A large pizza at the Math Pizza Shop is $12.99. Today, there is a sale in which you get 10 percent off all large pizzas. You get an additional 15 percent off large  pizzas after your first two. If you want to buy four large pizzas, what is the total amount due before tax? (Solution: L1 = $12.99, L2 = 12.99; (L1 + L2) × 90% ≈ $23.38; and (L3 + L4) × 75% ≈ $19.49. Therefore, L1 + L2 + L3 + L4 = $42.87.)  (Solution: $12.99 × 4 = $51.96, $51.96 – $42.87 = $9.09 in total savings.)   What is the total amount of money you saved from the original pricing?  • Have students find the total cost of three large pizzas ($12.99 each),  including the tip for the delivery driver (20 percent), and tax (7 percent). Note: The tip should be based on the cost of the pizzas plus tax. ($12.99 × 3 = $38.97, (0.07) × $38.97 ≈ $2.73, $38.97 + $2.73 = $41.70 before tip. Tip: $41.70 × 20% = $8.34. The total cost of the pizzas including tax and the driver’s tip is $38.97 + $2.73 + $8.34 = $50.04.)",27,Have a Slice of Pizza
