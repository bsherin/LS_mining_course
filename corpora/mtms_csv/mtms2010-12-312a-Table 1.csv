"Pincity is a company that sells prepaid calling cards. Maria had $3.46 worth of calling time in her Pincity account, and she wanted to add to it. At that time, Pincity was offering two promotions. The “Santa Claus Is Coming to Pincity” promotion used the promotional code SANTA30. The “YearEnd 5-Day Special” offer contained the promotional code NYBONUS.  2.  If Maria were to add $20 to  her Pincity account using the  SANTA30 code, how much would she be charged for the $20 worth of calling time? 5.  In both cases, Maria received $6  more of calling time than what she actually paid for. Explain why one promotion might be considered better than the other.  3.  If Maria were to add $20 to  her Pincity account using the  NYBONUS code, how many dollars of calling time would she receive for her $20 payment? 4.  How are a “30% discount” and a  “30% bonus” different? edited by erik tillema,	etillema@iupui .edu,	who	teaches	at	Indiana	University	in	",3,mtms2010-12-312a,,

"  Payment amount is 4.  A 30% discount means you pay 30% less than what you are supposed to pay. (For example, you pay $70 to get $100 worth of calling time.) A 30% bonus means you get an additional 30% worth of calling time. (For example, you receive $130 worth of calling time for the $100 you pay.)  $20 – $6 = $14.  5.

"ence is the same, $6. However, the relative difference (i.e., the percent change) is not the same. With SANTA30, Maria gets $6 free for every $14 spent, whereas with NYBONUS she gets $6 free for every $20 spent. So she will have to pay more with NYBONUS to  get the same amount of free calling time.     Another way to see this:  •		The	promotion	SANTA30	 provides 20/14 ≈ 1.43 times what Maria pays for, which is 43% more for her money.",18,mtms2010-12-312a,,
