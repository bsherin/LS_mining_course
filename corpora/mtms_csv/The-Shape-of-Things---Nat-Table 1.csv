30,The Shape of Things - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,SOLUTIONS,,
31,The Shape of Things - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,1. Yes. Vivian is isosceles because she has 2 congruent sides. Frank does not have a hypotenuse because he is not a right triangle. The dolls are equilateral triangles because all 3 sides appear congruent. (Children often like to have perfect dolls.),,
32,The Shape of Things - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"2. Sample answers: The baby takes after Frank because it appears that she has an obtuse angle (which would make her obtuse like her father). The baby takes after both parents because it appears that she has a right angle, like Vivian, and is scalene, like Frank.",,

44,The Shape of Things - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,FIELD-TEST COMMENTS,,
45,The Shape of Things - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"My fifth-grade students used this activity to practice reading for a purpose, using the textbook as a resource. (Our middle school focus last year was to improve reading comprehension.)",,
46,The Shape of Things - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"After discussing the punny cartoon, the class explored the table of contents, the index, and the glossary. Using the word hypotenuse from the cartoon, they practiced interpreting definitions and diagrams, including using the page number that sent them to the chapter for a more in-depth explanation. Then they worked with partners to complete the activity. As the class checked their answers, each student had to justify their word choice. For example, they were familiar with the term quadrilateral, so they knew that quad- meant four and selected quadrant for Four rant.",,

50,The Shape of Things - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In preparation for testing this activity with my sixth-grade class, we completed a one-day lesson about using protractors. Students knew what a protractor was and generally what it was used for, but they would not have been able to do problem 3 without this review. Afterward, most students were able to draw the triangles. The most important thing they learned from doing problem 3 was the discovery of geometric theorems. From problem 3a, they learned about proportional triangles; from 3b and 3c, they learned about SSS and SAS. They were amazed that they could draw different-size triangles with angles with degrees measuring 30, 60, and 90.",,
51,The Shape of Things - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The students needed a little prompting with problem 4. After I filled in a few blanks, they realized that they were looking for puns. After finishing the activity sheet, I asked them to look up the correct definitions. Then I provided another activity sheet that I had created with drawings that represented each term. Although students were not familiar with a few terms, they were able to write the terms below the drawings.",,
52,The Shape of Things - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I found that the time spent doing the cartoon was beneficial. Depending on the grade, this activity could easily be used as a one-day stand-alone lesson or used within a unit on geometry.",,

55,The Shape of Things - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Carlisle, Pennsylvania",,
56,The Shape of Things - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"My sixth-grade prealgebra classes tend to be literal, so they measured Vivians sides and angles. They concluded that she was not isosceles based on the data, thus leading to a discussion about shapes drawn to scale. They wondered if Vivian was inferring that she was isosceles. A consensus was never reached, but this undoubtedly will add to future mathematical discourse. Franks obtuse angle was readily apparent, and several students noted that he could not have a hypotenuse because of that!",,
57,The Shape of Things - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Constructing triangles was the real challenge. Students worked in pairs using whiteboards and were able to bounce ideas off one another. Discussions ranged from I dont remember how to use the protractor to 30-60-90 is a special right triangle; I know how to make that to If the sides are all 6 cm, then the angles must all measure 60 degrees. The whiteboards provided opportunities for conversations and an easier way to experience trial and error.",,
58,The Shape of Things - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The puns were hysterical (and often followed by groans), and the class concluded with one students favorite math joke: What insect is the best in math class? A mosquito: It adds to our frustration, subtracts our pleasure, divides our attention, and multiplies quickly!",,

62,The Shape of Things - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I used this cartoon with a group of eighth-grade students who share a love of math jokes, and they thoroughly enjoyed this activity. I introduced the cartoon in class, and we analyzed why it was funny. The students then used  iPods and their textbook glossary to refresh their memory about the geometric terms. I asked them to work first on the definitions because they were so excited to solve them. They were tickled with the pun for hypotenuse, which became our schools Joke of the Day.",,
63,The Shape of Things - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"For homework, I let the students explore with the ruler and protractor to finish the activity sheet. We later discussed the importance of reading the protractor correctly as well as the importance of finding reasonable answers. As an extension, my students created their own puns related to geometric terms that they would later turn into comics.",,

66,The Shape of Things - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Phoenix, Arizona",,
67,The Shape of Things - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I tried this activity with both my prealgebra and geometry students. I changed the questions for the geometry class to include constructing, rather than drawing, the triangles. (I also changed the angle for problem 3c from 20 degrees to 22 1/2 degrees for the construction.) If this activity were given earlier in the year, drawing might still be appropriate for a geometry class, but at a later time I would rather have them construct. My students loved the matching, which added humor to the comic, especially because they were not expecting it.",,
68,The Shape of Things - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"My prealgebra students were working on a geometry unit in February, so introducing this cartoon early in the year would not have fit well in the curriculum because of students lack of knowledge of several terms. They enjoyed drawing figures, and for some students it was a challenge to find different shapes that had the same given information. I asked these students to explore the side-side-angle (SSA) case (without using these terms, of course), and they had fun.",,

73,The Shape of Things - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The measurements given in problem 3c follow the format of side-angle-side, or SAS. For each of the following, ask students to determine if the given criteria results in 1 unique triangle, 2 possible triangles, or infinitely many possible triangles: AAS, ASA, SSA, SSS, and AAA. (The criteria given by AAS, ASA, and SSS result in  1 unique triangle. SSA results in 2 possible triangles. AAA  results in infinitely many  possible triangles.)",,
