"Teachers strive to provide a context for their mathematics lessons. LiteratureBased Activities for Integrating Mathematics with Other Content Areas presents examples of books, stories, and reference works that can be used as part of activities relating mathematics to other subject  areas. The book’s engaging activities span a wide range of topics, from the wonders of the ancient world to U.S. presidents and their pets.",1,mtms2009-10-182a,,
"This book is directed specifically at  grades 6−8 and describes more than thirty separate lessons that are divided into three major categories: relating mathematics to science, social studies, and the visual arts.",2,mtms2009-10-182a,,
"The lessons are interactive, so they will usually require some preparation and modification before they can be used with students. I reviewed the list of literature used for the book’s lessons. Only about 30 percent of those books were available at my middle school. However, almost 70 percent of the books were available throughout my school district. Even though the mathematics activities in this book are age-appropriate, many are based on  books that are found predominantly in elementary school libraries.",3,mtms2009-10-182a,,
This book’s lessons do a good job of encouraging mathematical thought and communication while addressing students’ varied learning styles.,4,mtms2009-10-182a,,

Some are mere curiosities, such as patterns that always produce a certain result, whereas others have useful applications, such as a shortcut for finding the sum of a series. The language is generally simple, with clear examples presented in a straightforward manner. Each “visit” involves one to five pages of reading, including solutions.",17,mtms2009-10-182a,,
"All material is accessible to a student who can add, subtract, multiply, and divide with multidigit whole numbers. The patterns are interesting and unusual enough to intrigue moreadvanced students. Any additional background mathematics needed, such as factor trees, exponents, and the volume of cubes, is explained clearly and simply through the characters’ conversations.",18,mtms2009-10-182a,,
The author clearly enjoys numbers and patterns and has found an engaging way to pass on this enjoyment to readers. This book is appropriate for those who enjoy playing with numbers or who might come to enjoy it when they experience success during a few “visits.” ,19,mtms2009-10-182a,,

The Pyramath Card Game consists of a deck of 56 cards numbered 0–9 to be used by elementary school students to practice their mathematics facts. ,24,mtms2009-10-182a,,
"To start the game, a series of cards are laid out. Players look at two side- by-side cards and determine the sum, difference, product, or quotient of the two numbers. If they pick a card from the draw pile matching one of the answers, it is placed between the two cards, starting the next level of the pyramid. A winner is declared when the pyramid is completed. ",25,mtms2009-10-182a,,
"Single-digit addition and singledigit multiplication problems resulting in a double-digit answer require a variation. The deck contains only single-digit cards, so students ignore the tens digit and use the ones digit to build the card pyramid.
