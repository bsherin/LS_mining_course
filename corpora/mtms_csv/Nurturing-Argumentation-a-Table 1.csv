3,Nurturing Argumentation and Reasoning with Pentominoes,"The NCTM Process Standards call for all students to “develop and evaluate mathematical arguments” and “recognize reasoning . . . as [a] fundamental aspect of mathematics” (NCTM 2000, p. 122). Moreover, the Common Core State Standards emphasize the importance of students being able to “construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others” (CCSSI 2010, p. 6). In particular, middle school students need opportunities to craft informal mathematical arguments beyond justification of steps in an algorithm. Pentominoes (Golomb 1954) provide an excellent vehicle for such activity, engaging students in the following types of argumentation: 1.  Justifying that a set of generated  examples is complete 2.  Confirming conjectures",3,Nurturing Argumentation and Reasoning with Pentominoes

5,Nurturing Argumentation and Reasoning with Pentominoes,"In addition, pentominoes encourage an exploration of proportionality and scaling. For instance, the following questions are readily explored with the manipulatives: 4.  When an object is enlarged, what  area and perimeter relationships exist between the smaller object and the larger object? 5.  When an object is enlarged, what  pieces completely fill it?",5,Nurturing Argumentation and Reasoning with Pentominoes

8,Nurturing Argumentation and Reasoning with Pentominoes,"Task 1: Making Pieces 1. Justifying that a generated set of examples is complete. Prior to our lesson, students were largely unfamiliar with pentominoes. Therefore, we began by describing the pieces as “geometric shapes constructed by adjoining five  unit squares edge to edge” (Golomb 1954). After a brief discussion of this definition, we distributed activity sheet 1, “Making Pieces,” and asked student pairs to construct as many distinct pentominoes as they could. As students shaded in grid squares, they recorded new shapes on a whiteboard at the front of the room. A sampling of these shapes is illustrated in figure 1. Providing time to construct possible pieces encouraged students to consider vocabulary such as “pentomino” and “distinct.” For instance, students correctly argued that the checkerboard shape in figure 1 (third in the first row) is not a pentomino because it contains “a square that shares no sides with the others.” As students shared their shapes, they also expressed concern about various shapes being “counted more than once.” As one student argued, “If you rotate this one [pointing to an L shape], it looks just like that one [pointing to a copy rotated 90 degrees]. They’re the same!” Soon others identified “nondistinct” pieces, paring down the list to 12 distinct pentominoes. We recorded these in “final draft” form on activity sheet 1, assigning a “look-alike” letter to each piece for easy reference, as illustrated in figure 2.",8,Nurturing Argumentation and Reasoning with Pentominoes
9,Nurturing Argumentation and Reasoning with Pentominoes,"A natural question to ask at this  point is, “How do we know the set is complete?” Providing a mathematical argument for this question proved difficult for students. Arguing beyond “We can’t think of any more” or “We can’t draw any more” was challenging. Although students observed some relationships among the pieces (for instance, some noticed that “the L pentomino is like the Y pentomino but with one block moved up two spaces”), the students did not make much headway in coming up with more systematic arguments about possible configurations. (See Parsons [2014] for an argument that begins by building all shapes from 2 unit squares [dominoes], then 3 unit squares [triominoes] by adding squares to the dominoes, then 4 unit squares [tetrominoes], and finally building all 12 pentominoes inductively.) 2. and 3. Confirming and refuting conjectures. To engage students in making conjectures and in arguments related to proportional reasoning, we asked them to record the area and perimeter of each piece and look for patterns. Although the area of each pentomino is, obviously, 5 square units, it was interesting to observe arguments that students made to support this assertion. Measuring the area of each pentomino and getting 5 each time (proof by exhaustion) is an acceptable argument; however, more impressive was the more abstract argument that pentominoes, by their definition, consist of 5 unit squares, and, thus, there is no need to measure anything. For the perimeter, many students hypothesized that each pentomino had a perimeter of 12 units on the basis of a limited number of cases. Other students pointed out that the P pentomino has a perimeter of 10 units. This argument became the basis for a discussion of counterexample as a tool of mathematical argument. An interesting extension task in this case ",9,Nurturing Argumentation and Reasoning with Pentominoes

12,Nurturing Argumentation and Reasoning with Pentominoes,"is to make an argument about what is different about the P shape that results in it having a different perimeter (see, for instance, Malloy [1999] and her discussion of Van Hiele levels with respect to area and perimeter).",12,Nurturing Argumentation and Reasoning with Pentominoes
13,Nurturing Argumentation and Reasoning with Pentominoes,"Task 2: Constructing Doubled Shapes 4. When an object is enlarged, what area and perimeter relationships exist between the smaller object and larger object? The development of a robust understanding of proportional relationships and reasoning is one of the most important ideas—if not the hallmark topic—of middle school mathematics (Behr et al. 1992). Students need opportunities to think about and make arguments regarding relationships between transformed and original objects. For instance,  what is the relationship between their area and their perimeter? What relationship do these measures have with regard to scale factor? Can copies of the smaller object be used to completely fill (i.e., “reptile”) the larger object? (Gardner 2001). ",13,Nurturing Argumentation and Reasoning with Pentominoes
14,Nurturing Argumentation and Reasoning with Pentominoes,"After identifying the 12 pentominoes and exploring the perimeter and area of each, we distributed preassembled plastic sets and a link to online grid paper for students to record findings. First, we asked them to find the area and perimeter of doubled shapes and make an argument about how many pieces were required. Several argument paths were possible. For instance, some students used the outline of the larger figure to calculate the area as 20 square units and then argued that covering 20 square units required  4 pentominoes. On the other hand, several students used scale factor to make higher-order arguments, noting that “the new area is the old area multiplied by the scale factor squared” (i.e., 5 × 22 = 5 × 4, so 4 pieces each with an area of 5 are needed to make the larger figure). Similar arguments could be made for the perimeters of the enlarged shapes compared with the original shapes.",14,Nurturing Argumentation and Reasoning with Pentominoes
15,Nurturing Argumentation and Reasoning with Pentominoes,"5. When an object is enlarged, what pieces completely fill it? Next, we  challenged students to select a pentomino and then use the remaining pieces to construct a “doubled” pentomino—one with each dimension two times longer than the original  (Hollingsworth 1985) (see activity sheet 2, “Enlarged Pentominoes,” for details). Students were initially provided with C and doubled C shapes, side by side, as shown in figure 3; then they were asked to find other enlargements of C that use different pieces.",15,Nurturing Argumentation and Reasoning with Pentominoes
16,Nurturing Argumentation and Reasoning with Pentominoes,Fig. 3 A C-shaped pentomino is shown with its duplicate built from 4 pieces.,16,Nurturing Argumentation and Reasoning with Pentominoes
17,Nurturing Argumentation and Reasoning with Pentominoes,"Note that the enlargement depicted in figure 3, right, does not include the original C shape. This led to some interesting questions: Is it possible to construct enlargements of each of the 12 pentominoes without the piece itself? Are there any pieces that can be enlarged using the original piece exclusively? Can we construct a doubled “letter C” using 4 letter Cs? Students employed different types of arguments to address such questions.",17,Nurturing Argumentation and Reasoning with Pentominoes
18,Nurturing Argumentation and Reasoning with Pentominoes,"Although we told students  that scaled versions of two of the pentomino pieces could not be constructed with 4 pieces, we did not reveal which they were. When we asked students to predict (and justify) which shapes could not be duplicated, responses that discussed dimensions of enlarged pieces and “stranded” squares were not unusual. An example explanation, which illustrated a “confirming conjecture” argument, is provided in figure 4. ",18,Nurturing Argumentation and Reasoning with Pentominoes
19,Nurturing Argumentation and Reasoning with Pentominoes,We asked students to construct a  duplicate of one or more pentominoes using precisely 4 pieces (excluding the piece to be enlarged). We verified—through proof by exhaustion— that doubled versions of 10 of the 12 pentominoes could be constructed without the original piece. Figure 5 summarizes student findings.,19,Nurturing Argumentation and Reasoning with Pentominoes

24,Nurturing Argumentation and Reasoning with Pentominoes,"Perhaps the most distinctive quality of mathematics is the use of logical reasoning to persuade others via argumentation that statements must be true. Recently, there has been positive reform to make mathematical argumentation a central driver of the curriculum and not just the purview of geometric proof in high school. The activities here show that when the focus of a task is on argumentation and when the content of the task allows for exploration of rich questions, middle school students can be guided to higher-order thinking and some sophisticated mathematical arguments.",24,Nurturing Argumentation and Reasoning with Pentominoes
