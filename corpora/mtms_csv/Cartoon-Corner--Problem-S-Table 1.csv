She answers, “3 children. The product of their ages equals 72, and the sum of all the ages is the same number as my house number.” The census taker looks at the house number and says, “This is not enough information.” The woman states, “My oldest child is a Chicago Cubs fan.” The census taker thanks the woman and leaves because he now knows the answer. What are the ages of her 3 children?",1,Cartoon Corner: Problem-Solving Perseverance Pays Off

11,Cartoon Corner: Problem-Solving Perseverance Pays Off,"My sixth-grade prealgebra students began this activity by reading aloud the various frames from the Jump Start cartoon. They could relate to the dreaded long division problems, although both classes reacted to the hand calculations differently. One class moaned and groaned, whereas the other class was totally focused. They agreed that sticking with a problem takes perseverance and emphasized that they felt they would eventually get an answer. We discussed the fact that learning occurs when you have to struggle with information. Students who solved it first thought they had earned bragging rights, and they talked about how  good it felt to accomplish the task.",11,Cartoon Corner: Problem-Solving Perseverance Pays Off
12,Cartoon Corner: Problem-Solving Perseverance Pays Off,"I challenged students to pick one of the last three problems to tackle. This allowed them some choice in the activity and incentive to finish one problem “first” in a competitive atmosphere. Most students chose the river crossing problem and had little difficulty. Students who initially left the goat with the cabbage or wolf were reminded that one would be eaten and that they needed to rethink their strategy. Students drew pictures to solve both the river crossing and the water jug problem. To move on to another problem, they had to verbally explain their solution. The last problem was always selected last. When I asked students why it was chosen last,  back with him. He leaves the goat on the original side and crosses with the cabbage. He leaves the cabbage with the wolf, returns alone, and crosses a final time with the goat. (Another similar solution can be found by switching the cabbage and the wolf.)  5.  The ages are 3, 3, and 8. Start with a list of all possible three-number sets whose product is 72: (1, 1, 72), (1, 2, 36), (1, 3, 24), (1, 4, 18), (1, 6, 12), (1, 8, 9), (2, 2, 18), (2, 3, 12), (2, 4, 9), (2, 6, 6), (3, 3, 8), (3, 4, 6)   Next, calculate the sum of the ages. Only two triples have the same sum: 2, 6, 6 and 3, 3, 8. The census taker knew the ages had to be one of those possibilities, but more information was still needed. The final hint told the census taker that there is an oldest child, which means this is the only child this age. The census taker then knew that the ages had to be 3, 3, and 8.  they responded that it was long. Although the Chicago Cubs clue baffled them for a while, it provided a spirited conversation on logical reasoning.",12,Cartoon Corner: Problem-Solving Perseverance Pays Off

17,Cartoon Corner: Problem-Solving Perseverance Pays Off,Students in my math 8 and algebrageometry 1 classes were easily engaged in this learning activity. All my students have had recent experience with converting fractions to decimals and converting both terminating and  repeating decimals to fractions using equations. The limitation of the number of digits displayed by their calculators is a familiar frustration. Students began eagerly using their calculators to complete the traditional long division algorithm to reveal the full repeating decimal block for 1/19.,17,Cartoon Corner: Problem-Solving Perseverance Pays Off
18,Cartoon Corner: Problem-Solving Perseverance Pays Off,"Students worked in pairs to solve  the problems. The wolf, goat, and cabbage problem sparked animated discussions, as did the water jug problem. Students sought clarifi cation about whether they could mark the jugs, so I made sure to let them know that the solution to the problem was possible with the jugs remaining unmarked. Problem 5 was the most diffi cult because my students were convinced that there was some hidden numerical code embedded within the reference to the Chicago Cubs.",18,Cartoon Corner: Problem-Solving Perseverance Pays Off
19,Cartoon Corner: Problem-Solving Perseverance Pays Off,"Our class discussions about  perseverance were enlightening. The fi rst time I asked students to defi ne “perseverance” was at the beginning of the school year. Contexts posited by students as examples of perseverance in the real world included researching cures for diseases; training puppies; learning to cook; achieving profi ciency in athletics, music, and visual and dramatic arts; and parenting children.

20,Cartoon Corner: Problem-Solving Perseverance Pays Off,"An extension related to problem 1 is for students to work together to generate the repeating decimal blocks for 2/19 through 18/19. Technology can assist with this process, but students should be cautioned that spreadsheets might not allow the full repeating block to be displayed. Students could then put the results for their group on poster paper (formatted with a grid) in descending numerical order, beginning with the equivalent of 1/19. Each group can analyze the patterns within and between the repeating decimal blocks. Deborah Regal Coller",20,Cartoon Corner: Problem-Solving Perseverance Pays Off

23,Cartoon Corner: Problem-Solving Perseverance Pays Off,"Problem 1 was interesting. It was hard to convince students that decimals do not end, even when the calculator display does end. A couple of my eighth-grade girls volunteered to do the division on the white board. One of my students had a Casio® calculator that showed the entire repeating decimal, even displaying the line above the repeating portion! Problem 1 was a good segue to problems 3 –5, when perseverance is absolutely necessary. I let students work in groups of 1, 2, or 3 on problems 3, 4, and 5.

27,Cartoon Corner: Problem-Solving Perseverance Pays Off,"My eighth-grade algebra students completed this activity on the last day of the marking period. This was an opportunity to do something different that would stretch their brains. As we acted out the cartoon and started the follow-up discussion, I realized that this activity would take more time than I had allotted. Everybody had an opinion. Many took exception to the panel about the nurse. They recalled an earlier visit from a nurse who said that medical personnel do not rely solely on technology; they often double-check readings by hand.

28,Cartoon Corner: Problem-Solving Perseverance Pays Off,"Earlier in the year, we had discussed the value of using fraction form over decimal form for precision, particularly when distributing. Fourths, fi fths, and other terminating decimals seemed doable and practical to them. Repeating decimals were more problematic. They would often stop dividing too soon when working with a fraction such as 1/7. They  found it hard to believe that they had to fi nd a six-digit repetend. Before starting problem 1, I told them that the repetend would be longer than six digits and asked them to estimate the number of digits. We did the calculations by hand fi rst. Everyone wanted to give up and use a calculator, but we saw it through. Seguing into problem 2, we extended the discussion into persevering in all aspects of life.

29,Cartoon Corner: Problem-Solving Perseverance Pays Off,"For the nonroutine items, I elected to start with problem 5. The students took the lead on this discussion and had no diffi culty generating the triples for the fi rst step. The second step posed more of a challenge. Not everyone realized that they were looking for two triples with the same sum, thus creating the necessity of a third clue. Even the use of the superlative in the third clue needed clarifi cation for some. ",29,Cartoon Corner: Problem-Solving Perseverance Pays Off
