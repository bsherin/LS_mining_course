"We  haVe  dedicated  this  fOcus  issue  Of  MTMS  tO  sharing ways that middle school teachers of mathematics are integrating the arts in their classes. in the broadest sense, this integration can help students build a fundamental understanding of and appreciation for both mathematics and the arts.  the arts provide a different way of experiencing mathematics, which can increase and deepen learning. investigations based in music, paintings, sculpture, or other art forms allow students to discover and think about mathematical concepts in new ways. since middle schoolers are often motivated  to  ask  questions  after  experiencing  the sensory  characteristics  of  an  art  form,  this problem solving can lead to the discovery of powerful mathematical ideas. applying mathematical concepts can then lead to the creation of various forms of art and help students connect  broader  meanings  to  those  concepts.  By engaging  students  in  purposeful  explorations that combine mathematics and the arts, teachers can bring the world into the classroom. the late claudia Zaslavsky helped many of us realize that the  mathematics  curriculum  can  and  should promote  the  sharing  of  cultural  knowledge and encourage respect among students for one another as well as for the peoples of the world. teaching mathematics through the  arts  provides  rich  resources  for  this sharing.  the articles in this focus issue illustrate how a variety of topics in mathematics can be taught through the arts to create powerful, coherent mathematics lessons that engage middle-grades students in learning.",2,mtms2007-04-419a,,
"in “teaching Mathematics through  the  art  of  Kolam,”  art  provides  the  basis for  an  investigation  involving  simple  graph theory  and  euler  paths  and  circuits—topics not  often  addressed  in  middle  school  classrooms. syamala chenulu describes how she used  kolam,  a  traditional  art  of  southern india, to launch an investigation of graph theory that moves from finding numerical and growing patterns to symmetry while asking students to formulate and test conjectures and verify their conclusions.

"Why wouldn’t a quadratic square pattern emerge  in  weaving?  as  Linda  Bolte  demonstrates  in  “Weaving  plaids  Based  on  (a  ±  b)2,” students expand the expression (a  +  b)2, choose  their yarn colors, and then watch their square pattern emerge as they weave. Most middle-grades students love their music. rita Barger and Martha haehl use that affinity to motivate their students to learn about the ratios and proportions needed to create music on stringed instruments in “Guitars, Violins, and Geometric sequences.”",4,mtms2007-04-419a,,
"Linear equations take on new meaning when students can visualize them in “connecting the Mobiles of alexander  calder  to  Linear  equations”  by  david  hedin. students learn about the artist in addition to creating mobiles of their own, “seeing” the equal sign as the balancing point of the mobiles as well as in equations.",5,mtms2007-04-419a,,
"in  both  “Just  five  does  it:  using  five Numbers  to  Make  patterned  squares”  by Margaret  Kenney  and  stanley  Bezuszka and  “irrational  Numbers  can  ‘in-spiral’ You”  by  Leslie  Lewis,  students  use number patterns to create artwork with  two  very  different  outcomes. We encourage you to see whether you can predict the kind of art that emerges as you read through these articles.",6,mtms2007-04-419a,,
"in  addition,  we  have  included  a  reprint  of  a  1974  Mathematics Teacher  article,  “Master  of  tessellations: M. c. escher, 1898–1972, ” as a part of the  MT  100  celebration.  the  reprint  is  followed by information from Jill Britton about ways that teachers can use escher’s work in their classes.  finally, several of our departments have features  that  relate  to  the  arts  as  well. “short takes: the Mathematics of radial designs” by Gretchen Wilkes begins an art unit by viewing and discussing mandalas created in tibet. “cartoon corner: advanced paint by Numbers” deals with topics in number theory. in “Math roots,” daniel  Jarvis  discusses  the  ancient  connection between mathematics and the visual arts in the form of the golden ratio.

We hope that the creative ideas and interdisciplinary activities discussed in this focus issue will inspire you to incorporate the arts into your mathematics instruction. ,8,mtms2007-04-419a,,
