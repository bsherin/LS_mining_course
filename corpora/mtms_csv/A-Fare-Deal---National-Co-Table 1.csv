0,A Fare Deal - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Ohanna, a seventh grader who lives in New York City, regularly takes the bus to get around the city. Ohanna pays $2.50 per bus ride when using her MetroCard. She earns a 5% bonus when she refills the card with a minimum of $5.00. For example, if she adds $10.00 on her MetroCard, her balance would actually be $10.50 because $10.00 + $0.50 (5% bonus) = $10.50.",,
1,A Fare Deal - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"However, on March 22, 2015, the New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) announced an increase, as shown in the table.",,

3,A Fare Deal - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,These changes will require Ohanna to analyze her trip costs:,,
4,A Fare Deal - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"1. Before she considers the $0.25 fare increase, how much will a single trip actually cost when she factors in the bonus she earns after refilling her MetroCard?",,
5,A Fare Deal - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"2. After she considers the MTA fare increase, how much will a single bus trip actually cost when she earns a bonus for refilling her card?",,
6,A Fare Deal - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"3. On the basis of the answers to (1) and (2), does the base fare really increase $0.25 or is it actually less than $0.25?",,
7,A Fare Deal - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"4. Although MTA does not typically refund the remaining balance on a MetroCard, it does allow riders to refill their cards with increments of $0.05, so that riders can use the remaining balance. For example, when Ohanna puts $10.00 on her Metrocard, she earns an 11% bonus (or an additional $1.10 with her $10 refill) and can then refill the card later in $0.05 increments so that she is able to use the remaining balance.",,
8,A Fare Deal - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"a. How much money did Ohanna put on her card if after she earned an 11% bonus, she now has $24.75 to spend?",,
9,A Fare Deal - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,b. Is your answer to (a) reasonable if the vending machine only accepts increments of $0.05?,,
10,A Fare Deal - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"c. If yes, then how many times could Ohanna ride the bus if there is $24.75 on her fare card?",,
