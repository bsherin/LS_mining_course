"This book of blackline masters gives middle level teachers a supplemental resource. The activities reinforce such topics as integers, variables, fractions, and probability. As students solve various problems, their answers generate coordinate values. Graphing these coordinates results in a picture, such as a frog or a kite. Some graphs require the use of all four quadrants; others use only the first quadrant.",2,mtms2011-08-62a,,
"Coordinate Graphing is an inexpensive way to incorporate additional practice into your daily lessons. The book has fifty-six different activities, each of which offers ten practice problems and a graphing activity. The publisher aligns each activity to standards and benchmarks from Mid-continent Research for Education and Learning.",3,mtms2011-08-62a,,
"Students may be frustrated by the  graphing activities, because one incorrect answer can change the entire  picture. Another drawback is the lack of creative design on the page. Lacking pictures or creative fonts, the ",4,mtms2011-08-62a,,

"What should parents do when  their child’s standardized test scores indicate that he or she has scored at or above the ninety-fifth percentile for his or her grade level? Chapter 3 presents a concise inventory of the variety of assessments available to further home in on a child’s capabilities, including a thorough treatment of the difference between ability, aptitude, and achievement tests. The Diagnostic Testing® Prescriptive Instruction (DT® PI) plan outlines   a solution for interpreting test results and translating them into an individual learning program. ",10,mtms2011-08-62a,,
"Do not mistake this book for an  insider’s guide to getting ahead in math: It is explicitly a guide for parents, teachers, and administrators who are in a position to serve the complex needs of mathematically gifted students. This book is also not a guide for improving instruction in mathematics and does not outline a particular curriculum for gifted students. However, the authors clearly recommend content acceleration over enrichment for exceptionally gifted students. ",11,mtms2011-08-62a,,
"Although Developing Math Talent may not conform to the philosophies of every reader, the authors make a strong case for their recommendations and provide extensive counsel for those who wish to advocate for acceleration. Finally, the case studies provide a window into parents’ poignant, often heartbreaking, struggles to meet the needs of their highly gifted children.  —Kimberly Morrow Leong Loudoun County Public Schools, Ashburn, Virginia",12,mtms2011-08-62a,,

"Each activity includes a grid showing the mathematical content areas. For some resources, the mathematical ideas are explicitly stated. For example, students explore exponential growth patterns taken directly from the Indian folktale Munna and the Grain of Rice. In the story, Munna asks for one grain of rice on the fi rst day of the month, then doubles his request each subsequent day for one month. ",16,mtms2011-08-62a,,
