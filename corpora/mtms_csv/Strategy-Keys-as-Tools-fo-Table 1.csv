However, when dealing with mathematical problems, we encounter a wide variety of diffi culties. Depending on the complexity of the task itself and the task formulation, students might not comprehend the problem at fi rst (Prediger and Krägeloh 2015).

In this case, problem-solving heuristics could help overcome these barriers (Schoenfeld 1985; 1992), but they do not guarantee success in problem solving. We refer to heuristics as strategies that students can implement when working on a problem, including all “mental operations typically useful for the solution of problems” (Pólya 1945, p. 2). However, students might not know which heuristics to implement (English and Sriraman 2010; Lesh and Zawojewski 2007). ",9,Strategy Keys as Tools for Problem Solving

To face these questions and to foster students’ problem-solving skills, we developed strategy keys (see fig. 1). ",10,Strategy Keys as Tools for Problem Solving

15,Strategy Keys as Tools for Problem Solving,"Strategy keys are cards in the shape of keys. On each key is written one general heuristic. To give each heuristic an individual “face,” we provide a different key shape for each key and a matching illustration. Also, the wording of each heuristic is formulated to be as simple as possible to avoid diffi culties in encoding each key. Instead, students should see a key and associate something with it. This way, the keys prompt new ideas and allow more “opportunities for delving more deeply into understanding the mathematical structure of problems . . . , instead of simply seeking correct solutions” (NCTM 2014, p. 48).

The teacher asks for associations that the students have. Students can be asked, “What do you think the keys can be used for?

31,Strategy Keys as Tools for Problem Solving,"The presentation phase is the most important phase. Students are asked to write their solutions and their way of finding their solutions, including the keys that were used, on a poster, which is then presented to the class. In this phase, all students will see that different keys have been used in several situations. This phase is not about evaluating the key usage concerning a right-or-wrong attempt but much more about whether the key usage was helpful or not. It is about the many different possible solutions paths that we can take and about the keys that could open up such a path. ",31,Strategy Keys as Tools for Problem Solving

Theresa explained it rather simply: “I think there is a rule. We have to double and then add two.” Although the solution was explained in the wrong order, the students somehow got the correct result.

Whenever they got stuck, they took the set of keys and checked systematically if they had already used a key, if a key could potentially be helpful, or if a key would not help at all. This procedure helped students structure their  problem-solving process.

However, in two cases (thinking time and motivation) a nonmathematical  behavior occurred after using a strategy key. Nevertheless, in all cases the keys were used in a productive way. So if we, as teachers, ignore the fact that a student might use a key not only in expected but also in unexpected ways and, further, if we then ignore evaluating and judging if he or she has done it correctly (meaning the expected interpretation of the key), we can see that all the students went at least one step further in their solution process, which is much more than some of them would probably have done without the keys.

72,Strategy Keys as Tools for Problem Solving,HOW DO THE KEYS  INFLUENCE THE STUDENTS’ STRATEGY BEHAVIOR?,72,Strategy Keys as Tools for Problem Solving
73,Strategy Keys as Tools for Problem Solving,"Qualitatively, we observed that students worked on a problem, got stuck, and then used a key. But what happened to their strategy behavior after the key usage? In an analysis of the students’ behavior picking various solution strategies, we found five different scenarios after they used a strategy key: The students (1) generate a new strategy, (2) change the previous strategy, (3) refine the  previous strategy, (4) maintain the previous strategy, or (5) name the previously used strategy (Herold and Rott 2015; Herold-Blasius and Rott 2016; Herold-Blasius, Rott, and Leuders 2017). Each scenario is discussed below: •    Generate a new strategy: If a student reads a problem and cannot think of a way to start, he or she gets stuck right at the beginning of the process. In this case, the student could look at the keys and generate a first strategy, which could then be a starting point to solve the problem.",73,Strategy Keys as Tools for Problem Solving

76,Strategy Keys as Tools for Problem Solving,"He or she thinks of a number that could possibly be the amount of apples and would then pass all seven gates to check whether or not one apple remains. The student gets stuck and chooses the key Work backward. He or she changes the previous strategy to work backward, starting with one apple, adding one apple, and doubling it. In this way, the student uses a strategy after the key usage that has not been used before.  •  Refine the previous strategy:  ",76,Strategy Keys as Tools for Problem Solving
77,Strategy Keys as Tools for Problem Solving,"Richard (see fig. 3) generated  two examples and got stuck. He then chose the key Make a table, and he drew a table.

This way, he could write down his examples more systematically.",77,Strategy Keys as Tools for Problem Solving
78,Strategy Keys as Tools for Problem Solving,"•  Maintain the previous strategy: While working on the Farm problem, a student could generate several examples. However, he or she might not find the correct constellation and then gets stuck. Taking the set of keys and seeing Find an example might allow the student to say, “Oh right. That is  exactly what I am doing. I will just continue doing this because the key says so.” In this case, a student would choose a key, not change or refine anything, but maintain the previous strategy.  •  Name the previously used strategy:  Students name the strategies they used either in the process itself or after. The set of keys might become a tool to help students  formulate strategies more easily and to talk about the problemsolving process itself. ",78,Strategy Keys as Tools for Problem Solving
79,Strategy Keys as Tools for Problem Solving,"From our experience, students mostly change, refine, or name the previous strategy.

So far, five different strategy behaviors could be identified after using a strategy key: Generate a new strategy and change, refine, maintain, or name a previously used strategy.",81,Strategy Keys as Tools for Problem Solving
82,Strategy Keys as Tools for Problem Solving,"In other analyses, we identified six different ways of students’ interaction  with the keys: Do what is written on the key, change of mathematical perspective, naming of a strategy, thinking time, motivation, and use as a checklist. We did not expect this number of different interactions and teachers might not have either. ",82,Strategy Keys as Tools for Problem Solving
