"This is the fifth edition of a book first published in 1955. Its primary objective is to investigate  the  natural  numbers.  There are  twelve  chapters,  which  are  labeled 0  through  9  and  e  and  ℵ0.  Chapter  0  explains the history of that digit, and the special  properties  of  zero  are  enumerated. Chapter  1  documents  the  creation  of  the counting numbers and the importance of prime numbers. Chapters 2 though 9 use the single digit to extend into various numerical  topics.  Chapter  2  looks  at  the  binary system. Chapter 3 investigates prime numbers.  Chapter  4  delves  into  square numbers  and  the  Pythagorean  theorem. As  the  chapters  progress,  the  material tends to become more sophisticated—Fermat  numbers  are  discussed  in  chapter  7 and  modulo  systems  occur  in  chapter  9. Chapter e focuses on logarithms, whereas ",7,mtms2007-02-350a,,

"Many  discussions  will  be  useful  to  middle-grades  mathematics  teachers.  Examples include casting out nines, triangular numbers, and perfect numbers. This book should be in the library of every mathematics teacher, and university faculty who prepare students to teach mathematics should also own this book. Although some of the topics  may  be  difficult  to  comprehend, this is not a weakness, since the material might convince some readers to seek out a course in number theory to bolster their foundation in mathematics.",10,mtms2007-02-350a,,
"This  well-written  book  has  quiz  questions  at  the  end  of  each  chapter,  and  answers are provided. For those who teach algebraic factoring, show page 112 to your students and ask them to find the error.—",11,mtms2007-02-350a,,

"This  biographical  novel  weaves  narrative and history in presenting the life of one of the most significant mathematicians of the modern era. Stories that Gauss told about himself  and  that  historians  have  docu- mented,  as  well  as  his  major  mathematical  accomplishments,  are  presented  in  a form suitable for middle school students. Thus,  combining  the  narrative  with  the historical,  the  mathematician  Gauss  becomes  more  personalized  and  accessible for young readers.",15,mtms2007-02-350a,,
"The unfolding story of Gauss’s life—as a  child  prodigy,  student,  professor,  husband and father, public figure, and innovator—provides a context for the mathematics  and  discoveries  he  made  in  number theory,  conics,  astronomy,  non-Euclidean geometry,  topology,  and  magnetism.  Stories include how Gauss solved the problem of adding the first 100 counting numbers, calculated sums of infinite series from Zeno’s paradox, and proved that the square root of two is not a rational number. Other mathematicians discussed in the context of Gauss’s mathematical explorations include the  Pythagoreans,  Archimedes,  Newton, Leibniz,  Lambert,  Lagrange,  Mersenne, Fermat, and Euler. The account of Gauss’s friendship with fellow mathematician Wolfgang  Bolyai  describes  the  two  students exploring  some  fundamental  problems  of mathematics.",16,mtms2007-02-350a,,
"For teachers who value the impact that historical studies in mathematics can have on  their  students,  who  incorporate  literature  into  their  teaching,  or  who  want  to open up a world of mathematics often inaccessible to middle school students, this is an excellent source. The book is accessible to those students who read at a basic level  as well as advanced readers and students of mathematics. It is written by a teacher with  teaching  in  mind  who  has  provided the  story  of  a  life  and  who  has  brought to life the mathematics of the times.—M.

The names of the projects are interesting, and the pictures are great, although daunting. The book is geared toward middle school to high school students. The projects are interesting,  and  my  students  loved  them. ",21,mtms2007-02-350a,,

"Solving  Math  Problems  Kids  Care  About (grades 4–8) is a resource that offers a guide to problem solving, along with forty-four reproducible worksheets. This book has three sections:  Section  I:  Mathematical  Problem Solving  (What’s  Worth  Knowing,  Teaching Mathematical  Problem  Solving),  Section  II: Teaching  Strategies  for  Mathematical  Problem  Solving  (Whole-class  Problem  Solving Warm ups, Problems and Solutions), and Section III: Reproducible Problem Starters. It also provides tips for organizing the classroom and teaching problem-solving strategies.",26,mtms2007-02-350a,,
"Students  at  all  levels  can  find  success as mathematicians as well as members of a team while working through this book. The solutions are organized into four subsections including Understand the Problem, Select a Strategy, Carry Out the Strategy, and Evaluate  the  Results.  Each  problem  is  restated, then the task is broken down by facts, conditions, and the goal. Suggestions, diagrams and graphs, and examples are given for selecting and carrying out an appropriate strategy. After stating the final solution, Souviney presents  ideas  for  extending  the  problem, solving  similar  problems,  and  connecting the problem beyond the classroom. ",27,mtms2007-02-350a,,
"Although  the  title  implies  that  students would  care  about  these  problems,  I  found myself  questioning  whether  I  would  be tempted  by  these  problems  and  whether  I would want to have thirty students at a time working on them, especially the one about figuring out how many grains of rice are in a  bag  of  rice.  The  students  in  my  sixth-  to eighth-grade mathematics intervention class were more eager to engage in activities from this book than the students in my grade-level classes. That stated, I appreciate the experiential, hands-on nature of the problems. ",28,mtms2007-02-350a,,
"Souviney has gathered mathematics problems that would be appropriate for students in  fourth  to  sixth  grades,  as  extensions  for younger students, and as scaffolding for word problems  in  middle  school  mathematics  intervention classes. This book would also be a great resource for mathematics teachers who are  new  to  the  profession.—Elizabeth  Tyler, Discovery Lab School, Yakima, WA 98902. l",29,mtms2007-02-350a,,
