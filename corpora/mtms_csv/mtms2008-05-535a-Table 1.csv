"Using all the digits 0 through 9 once and only once, create multiples of 4 that will sum to the smallest number possible. An example is shown below.",3,mtms2008-05-535a,,
"9 once and only once. (However, the sum of 2736 is not the smallest number that is possible.)",4,mtms2008-05-535a,,
"Many students discussed a trial-anderror method for solving the task.  David, a seventh-grade student in Lynda Asher’s mathematics class at  A. C. Steele Middle School in Calabasa, California, explained how he listed multiples of 4, found a solution, and moved digits around to get a smaller sum while still meeting the conditions of the problem (see fig. 1).  1472 + 956 + 308 = 2736",5,mtms2008-05-535a,,

"Jason, another student in Asher’s class, had a more systematic process for finding the smallest sum (see fig. 2). He stated that using the odd digits was challenging but that knowing the divisibility rule for 4 made the task easier.",10,mtms2008-05-535a,,
"Pamela, a sixth-grade student in Bonnie King’s mathematics class at Lincoln-Roosevelt School in Succasunna, New Jersey, provided a detailed process for finding her solution (see  fig. 3). She discussed using the largest odd digits in the tens place to keep the sum small and placing the other odd digits in front of multiples of 4. Richard, also a student in Asher’s mathematics class, provided another detailed process for finding a solution. In figure 4, a portion of the explanation is provided. He explained ideas to consider when trying to minimize the sum of the multiples of 4 and the limitations to having only one-digit or two-digit multiples of 4 being used for the sum. All these students were successful in  finding a solution to the task. Various combinations of multiples of 4 meet the conditions and lead to the same sum. Figure 5 shows examples of solutions sent by Margaret Meyer’s seventh-grade students from Auburn Middle School in Auburn, Maine. Meyer reported students stating they learned about multiples of 4 being even; that multiples of 4 ending in 0, 4, and 8 were preceded by an even number (e.g., 124 is 4 preceded by 12), whereas multiples of 4 ending in 2 and 6 were preceded by an odd number (e.g., 136 is 6 preceded by 13).",11,mtms2008-05-535a,,

"Fig. 3 Pamela’s steps to solving the task 1. The first step I did was to list all of the multiples of four up to 96. I stopped there because I only wanted to look at two-digit numbers. When I wrote them I wrote them in their number groups (ex: 12, 16 are together and 20, 24, 28 are also together).  2. I eliminated numbers that used the same digit twice (ex: 44 there are two fours).",13,mtms2008-05-535a,,
"3. I looked at the odd numbers in the ten’s column, because they all share 2s and 6s as the last digit.",14,mtms2008-05-535a,,
4. I decided to use the largest odd digits in the tens column so that they wouldn’t make the total larger than it needs to be. I used 72 and 96.,15,mtms2008-05-535a,,
5. I then had to add the other odd numbers in front of the 72 and 96 because odd numbers are not divisible by 4. The numbers I came up with were 372 and 596.,16,mtms2008-05-535a,,
"6. I still had to use the 0, 4, 1, and 8.",17,mtms2008-05-535a,,
7. There is no combination using the 1 in the ten’s or one’s column so I had to put it in the hundred’s column. The number turned out to the 104.,18,mtms2008-05-535a,,
"8. I only had the 8 left and it is a multiple of 4. I then added them all together and got 1,080!",19,mtms2008-05-535a,,
"My Numbers:     104     396     592   +    8                       1,080  ",20,mtms2008-05-535a,,

"To minimize the sum of the numbers, we want the hundreds and thousands digit as small as possible and the ones and tens digit as large as possible. If we could have all single-digit numbers, this would be ideal but not possible. Neither is it possible to create five sets of two- digit numbers, as you would run out of even numbers because the one digit has to be two or six when the tens digit is odd if the number is divisible by four. Because of this, you would run out of even numbers. The same thing would happen if you used four two-digit numbers and two one-digit numbers. So if you were to do this, the maximum digits can’t be two but how about three? One of your numbers can have four digits but the sum would not be much smaller than the example’s 2736. ",22,mtms2008-05-535a,,
"A task like this can help build  number sense by having students think about place value, multiples of number, and the size of numbers. The task can be altered to provide additional challenges. Instead of using multiples of 4, multiples of 3 or 8 could be computed. You could require students to use only perfect squares, cubes, or prime numbers. You could also look at other operations and find the smallest product or largest quotient. All these alternative tasks can promote students’ number sense.",23,mtms2008-05-535a,,
