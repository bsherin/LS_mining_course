"However, to be competitive, high school students need four years of mathematics, including calculus. In other words, your child must begin algebra in the eighth grade so that calculus can be taken in the twelfth grade. ",17,mtms2009-09-68a,,
"The implication of this statement is that if calculus is not taken in grade 12, the student will not be competitive in a college or university.",18,mtms2009-09-68a,,
"I have been involved in mathematics education for fifty years as a middle school and high school math teacher, state math supervisor, associate director of the State Math Coalitions Project at MSEB, and director of a Professional Development Project for Mathematics and Science Teachers. I have had the opportunity to interact with colleagues at all levels throughout the country from K−12 through university and to discuss and study the issue of university entrance requirements. After reading this article, I did a random check of entrance requirements of universities around the country, including the California state university system. I found very few that required four years of mathematics. The major-",19,mtms2009-09-68a,,

"Differing with the author’s state- ments, I would argue that more students enter four-year colleges and universities without having taken calculus. I would also argue that more college graduates enter without calculus than those who do. Therefore, I believe the suggestion that “your child must begin algebra in the eighth grade so that calculus can be taken in the twelfth grade” is highly misleading.",22,mtms2009-09-68a,,
"In fairness to the author, I am well  aware that most universities require four years of mathematics for those students who plan to major in mathematics or science and that calculus is highly recommended. However, even in those cases, a student may be able to enter calculus having taken a precalculus course in high school.",23,mtms2009-09-68a,,

To fail to point out that the research simply does not support all the claims you make on the take-home page is not being fair to parents or middle school teachers. ,29,mtms2009-09-68a,,
"I have been a critic of the blanket  support of grade 8 algebra since at least 1985 when I wrote a column for Mathematics Teacher, titled “Let’s Not Teach Algebra to Eighth Graders!”  (November 1985, pp. 586−87). ",30,mtms2009-09-68a,,
"Can you support, for example, the claim that “high school students need four years of mathematics, including calculus” [emphasis added]? Surely that is not true in many circumstances, including at some reasonably competitive colleges. Four years, yes; including calculus in the four years, debatable. ",31,mtms2009-09-68a,,
Recent research that we completed in New Hampshire strongly supported four years of mathematics but failed to find that calculus was necessary.,32,mtms2009-09-68a,,
"I was dismayed by the paragraph that begins, “Many students experience gaps in . . . ” (p. 503, column 1). Why did that observation not lead to a word of caution about having those students pursue algebra rather than spend another year in middle school mathematics? ",33,mtms2009-09-68a,,
