"What If We  Were Built Like  the Dinosaurs? cCan you imagine having a three-foot- long neck? What if triangular plates covered your back? How would you like to have arms so short that you could not feed yourself? In this twopart activity, middle school students are given the chance to use mathematics and science to address these questions with an artistic flair. Using ratios, students design new “humans” with features that are proportional to those of the dinosaurs. They then explore the implications for humans if these new features became real body parts. The activity requires students to engage in proportional reasoning as they study paleontology. Students select a particular dinosaur and scale its distinct traits (e.g., unusually long necks, small heads, armored backs, short arms, or huge teeth) to their own body. In other words, they use proportions to determine actual body measurements from specific dinosaurs and determine how these characteristics would alter the shape of certain human characteristics. The dinosaurs featured are the apatosaurus, tyrannosaurus, and stegosaurus (see descriptions in figs. 1, 2, and 3) (Benton 1998; Carnegie Museum of Natural History 2006; Dewan 1994; Dixon 2000; Haslam 1996; University of Bristol 2006). According to the Principles and Standards for School Mathematics (NCTM 2000), the middle school curriculum should address foundational ideas such as proportionality. In addition, students need to “become proficient at . . . using ratio and proportion to solve problems involving scaling, similarity, and derived measures” (p. 241). Because proportional relationships are found within many everyday activities, such as doubling a recipe or determining gasoline requirements for a weekend road trip, helping students develop an understanding of this concept is important.  sarah Quebec Fuentes, SQuebec@aol.",2,mtms2007-11-249a,,

"This two-part activity takes approximately two hours to implement as part of a seventh-grade unit on proportions. The materials needed to complete the unit are activity sheets 1 and 2, tape measures or yardsticks, and pictures or models of the dinosaurs. In activity 1, students make a scale drawing of the human body; in activity 2, they draw humans using dinosaur proportions.",9,mtms2007-11-249a,,
"To draw the human body pro- portionally, artists think of humans as being approximately eight and one-half heads tall ( Jusko 2006). The other body parts are also measured in terms of number of heads, as shown in activity 1 and figure 4. In activity 1, students measure the length of their head in question 2. Then they use the length of their head and the artist’s model as a scale factor to estimate the measurements of their body parts for the “Calculated Measurement (in Inches)” column in the table (question 4 on activity 1). Real measurements of students’ body parts are listed in the “Actual Measurement (in Inches)” column and compared with the estimated measurements to assess the accuracy of the artist’s model of the human body. Finally, the artist’s measurements are used to make a scale drawing of the human body. ",10,mtms2007-11-249a,,

The blood pressure of a human-apatosaurus with a three-foot neck would need  to be higher so that blood could reach the brain. The body of a human-tyrannosaurus might not be able to support its large head. The plates down the spine of a humanstegosaurus could change how the body regulates temperature. A large brain (human-tyrannosaurus) or a small brain (human-apatosaurus and human-stegosaurus) might affect intelligence. Students are encouraged to imagine other potential changes in their biology and lifestyle.",13,mtms2007-11-249a,,

For example, the apatosaurus is very long, and has a long neck, a long tail, and a small head. The tyrannosaurus is tall, and has a large head, large teeth, and short arms. The stegosaurus has a small head and two rows of alternating plates down its back. ",14,mtms2007-11-249a,,
"Using key characteristics of each  dinosaur, students explore what humans would look like if they had these characteristics. They choose a dinosaur and determine how the measurements of human body parts would be altered if they looked more like the dinosaur. Once students have made these calculations, they make a scale drawing of a human with these characteristics, name their new “human,” present their scale drawings, and justify their new humans’ names to the class. Sample student drawings are illustrated in figures 5 and 6. Although the apatosaurus and stegosaurus are quadrupeds, only two of each of the dinosaurs’ characteristics are used to create the new “humans,” who remain bipeds.",15,mtms2007-11-249a,,
"To conclude the activity, students discuss potential problems with the characteristics of these new “humans” and the implications of the structural changes to the human body. For example, a humanapatosaurus with a very long neck would have difficulty entering ",16,mtms2007-11-249a,,

"By studying dinosaurs, middle school students are able to explore proportional relationships in an unusual way. While engaged in the activity, students practice taking measurements, converting measurements to other scales, and constructing scale drawings. The calculations used in solving the proportions allow them to discuss and compare the proportions of their own body and provide further practice in using and visualizing fractional and decimal proportions. ",19,mtms2007-11-249a,,
"Students are intrigued with the relationship between the length of their head compared with the lengths of other body parts, such as arms, legs, hands, and feet. Divergent measurements among classmates can lead to a discussion of why differences exist. Extending the activity to drawings of humans with dinosaur proportions encourages even the most reluctant student to become an artist.",20,mtms2007-11-249a,,
"This activity also opens the possibility for humorous discussions about the effects of a new dinosaur-like body on the daily life of a human. One student asked, “How  would we go to the bathroom with such short arms?” Another worried, “How will I reach my food and get it to my mouth?” Yet, the opportunity exists for more in-depth conversations concerning anatomy and physiology. By giving students an opportunity to explore a method that artists use to look at human proportions and drawing a transformed human shape, they are encouraged to use their imaginations. Through this activity, students are able to connect mathematics, art, and science and to appreciate the interrelationships of those disciplines.  solutions",21,mtms2007-11-249a,,
