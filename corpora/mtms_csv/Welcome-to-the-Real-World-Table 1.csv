7,Welcome to the Real World - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,3. You are calculating paychecks for the pay period after everyone received raises. The directorâ€™s former pay was $92 per hour before she got a 2% raise. The director worked a total of 71 hours this pay period. The employeeâ€™s starting pay was $41 per hour before he got a 3% raise. The employee worked 77 hours this pay period.,,
8,Welcome to the Real World - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,a. How much would the director have been paid without her raise?,,
9,Welcome to the Real World - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,b. How much more was the director paid with her raise?,,
10,Welcome to the Real World - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,c. How much would the employee have been paid before receiving the raise?,,
11,Welcome to the Real World - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,d. How much more was the employee paid with the raise?,,
12,Welcome to the Real World - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,e. How much more did the director get paid than the employee during this pay period?,,
13,Welcome to the Real World - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"4. You and a friend each begin jobs at different companies that pay $40,000 per year. You earn a 4% yearly raise at the end of each year for 3 years (compounded). Your friend earns a year-end bonus of $1,750 each year (not compounded).",,
14,Welcome to the Real World - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,a. How much will you earn during your first year? Your third year?,,
15,Welcome to the Real World - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"b. Over the 3-year period, what is the total amount that you will earn? What is the total amount that your friend will earn? Who will earn more? How much more?",,
16,Welcome to the Real World - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"c. Suppose your company continues its policy of annual raises and your friendâ€™s company continues with year-end bonuses. In the long run, who will likely earn more: You or your friend?",,
17,Welcome to the Real World - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,CHALLENGE,,
18,Welcome to the Real World - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"5. A boss is paid $100,000 per year and receives a 2% raise for next year. The employee is paid $60,000 per year. What percentage yearly raise does the employee need to receive for the boss and the employee to collect equal pay for next year?",,
19,Welcome to the Real World - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,SOLUTIONS,,
20,Welcome to the Real World - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Many of the questions in this Cartoon Corner were created by Taylor Fuller, Codie Manson, Jessie Newcomer, and Jill Tucker at Capital University, Columbus, Ohio.",,
21,Welcome to the Real World - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"1. A boss usually earns more money than an employee, so a 2 percent increase for the boss is likely greater than a 3 percent increase for the employee. Sample solution: Suppose the boss earns $80,000.00 per year, and the employee earns $40,000.00 per year. A 2 percent increase for the boss would be 0.02 â€¢ $80,000.00, or $1,600.00. A 3 percent increase for the employee would be 0.03 â€¢ $40,000.00, or $1,200.00. In this example, the bossâ€™s salary increases by $400.00 more than the employeeâ€™s.",,
22,Welcome to the Real World - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"2.a. $72.00 â€¢ 8 = $576.00; $33.00 â€¢ 8 = $264.00. In 8 hours, the boss earns $576.00 â€“ $264.00, or $312.00 more than the employee.",,
23,Welcome to the Real World - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,b. New hourly rate for the boss at 102 percent of the previous hourly rate: $72.00 â€¢ 1.02 = $73.44. The new hourly rate for the employee at 103 percent of the previous hourly rate: $33.00 â€¢ 1.03 = $33.99.,,
24,Welcome to the Real World - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"c. After the raises, for 8 hours, the boss will earn 8 â€¢ $73.44, or $587.52, and the employee will earn 8 â€¢ $33.99, or $271.92. The boss will earn $587.52 â€“ $271.92, or $315.60 more. Before the raises, for 8 hours, the boss earned $576.00 â€“ $264.00, or $312.00, more than the employee. The new difference in pay for 8 hours is $315.60 â€“ $312.00, or $3.60 more for the boss than before.",,

43,Welcome to the Real World - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"c. Answers will vary. Sample solution: In the long run, you are likely to do better at your company than your friend. If the raises and bonuses continue at the same rates, your increase with a 4 percent raise beginning with year 5 would be about $1,800.00 (4th year: $43,264.00 â€¢ 1.04 = $44,994.56; 5th year: $44,994.56 â€¢ 1.04 â‰ˆ $46,794.34, representing close to an $1,800.00 increase)â€”which is greater than the $1,750.00 bonus your friend would receive. More important, your yearly salary is steadily increasing, whereas your friendâ€™s salary is remaining constant.",,

50,Welcome to the Real World - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,x = 1.70,,
51,Welcome to the Real World - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"This means that $102,000.00 is 170 percent of $60,000.00. The $60,000 would have to be increased by 70 percent to equal $102,000.00. Check your work: $60,000.00 â€¢ 1.7 = $102,000.00. This total matches the bossâ€™s salary after the 2 percent increase in that salary.",,
52,Welcome to the Real World - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,FIELD-TEST COMMENTS,,
53,Welcome to the Real World - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I used this cartoon with a seventh-grade class at the end of January, which is the end of our first semester. The topics of percentages had been studied before the holiday break. I gave this cartoon to my students as a way to review percentages before the semester test. The students first worked individually for twenty to twenty-five minutes; then, they were allowed to collaborate at their table groups. Students did not use calculators.",,
54,Welcome to the Real World - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The students did well and knew exactly what to do to solve all the problems. There were a few computational errors, but they completely understood the concepts. Two students answered the challenge correctly. Others attempted it but either did not complete it or answered incorrectly.",,
55,Welcome to the Real World - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I was very pleased at how much the students remembered from our earlier lessons and how well they answered these questions. I emphasized in our percentages unit that this was as â€œreal-world mathâ€ as it gets. We have worked through a lot of examples from shopping, saving money, owing money, and salaries. Because it was easy to make percentages relate to money, the students enjoyed these studies.",,

59,Welcome to the Real World - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,I used this cartoon with my seventh-grade prealgebra class. The students were able to quickly do all of the problems without any input from me. I assigned this cartoon prior to the unit on applying percentages. The cartoon helped students understand the difference between compound interest and simple interest.,,
60,Welcome to the Real World - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"This would be a nice cartoon to use when you want students to work independently. Before beginning, they would need to have an understanding of converting a percentage to a decimal, and how to calculate the percentage of a number.",,

Throughout the year, they learned about school and car loans, mortgages, paychecks and the taxes associated with them, investments, and the random events that financially impact adults.",,
65,Welcome to the Real World - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,The concept of 2 percent of a paycheck being greater than 3 percent of someone elseâ€™s paycheck was easily explained by the class with a variety of scenarios. Compounded interest was a new term introduced with this cartoon. We calculated each yearâ€™s salary and compared it with the person receiving a yearly bonus. Students discussed their selected career and debated which was a more likely (as well as preferred) income that they might expect. Everyone agreed that a yearly percentage increase was the best deal in the long run.,,
