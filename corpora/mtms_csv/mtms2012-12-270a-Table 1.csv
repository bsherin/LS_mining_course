There is a 1 in 21, or 1/21, chance to guess correctly; there are 20 chances out of 21, or 20/21, to guess incorrectly.    b.  Yes. With the clue, the probability of success is 1/21 (about 4.8%). This is greater than the probability of success without the clue (1/32, or about 3.1%). Another way to solve is to examine the probabilities of failure. With the clue, the probability of failure is 20/21 (about 95.2%); without the clue, the probability of failure is 31/32 (about 96.9%).",17,mtms2012-12-270a,,

"5.  a.  To fi nd the probability of two  successive events (known as the joint occurrence of two events), multiply the probability of the fi rst event by the probability of the second event.

"I used this cartoon activity with my seventh-grade prealgebra students during a unit on probability. They had already been introduced to the concepts of probability and odds, so I used the cartoon to reinforce the concepts. I wanted everyone to complete the challenge question, so I rewrote the problem, writing out all the problem numbers and giving students space to answer each. I also changed questions 4 and 5 to reflect the number of desks in my classroom.",32,mtms2012-12-270a,,
"I really appreciated the multiple  parts of the questions that enabled my students to see the differences between their answers: the probability of guessing correctly versus incorrectly, simple versus compound probability, and the probabilities versus odds. ",33,mtms2012-12-270a,,

"I used this lesson at the end of the school year with two different groups. The eighth-grade algebra class completed it during a probability unit. The seventh-grade class used it as an en- richment lesson. The cartoon immediately elicited some spontaneous reactions, from “Oh, I get it!” to laughter. Quite a bit of discussion occurred for the first question; some felt it was absolutely certain, given human nature; others could not tell because less than one-half the desks were visible. Most of my students relied on gut instinct instead of the mathematical application of probability rules. We worked through all the questions together. Someone asked about the difference between probability and odds. Since most of the questions involved the probability of incorrect as well as correct choices, I built the “Challenge” question into our discussion of each. Question 5 required some background  teaching. Students who had not previously worked with such items wanted to know why the two ratios were multiplied. We created tree-diagram scenarios to illustrate the concept. ",35,mtms2012-12-270a,,
Students have a natural interest in this topic. All too often we wait until the end of the year to teach it. I will use this activity to introduce probability before back-to-school night to motivate some to straighten their desks for “company.” I can then reinforce the concept during the rest of the year.,36,mtms2012-12-270a,,
