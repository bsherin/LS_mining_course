"Developing strong number sense is critical in learning mathematics. Although many students are relatively comfortable working with whole numbers in elementary school, some may have a difficult time using and making sense of rational numbers when they enter middle school (Kilpatrick, Swafford, and Findell 2001). Many teachers report that students often struggle with the meanings and representations of rational numbers and composing and decomposing these numbers (Lamon 2007). For example, realizing that 4/5 of $1.00 is 80 cents (or $0.80) or that 0.495 is about 1/2 requires knowledge about notation, place value, meanings of the numerator and denominator, as well as referents found in everyday life.  sire to play well. Math games require that students think carefully about efficient strategies. Therefore, playing games that engage students in serious mathematical thinking will support their mathematical understanding. The games that we describe should help students— •	 understand	the	place-value	structure of our base-ten number system and use it to represent and compare whole numbers and decimals; and •	 recognize	multiple	representations	 for decimal numbers and generate equivalent expressions by decomposing and composing numbers (NCTM 2000, p. 214).

"The exploration this month uses  games adapted from those found in Investigations in Number, Data, and Space (TERC 2008) to support middle school students’ understanding of the base-ten number system and decimal numbers. Like Kamii and Anderson (2003), we believe that students take games seriously and de-",5,mtms2011-11-244a,,
"We have designed these games with the assumption that students have developed a prior understanding of whole numbers, fraction notation, and meanings of operations. However, students with a wide range of mathematical abilities, from those who are learning basic concepts of number and operations to those who are comfortable with decimals, can benefit. The games give students opportunities to develop meanings for decimals as they form connections among multiple decimal representations. In both games, students use two types of cards—numeral cards and placevalue cards—to form amounts. (See the diagrams of both cards on p. 251.) The numeral cards include landmark whole numbers as well as the fraction 1/2; they indicate the number of units to be considered. The place-value cards include terms from thousandths to thousands and make explicit the denominators that are implicit in decimal notation. The games require players to compose amounts from one numeral card and one place-value card, such as 20 hundredths from a 20 card and a hundredths card. In the first game, players shade the area that represents the value of amounts, such as two rows of boxes to represent 20 hundredths. In the second game, opponents compare the amounts that they each formed.",6,mtms2011-11-244a,,
"To give the reader a better idea of the kinds of thinking that students do while playing these games, we present brief descriptions of sample games. In the first game, we provide an example of student language and reasoning used during one turn. In the second game, we describe common student strategies and representations. Before reading further, we encourage you to go over the directions and play the games with a colleague (see activity sheets 1 and 2).",7,mtms2011-11-244a,,

"Students represent decimal fractions as part of an area, visualize decimal addition, and estimate sums of decimals while playing this game. Further, as students rename values and shade quantities, they begin to picture the base-ten structure of the number  system (i.e., 10 tenths is equal to 1;   1 tenth is equal to 10 hundredths). See activity sheet 1.",9,mtms2011-11-244a,,
"Because the object of the game is to shade as close as possible to two  10 × 10 grids, it is critical that students understand that in the context of this game one 10 × 10 grid represents 1 whole and that on each turn they select cards that allow them to shade the largest available fraction of their grid. We created figure 1 to show the first two turns in a typical game. On turn 1, for example, the player has two number cards (2, 50) and two place-value cards (tenths, thousandths) to choose from. Jacob’s comments exemplify the reasoning we have heard from middle school students who must determine which two cards to play. ",10,mtms2011-11-244a,,
"Well, 50 tenths is 5 whole grids; that’s too much. Let me think about 50 thousandths. I know that each little box is one-hundredth and there  are 10 one-thousandths in each  hundredth. So 50 thousandths is  5 hundredths or only 5 little boxes;  2 tenths is way more than that! So I’ll use 2 tenths. [The shading indicates that Jacob selected and removed the cards on his turn.]",11,mtms2011-11-244a,,
"Note that his reasoning and language are both based on his interpretation of the 10 × 10 grid representation, which we have found to be a helpful referent in tasks where students are renaming and comparing decimal numbers. For his second turn (fig. 1, turn 2), the cards he used are replaced with “1” and “thousandths.” Jacob chooses 50 thousandths, shades 5 small boxes, and records that amount below the grids (see fig. 1). With the options available in this turn  (1 thousandth vs. 50 thousandths), the reasoning is much more straightforward but not necessarily trivial  (see fig. 2).",12,mtms2011-11-244a,,

"As students represent amounts formed by their cards on 10 × 10 grids, they visualize those amounts and observe equivalences. For example, students can easily see on a  10 × 10 grid that 2 tenths is equivalent to 20 hundredths or that  1/2 of a tenth can be thought of as  5 hundredths. This kind of renaming allows students to think flexibly about the value of decimals and to build an understanding of our number system’s base-ten place-value structure.",17,mtms2011-11-244a,,

"In this game, each of two students draws a numeral card and a placevalue card to generate a fraction. The winner of the round is the student with the larger fraction. The main goals of having students play this game are to help them understand the base-ten structure of our numeration system; rename amounts (e.g., 20 hundredths is equal to 2 tenths); analyze the roles of both numerator (numeral card) and denominator (place-value card) in fractions; and develop comparison strategies. ",19,mtms2011-11-244a,,
"Students commonly pursue several strategies, as described below:  •	 Compare place-value cards when the  numeral cards are the same.  Example: 20 hundredths versus  20 tenths. There are 20 of each, but tenths are larger than hundredths, so 20 tenths is the larger amount. •	 Compare the numeral cards when the  place-value cards are the same.  Example: 10 tens versus 1/2 ten. Both are measuring the amount of tens; 10 is larger than 1/2, so 10 tens is larger than 1/2 ten.",20,mtms2011-11-244a,,
"•	 Rename to equivalent numerals, then  compare using the first strategy.  Example: 200 tenths versus  20 tens. 200 tenths are equal to  20 ones.  •	 Rename to equivalent place values,  then compare using the second strategy.    Example: 500 thousandths versus 20 hundredths. Since thousandths are 1/10 the size of hundredths, I would need 10 thousandths to make 1 hundredth. Therefore,  500 thousandths should be the same as 50 hundredths.  •	 Compare multiplicatively.  ",21,mtms2011-11-244a,,

"Example: 50 thousandths versus 5 tenths. Tenths are 100 times as large as thousandths, but 50 is  only 10 times as many as 5. The  5 tenths choice is larger.  •	 Use benchmarks.   Example: 200 thousandths versus  50 tenths. It takes 1000 thousandths to make 1, so 200 thousandths is less than 1. It takes  10 tenths to make 1, so 50 tenths  is greater than 1.",27,mtms2011-11-244a,,
"•	 Write the amounts using decimal  notation and compare by  “lining up” decimal points.  Example: 20 thousandths = 0.020 versus 5 hundredths = 0.05. Since 5 and 2 are both in the hundredths place and 5 is greater than 2, the 5 hundredths is larger. When students rely on such rule-based strategies, we encourage them to use additional strategies to make connections to the reasoning behind the rules. ",28,mtms2011-11-244a,,
"While playing this game, we hope that students explore and begin to use flexibly a variety of strategies. When there is a conflict, we recommend encouraging students to convince their opponent by using at least two different strategies. We also find that encouraging students to refer to representations they are comfortable with, such as 10 × 10 grids, fractions, currency, or metric measures, provides additional support when explaining what their numbers mean and which number is larger. (See the sidebar.)",29,mtms2011-11-244a,,

"It is critical to establish classroom norms for the types of mathematical arguments that students pursue to convince one another of their mathematical assertion (Rathouz 2011; Yackel and Cobb 1996). For example, we recommend encouraging students to use 10 × 10 grids and their knowledge about fractions (such as finding equivalent fractions or using benchmark fractions) as tools to justify their decisions about the amounts formed by drawing their cards.",31,mtms2011-11-244a,,
"The games are designed to develop and consolidate students’ knowledge of quantities and the numbers representing those quantities, not to promote use of symbolic rules they may not understand. Therefore, we discourage the introduction or use of the symbolic form of decimal numbers until after students have established other means of determining the values of the amounts composed by the cards. When disagreements occur, posing some of the following questions can help students think about the meaning of decimals and make connections between fractions and decimals:  •	 How	do	we	say	this	amount?	 •	 Is	there	another	way	to	say	this	 amount?	 •	 What	does	the	place-value	part	tell	 you	about	the	amount	you	formed? •	 What	does	the	numeral	part	tell	 you	about	the	amount	you	formed? •	 How	would	you	write	this	amount	 as	a	fraction? •	 How	do	you	know	which	amount	 is	larger?	 •	 How	do	you	decide	who	wins	a	 round? •	 Are	there	ways	to	represent	this	 amount	that	might	help	you? •	 Could	you	use	a	10	× 10 grid to  show	each	amount? •	 Is	this	amount	more	or	less	than	1?

"Listening to students as they play these games and provide a rationale for decisions gives teachers opportunities to assess students’ understanding of decimals. While students are playing, we recommend looking at the following issues:  common Representations  of Base-ten Fractions ·  10 × 10 grids: As introduced in the first game, students recognize that  one 10 × 10 grid represents 1 whole. Students should be able to reason with their peers as to why one column or one row represents 1 tenth of the whole. They should reason consistently that one small square represents  1 hundredth of the whole.  ·  Common fractions (1000; 100; 10; 1; 1/10; 1/100; 1/1000): A value such as 500 thousandths may be more understandable when written  as a fraction, or 500/1000. It might be clearer to see that this fraction  is equal to 1/2 and therefore equivalent to 50/100 (50 hundredths),  and 5/10 (5 tenths).",34,mtms2011-11-244a,,
"·  Currency (thousand, hundred, ten, one, dime, cent): Students often feel comfortable using the context of money to solve problems. When they try to decide which number is bigger, it is common for them to think of these values in terms of currency. For example, they can easily compare 1 tenth with 20 hundredths, as they think of 1 tenth as a dime and 20 hundredths as 20 cents.",35,mtms2011-11-244a,,
"·  Metric measures (kilo-, hecto-, deka-, meter, deci-, centi-, milli-): ",36,mtms2011-11-244a,,
"Introducing students to metric measures and connecting these measures to decimal numbers can also be useful. For example, 20 thousandths of a meter is equal to 20 millimeters, in which a millimeter is a thousandth of a meter. This length on a ruler can also be named 2 centimeters, or 2 hundredths of a meter.",37,mtms2011-11-244a,,
"•	 Are	students	able	to	understand	 and compare the values on the card combinations? •	 Are	they	able	to	translate	among	 multiple representations, such as a 10 × 10 grid, a fraction, and decimal	notation? •	 How	do	they	justify	the	mathematical	thinking	in	their	strategies?	",38,mtms2011-11-244a,,
"To gain insight into the understanding of the whole class, teachers may want to collect individual written assessments of students’ justifications. Responses to “exit ticket” prompts such as those shown below can be used to uncover typical student language, reasoning, and misconceptions as well as provide a written record of the decimal thinking used in the games: •	 While	playing	Shade	Close	to	2,	 write about one helpful strategy you used for selecting cards. Explain how you decided which cards to use on that turn.  •	 During	a	turn	in	Compare	and	",39,mtms2011-11-244a,,

Present a convincing argument. ,41,mtms2011-11-244a,,
"Teachers will likely modify the games in response to their students’ needs or levels of understanding. For example, they could introduce the games by playing against the whole class; asking teams of two students to play against each other, as teamwork helps to foster discussion among students; and including or eliminating certain  cards to make the games more or less challenging. For example, place-value cards could be extended to range from 10 thousandths to 10 thousands or the 1/2 card could be removed. Finally, as you become more familiar with your students’ thinking, we encourage you to experiment with other games and activities in which these cards might be used to support understanding of the decimal placevalue system.
