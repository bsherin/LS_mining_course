Accurate Lab Readings,1,mtms2011-02-384a,,
Bart is a technician in a medical lab. It is important that his instruments provide him with accurate readings so that doctors can make an appropriate diagnosis based on his work. He has a new blood analyzing machine (BAM) and must establish quality-control ranges to determine the machine’s accuracy. The manufacturer sends Bart two samples of blood containing known levels of glucose. Sample A is high at 230 mg/dL. Sample B is low at 70 mg/dL. Bart runs each sample through the BAM twenty times. The results are in the table below.  trial sample a (mg/dl) sample B (mg/dl) 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 71 70 68 69 72 70 69 68 69 70 70 67 70 71 73 70 69 71 70 70 230 231 230 230 232 228 229 230 228 232 231 230 230 230 231 227 230 233 231 232,2,mtms2011-02-384a,,
"PRoBleMs 1.  For each sample A and sample B, what is the mean for the glucose level measured for each sample? Round to two decimal places. What is the median for each?  2.  Which would you choose for your analysis, the mean or the median? Why?   The data in the table show that the BAM gave slightly different readings for the same blood sample. Bart determines that if a reading is within 0.5 of the “true” value, 70, it is deemed acceptable. Use a random-number generator to pick two readings from each list.  3.  Find the mean of these read- ings. As a class, see what percent of your sample means is within 69.5–70.5. How was this range determined? 4.  Do the same procedure, but use four readings from each list. As a class, see what percent of your means is within 69.5–70.5.",3,mtms2011-02-384a,,
"5.  If each test costs $2, would you prefer to have every tested blood sample run once, twice, or four times? Would more runs be preferable?  6.  If each test costs $200, would you prefer to have every tested blood sample run once, twice, or four times? Would more runs be preferable? ",4,mtms2011-02-384a,,

Sample A: Mean = 69.85,   median = 70   Sample B: Mean = 230.25,   median = 230 2.  The mean should be chosen. Since there are no outliers, this measure is okay. If students answer median, they must have a mathematically valid reason. Some students may prefer the median, as it gives the stated value from the lab as  its result. Good discussion about measures of center and variability can result from this question.",6,mtms2011-02-384a,,
3.  Answers will vary. Be sure that each person uses different numbers from the set. Have students press a random number several times on a calculator to ensure that not all students are starting at the same point in the calculator’s random number system. A table may be easier to use for random numbers.,7,mtms2011-02-384a,,
