"Francis (Skip) Fennell nNCTM’s Curriculum Focal Points  for Prekindergarten through Grade 8 Mathematics: A Quest for Coherence was published in 2006. Change, or reform, has been something we in mathematics education have been involved with for decades—some would say since Sputnik, or for half a century. The intent of Curriculum Focal Points is to begin a dialogue relative to curricular reform at the pre-K–8 level, paying particular attention to state and local school district curricular frameworks. Some state frameworks contain over 100 outcomes at each grade level. What’s a teacher to do? What’s really important at these grade levels?",2,mtms2007-08-4a,,

"Since the release of the Curriculum Focal Points, about one-fourth of the states and many local school districts have decided to use the Focal Points to drive discussions about what is important in pre-K–8 mathematics  sor of education at McDaniel College, Westminster, MD 21157.",4,mtms2007-08-4a,,

"If your state or school district chose to use the Curriculum Focal Points to develop fewer outcomes per grade level, what then?  •	 What would be the points of  emphasis at the grade or grades for which you are responsible? Why? •	 If you need to spend more time  on critical topics in grades 5, 6, 7, and 8, what would be deleted from your school district or state curricular frameworks? Why?  •	 How much time would you  propose be spent on these areas of emphasis, or Focal Points? Is the time dispersed throughout the year or is it concentrated? •	 What kind of activities would  you use to help students acquire the depth suggested in the Focal Points, relative to various topics, such as rational numbers? Division of whole numbers? Proportion? •	 If students are to take algebra 1 in seventh or eighth grade, how would the mathematics provided in Curriculum Focal Points for grades  7 and/or 8 be acquired?  •	 How can we get state assessments to address particular Focal Points or emphasize topics within a particular grade or grades?  in the classrooM",6,mtms2007-08-4a,,
"In the next several issues of Mathematics Teaching in the Middle School, the Curriculum Focal Points articles will attempt to take the Focal Points into your classroom. Not only will we try to address some of the questions posed above, but authors will also move from the curriculum into the area of instruction and consider what teaching would look like when fewer topics are emphasized. These are just two questions that will be important to explore: •  How will the Process Standards of ",7,mtms2007-08-4a,,

These issues and others will be addressed as the Curriculum Focal Points become a part of the mathematics classroom. ●,9,mtms2007-08-4a,,
