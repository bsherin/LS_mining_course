3,Cartoon Corner: Dipping into the Fibonacci Numbers,"Leonardo Fibonacci (c. 1170–c. 1240) was a European mathematician. In 1202, he discussed a sequence in which each number (after the fi rst two) is the sum of the two preceding numbers. The fi rst six numbers in the sequence, known as Fibonacci numbers, are given in the table below.",3,Cartoon Corner: Dipping into the Fibonacci Numbers

21,Cartoon Corner: Dipping into the Fibonacci Numbers,"I tried the Fibonachos cartoon with my prealgebra and geometry classes. Since my geometry students had already learned about the golden ratio, I had already discussed the Fibonacci sequence with them. In fact, when I taught them consecutive integers in algebra 1, one student had inquired about how to express  values coming from previous terms that were not necessarily increasing by a constant. I gave the class a brief introduction to recursive algorithms, so the Fibonacci numbers intrigued and excited them.",21,Cartoon Corner: Dipping into the Fibonacci Numbers

30,Cartoon Corner: Dipping into the Fibonacci Numbers,"My sixth-grade prealgebra student reactions to the cartoon ranged from  “I don’t get it” to “Aha! I get this one!” Exposing students to Fibonacci  numbers before they read this cartoon definitely made a difference in the initial understanding. Everyone enjoyed calculating terms in the sequence, but few were willing to create a table to track their calculations. I would definitely recommend creating a table to list the term number as well as the corresponding Fibonacci number for question 1 to help students grasp the questions that follow.",30,Cartoon Corner: Dipping into the Fibonacci Numbers

My eighth-grade algebra students study environmental science, and the article provided a natural extension for previously covered content.

42,Cartoon Corner: Dipping into the Fibonacci Numbers,"My advanced algebra students  had seen the sequence before. They completed the activity with a partner and presented their solutions to the class. My algebra 1 part 1 class was just starting to explore functions and their multiple representations, so we worked through the questions together, modeling the pattern with data tables and scatter plots. The part 1 class used a calculator with the question that was looking for the 35th term. They were accustomed to working with linear functions and found it interesting that the gap between each data point kept increasing in size. It was good for them to see that not every situation has a constant rate of change. Some students quickly opened their computers to find other examples of the Fibonacci sequence in nature.
