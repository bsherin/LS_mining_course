"Alfinio Flores alfinio Flores, alfinio@math.udel.edu, teaches mathematics and mathematics education courses at the University of Delaware. He uses concrete and visual approaches and technology to help students better understand mathematics concepts and to help teachers develop a thorough understanding of the mathematics they teach and of how students learn.  dDiverse contexts such as take away,  comparison, and completion give rise to subtraction problems. The take-away interpretation of subtraction has been explored using two-colored chips to help students understand addition and subtraction of integers (Bennett and Musser 1976). This article will show how the difference and completion interpretations of subtraction may be illustrated with colored chips to help students develop a better understanding  of the subtraction of negative and positive numbers. Black chips will represent positive numbers, and white chips will represent negative numbers. The basic principle is that chips of different colors will cancel each other when joined together; this pair of chips is called a zero-pair. Several zero-pairs together will still have a zero value. Each collection in figure 1 represents zero. ",3,mtms2008-08-21a,,

"objects in the second collection. The first 3 objects in the collection of 7 are matched with the objects in the second collection. The number of unmatched objects is the difference, in this case, 4 (see fig. 3). The same approach works when comparing negative numbers (see fig. 4). What if the first collection has fewer objects than the second, for example, in the problem 2 – 5? (see fig. + + 5a). Because we do not have enough in –– the collection of 2 objects to match all + the objects in the second collection of 5, we need to represent 2 in a different way by adding three zero-pairs (see fig. 5b). Now we can match five objects in the collection representing 2 with all objects in the collection representing 5. The –– difference is –3 (see fig. 5c). We can use the same method of adding zeros when comparing collections of chips of different color, as shown in figure 6a.

"When working with chips to represent + + subtraction problems, students need to pay attention to the different roles that the numbers take, which reflects the fact that subtraction is not commutative. For example, 5 – 3 and 3 – 5 give very different results. The role that 3 has in each of these problems is very different. Students need to think clearly about the different roles of the first and second numbers in a subtraction problem, both in the difference and the completion contexts.
