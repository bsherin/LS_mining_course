0,Ancient Paradoxes Can Extend Mathematical Thinking - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Have you ever thought about teaching mathematics through making connections to logic and philosophy? This article presents the Snail problem, a relatively simple challenge about motion that offers engaging extensions involving the notion of infinity. It encourages students in grades 59 to connect mathematics learning to logic, history, and philosophy through analyzing the problem, making sense of quantitative relationships, and modeling with mathematics (NGAC 2010). It also gives students of all ages a glimpse into the development of mathematics by introducing a reason to think about infinite convergent series.",,

2,Ancient Paradoxes Can Extend Mathematical Thinking - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Zeno of Elea was a Greek philosopher who wrote during the times of Socrates and Plato; he also influenced Aristotles thinking. One of Zenos paradoxes, called The Dichotomy, says that movement is impossible because that which is in locomotion must arrive at the half-way stage before it arrives at the goal (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy 2010). Before one can reach point B from point A, one has to pass the halfway point, C1. And before one can reach C1, one must reach the halfway point between A and C1, which is C 2 (see fig. 1). Continuing this division-of-space-by-two (The Dichotomy), one would never move because there are an unlimited number of halfway points but only a limited amount of time to reach them all. If we think about the starting point A being at 0 and the goal point B, at a distance of 1, then we can represent the goal point and halfway goal points as a geometric sequence (see fig. 2):",,

6,Ancient Paradoxes Can Extend Mathematical Thinking - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Aristotles response to this argument, written in his book Physics, was to consider that if we divide the distance between goal points in half, then we should also divide the time taken to reach the halfway point in half. Although this solution resolves the paradox as stated, Aristotle realized that it introduced a new problem: Now there are an infinite number of finite pieces of time! One resolution to the paradox is to introduce the idea of convergent series. Figure 2 illustrates how the total distance can be seen as the infinite convergent series",,

10,Ancient Paradoxes Can Extend Mathematical Thinking - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"A snail is at the bottom of a 10 foot well. Every day, he crawls up 3 feet, but at night, he slips down 2 feet. How many days will it take for him to get out of the well?",,
11,Ancient Paradoxes Can Extend Mathematical Thinking - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We gave the Snail problem to middle school and high school students and assisted them with problem solving by asking follow-up questions about their thinking. Students checked the first few days and noticed a daily net gain of 1 foot. They used this information to conclude that the snail escapes on day 10. However, when we look at the total net gain over time, the snail will actually escape on day 8. Below, we present an in-depth look at student solution strategiessome of which yield incorrect answersand extensions of the original problem.",,

13,Ancient Paradoxes Can Extend Mathematical Thinking - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Bree, a prealgebra student, drew a diagram of a well with the numbers 110 on the side to represent the height of the well (see fig. 3). She said that every day he crawls up 3 feet, so he gets up to about right here every day [between the 3rd and 4th partition], but at night he slips down 2 feet, so he only really crawls a foot a day. She then drew 10 partitions in the well and labeled them to note the day the snail was at that location. She concluded it would take the snail 10 days to reach the top.",,

16,Ancient Paradoxes Can Extend Mathematical Thinking - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Lucy, an algebra student, also drew a diagram and then used a system of dots to help her count. When asked to explain her thinking, Lucy used real-world reasoning: It would be 9 days for him to get out of the well because he goes up every day three feet and he goes down two. So hes just going up one foot every day. Well, it will take him nine to get up to the top of the well, so it will take him 10 to get out.",,

18,Ancient Paradoxes Can Extend Mathematical Thinking - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Bree. We extended the problem for Bree by varying the height of the climb: Suppose he was just climbing up a cliff face. Could you write an expression that would tell how far hes crawled after how many days?,,
19,Ancient Paradoxes Can Extend Mathematical Thinking - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Bree clarified, So you dont know how long the wall is? And we confirmed. Bree wrote 3  2, and then generalized, It would just be 1 times the number and that equals how many it gets up a day. If the wall is 20 feet, 1 times 20 would equal 20 feet, or 20 days it would take to crawl the 20 foot wall. Once Bree had a general strategy, we extended the problem to a noninteger height of 38.5 feet. Bree responded, Itll take half of a day, but its still a day that youre counting. So it would be 39.",,
20,Ancient Paradoxes Can Extend Mathematical Thinking - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Next, to encourage Bree to generalize her solution strategy, we changed the net rate at which the snail ascended to be a noninteger. Now the snail climbed 3 feet every day, slid down 1.5 feet every night, and had to climb a 38.5-foot cliff face. Bree wrote 1.5  _____ to indicate that the answer would be the number multiplied by 1.5 to get 38.5. She began to do long division for 38.5  1.5, but she did not know how to do long division with a decimal divisor. Instead, she drew a diagram with 39 tick marks and began counting the number of 1.5s there were from 0 to 38.5. Even though she miscounted, she arrived at an answer of 28 days because she counted 27 1.5s, and the last half-foot required another day to begin.",,
21,Ancient Paradoxes Can Extend Mathematical Thinking - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Peter. Peter, a prealgebra student, carefully counted +3 and 2 for each day that passed until the snail reached a height of 10 feet. He got 8 days as his answer. We extended the problem by giving different heights for the well (20 feet and 30 feet) and then asked how long it would take if the height were unknown. Peter got answers of 18 days and 28 days, respectively. He said that figuring out an unknown depth would be kinda hard, because without the feet of the well, we wouldnt know where to start. When asked if he could see a pattern and make an expression from that, he organized his results in a chart (see fig. 4). He labeled number of days as d and ft of well as w and wrote the expression w = d + 2. He then solved for d = w  2 . He used the expression to explain the relationship between the depth of the well and the number of days to crawl out, but he noted that the depth would need to be known.",,

23,Ancient Paradoxes Can Extend Mathematical Thinking - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Jill. We extended the problem for Jill, a postalgebra student, by varying the parameters for the depth of the well and the snails rates of ascent and descent. Jill solved for the number of days for the snail to get out of a 30 foot well if it climbed 8 feet during the day and fell back 2 feet at night. Then Jill worked on a scenario in which the snail climbed 3 feet during the day and slid down 1.5 feet at night. She generalized to the equation in figure 5, where x was the rate of ascent, y was the rate of descent, # feet was the depth of the well, and days was the number of days it would take. She checked her formula by using the information from the original problem.",,

29,Ancient Paradoxes Can Extend Mathematical Thinking - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Susan worked out this problem by using halving strategies to keep track of the total distance traveled by the snail. Eventually, she noticed that the snail would have to go shorter distances each day to get to the top of the well and that it would probably get out but itd take him a long, long time.",,
30,Ancient Paradoxes Can Extend Mathematical Thinking - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Caspian. Caspian, a prealgebra student, quickly found an algorithm to help him solve an extension similar to the problem posed to Susan, although in his case, the depth of the well was 10 feet. Caspian used standard addition and division algorithms to find that the first day, the snail traveled 5 feet; the second day, 2.5 feet (total 7.5); the third day, 1.25 feet (total 8.75), and so on. He concluded that the total distance traveled by the snail would never come to exactly 10 feet. He justified his reasoning by saying, Because [the total] passed 9, then I have to add more numbers [referring to additional decimal places when dividing the remaining distance by 2]. . . . I am not gonna get exactly 10. Caspian re-created Zenos philosophical paradox. (See fig. 6.)",,

36,Ancient Paradoxes Can Extend Mathematical Thinking - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In all previous examples, the snail has been considered an abstract point. However, as an added challenge, students may want to consider the practical matter that the snail has an actual length and that the snail could in fact crawl out when the center of its body reaches the edge of the well. Using this reasoning, a student might come to the conclusion that the error in the finite approximation of the infinite series is truncated on the day that the snails center reaches the top of the well. This scenario can be described by the exponential equation",,

40,Ancient Paradoxes Can Extend Mathematical Thinking - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The Snail problem is very rich because it provides a platform that promotes reasoning and problem solving. It allows for multiple entry points and ample opportunities to demonstrate varied solution strategies (NCTM 2014). The possible extension for more advanced students is especially interesting when viewed as a formalization of the younger students ideas. For instance, the infinite geometric series formalizes (and resolves!) Caspians solution, with the total distance never reaching 10 feet. The observation that real snails are not points, but have length, echoes how Lucy brought in her real-world knowledge to solve the original Snail problem. Although middle school students may not reason as formally as those in the higher grades, they are certainly capable of engaging with the ideas that philosophers and mathematicians from Zeno all the way to Cauchy grappled with.",,
41,Ancient Paradoxes Can Extend Mathematical Thinking - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The possible extensions of the Snail problem can elicit a wealth of mathematical ideas. The extensions also demonstrate how versatile a problem can be. Students should be encouraged to compare their models of the problem and how the models change as parameters vary (e.g., rates of ascent and descent, depth of the well, and so on). These extensions naturally lead to connections between the Snail problem and notions of infinity.",,
