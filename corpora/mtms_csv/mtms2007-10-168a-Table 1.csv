The Diaz family went to the Dizzy Amusement Park. The tickets cost $73 for 3 adults and 5 children. The Anderson family paid $93 for 7 adults and 2 children. The Owens-Faulkner family reunion will need tickets for 55 adults and 53 children. What will be the total cost for the Owens-Faulkner family reunion to enter the amusement park? (No group discounts were given.),2,mtms2007-10-168a,,
"Most students solved the task by  using a guess-and-check method similar to Lisa’s in figure 1 and Ryan’s in figure 2. Lisa and Ryan are from Sharon Hurwich’s sixthgrade mathematics class at Glenfield Middle School in New Jersey. Both students started by guessing prices for an adult and child’s ticket, then adjusting the prices until they satisfied the conditions for the total amounts spent by the Diaz and Anderson families. The final set of prices for an adult and child’s ticket ",3,mtms2007-10-168a,,

Fig. 1 Lisa’s solution,6,mtms2007-10-168a,,
"To solve this problem, I guessed at first. For the adult cost, I said it was $9.00, and for the child cost, I said it was $8.00. For the Diaz family, the total cost for 3 adults and 5 children was $73.00, but using my guesses the total cost would only be $67.00, so I knew I had to raise the cost.",7,mtms2007-10-168a,,
"Then I made the adult cost $10.00, and I kept the child cost at $8.00. Using those costs, it made the Diaz total $70.00. I had to raise it by 3, and I knew that there are 3 adults so I added one dollar to that cost. Now I had the adult cost at $11.00 and the child cost at $8.00 and it worked for the Diaz family, then I tried those costs for the Anderson family and it worked there also.",8,mtms2007-10-168a,,
"The Owens-Faulkner family reunion needed 55 adult tickets and 53 children tickets. I took the costs and all I did was 55 × 11 = 605 and 53 × 8 = 424. Then I added the adult total and the children total together (605 + 424), which is 1029, so the total cost for the Owens-Faulkner family reunion is $1029.00.",9,mtms2007-10-168a,,

Fig. 3 Eital’s solution,11,mtms2007-10-168a,,
"I found the answer by first writing the prices for adults and children ($7.00 adults and $6.00 children’s). Then I kept adding more until I finally got to $11.00 and $8.00. I knew I had to go up because the total price was higher than my guess. That made me make the prices for children’s and adults higher until it was equal with both of the situations. So the OwensFaulkner family had to pay a total of $1,029 for children and adults. I actually had to make sure that the prices went into $73.00 and $93.00. At first, I thought the adults paid more, but they didn’t. Actually it doesn’t matter, but adults are usually more. I basically did the guess and check method to find the answer.",12,mtms2007-10-168a,,
were then used to determine how much the Owens-Faulkner family paid to enter the amusement park. ,13,mtms2007-10-168a,,
"Other students used number sense  to fine-tune their guess-and-check method. Eital, who is also from Sharon Hurwich’s class, decided that since the Diaz family paid for 3 adults, the total price of the 3 adult tickets had to be a multiple of 3 with a 3 in the ones digit, since no multiple of 5 has a 3 in the ones digit. (See fig. 3.) After examining $13 and $23, she found that $33 would be the total price of the 3 adult tickets. From there, she successfully solved the task. Zach from Ben Grimes’ seventh-grade mathematics class at Dutch Fork Middle School in South Carolina wrote two equations to represent the Diaz family and Anderson family situations. He combined the equations to get 166 = 10a + 7c, where a represented the price of an adult ticket and c represented the price of a child’s ticket. Zach reasoned that ",14,mtms2007-10-168a,,
The following is how I figured out this problem:,15,mtms2007-10-168a,,
"I saw that the Diaz family spent $73.00 on 3 adults and 5 children to go to the state fair. I started out with the adult prices and decided that, of course, they had to be a multiple of 3 because there are 3 adults. I also decided that the multiple would end in 3. I didn’t start out with 1 times 3 because I forgot, and also $1.00 wouldn’t be a likely price for an adult. Then, I checked if 3 went into 13 evenly. I found no. After that, I checked if 3 went into 23 evenly. I also found no. And then I did 33 and it worked! I did $33.00 divided by 3 and got $11.00. So, so far, I had guessed that an adult’s price for 1 ticket was $11.00 and we had 3 adults, so that equaled $33.00. I subtracted $33.00 from $73.00 and got $40.00. Then I divided $40.00 by 5, the amount of children and got $8.00. So now my guess is that an adult’s price is $11.00 and a child’s price is $8.00.",16,mtms2007-10-168a,,
"To check if my answer was right, I tried it out on the Andersons, who paid $93.00 for 7 adults and 2 children. I multiplied 7 by $11.00 and added 2 multiplied by $8.00 and got $93.00! This is when I knew I was correct and all I had to do was find out how much the Owens-Faulkner family pays. To find the amount the Owens-Faulkner family pays, I multiplied the 55 adults by $11 and added the cost for the children, 53 multiplied by $8.00 and my answer was $1,029.00!",17,mtms2007-10-168a,,
"Fig. 4 Zach’s solution since a multiple of 10 will not have a 6 in the ones digit, then the multiple of 7 must have 6 in the ones digit. The first multiple of 7 that he tried was 56. After finding that the multiple resulted in the child’s ticket being $8, he successfully solved the task. (See fig. 4.) It should be pointed out that Eital’s and Zach’s reasoning, just as that of many students who used the  guess-and-check method, was based on the assumption that the ticket prices were whole-dollar amounts. If, for example, the adult ticket price had been $9.60, then 10 tickets would have cost $96, resulting in a total price with a 6 in the ones digit. Not all students assumed that the ticket prices were in whole-dollar amounts. Mackenzie from Marcia Hall’s ",18,mtms2007-10-168a,,

"Some students used algebraic methods to solve the task. Tania and Marta, from José Francisco Sala García’s mathematics class at the Instituto de Educación Secundaria Sa Colomina in Ibiza, Spain, used algebra to solve the task. Tania used two equations to solve for the price of an adult ticket, then substituted the price into an equation to solve for the price of a child’s ticket. She then substituted both prices into a third equation to find the price that the Owens-Faulkner family paid. Marta represented the price of an adult ticket in relation to the price of a child’s ticket. She substituted the expression into a second equation to solve for the price of a child’s ticket, then found the price of an adult ticket before finding the final solution. (See figs. 6 and 7.)",21,mtms2007-10-168a,,
"Arimie’s algebraic method did not require finding the ticket prices for an adult and child. Arimie multiplied the equation representing the Diaz family, 3A + 5C = 73, by 9. She multiplied the equation representing the Anderson family, 7A + 2C = 93, by 4. She combined the resulting equations to get 55A + 53C = 1029, which represented the Owens-Faulkner family. Arimie is a seventh-grade student in Yuliya Steshenko’s mathematics class at St. Andrews Junior High School in Ontario, Canada. (See fig. 8.) eXtensions",22,mtms2007-10-168a,,

"For the first task, it will be possible to make all postage values. The GCF of (5, 7) is 1, and all the postage values are multiples of 1. For the second task, only postage values that are multiples of 2 can be made, since the GCF of (6, 8) is 2. For the third and fourth tasks, only postage values that are multiples of 3 and 4, respectively, can be made. The solutions to the stamp tasks will be ordered pairs of nonnegative integers, since you want to have a certain number of each stamp to make the given postage value. The generalized equation will have a wider range of integer solutions that do not necessarily fit the context. For the equation 6x + 9y = 3, (–1, 1) is an integer solution to the equation. Notice also that if searching for an integer solution for 6x + 9y = 51, a student can  multiply the solution to 6x + 9y = 3 by 17, since 3 × 17 = 51. So (–17, 17) is an integer solution to the equation 6x + 9y = 51. This will not give all integer solutions to 6x + 9y = 51, since there are many, but it will help give an integer solution.
