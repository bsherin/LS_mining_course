"A Mysterious Connection tThe stage was set. A preservice  elementary teacher entered Mrs. Burnell’s seventh-grade classroom, wearing a raincoat and holding a flashlight, and stole a poster placed on the front board. The middle school students were stunned. What just happened? Several minutes later, four preservice elementary teachers entered the classroom and began acting out a dramatization based on a chapter of Balliett’s novel Chasing Vermeer (2004). They selected a scene in which characters in the book use pentominoes to try to solve a mystery, which was a perfect segue into the mathematics lesson that follows.",1,mtms2007-10-134a,,

Following the dramatization, each middle school student received 1 inch × 1 inch Postit notes and were given directions as to how the squares must be lined up edge to edge, not corner to corner, to create a pentomino. The preservice teachers demonstrated how to align the Post-its at the front board by using three Post-its to make each of the two tromino shapes and using four Post-its to display the five tetromino shapes (see fig. 1).  10.",15,mtms2007-10-134a,,

Several students walked to the front board and wrote the perimeter beside each piece. “Why is there only one pentomino with a different perimeter? Did you count correctly?” asked one of the preservice teachers. “I know we counted a perimeter of twelve for all the pentominoes except this one!” responded a student. “I think it is because more of the squares are closer together.

They were asked to trace the pentomino onto a piece of paper and fold it where they expected a line of symmetry to occur. Several students thought that there were only two lines of symmetry, but several found four lines. The preservice teachers were quick to challenge the students to find as many lines of symmetry as they could for each pentomino, using the same procedure.

"The preservice teachers then asked  whether any pentominoes contained rotational symmetry. The students had studied transformations, and even though a bulletin board in their room contained examples of different transformations, they began exploring each pentomino. By tracing then rotating the pentominoes, the students could verify that only three pentominoes of the twelve had rotational symmetry. “Wow, there is a lot of math with these!” one student said. “This is only the beginning,” countered one preservice teacher.

"The preservice teachers instructed the students to trace the pentominoes used in the code and write the number on each figure traced. See figure 4. “What does that tell us?” asked one of the students. “It doesn’t spell anything, even if you scramble up the letters,” replied another student. “Well, Calder and his friend created a decoder [see Balliett 2004, p. 57] so that they could communicate securely with each other,” replied one preservice teacher. “Let’s look at the decoder they used.” ",55,mtms2007-10-134a,,
"The students were given a copy of the decoder and asked to spend a few minutes with their partners to see if they could decode the secret word. See figure 5. Within minutes, most pairs had found that the code spelled THINK. Next, the preservice teachers gave each pair of students a copy of a secret message from the book to try to decipher. The decoding was exciting. “I really like doing these,” replied one of the students. “Me, too; I always wanted to learn how to write secret codes,” added another.",56,mtms2007-10-134a,,
"“Let’s create a code of our own,” one preservice teacher said. “Since Calder wrote all the letters of the alphabet in order and assigned each to one of the pentominoes, we could do something similar. But we can be more sophisticated in our code.” The middle school students were anxious to begin. ",57,mtms2007-10-134a,,

"K W (Balliett 2004, p. 57) numbers, then uses a shift function to determine the encoded numbers. Students were given the following example. List all the letters represented by the pentominoes. Then, using a +3 shift cipher, take a code, such as X2, X1, P2, P1, and shift down by three letters. For example, start with X2, which equals V, then count down three letters. In this case, in counting the three letters, go down the chart but stay in the same column, which means counting from the top of the chart. In so doing, V + 3 will equal M. Continuing in this way, the code represents the word MATH. The symbolic equation c = pa + 3 was introduced, where c represents the coded value, p represents the pentomino, and a represents the column of 1, 2, or 3. “So the symbolic equation for the code above ",61,mtms2007-10-134a,,

Students worked in groups, wrote a message, and encoded it with a shift function. Groups then exchanged the encoded sequence and their function with another group and discovered how to decode their messages. The preservice teachers challenged the students to think about several questions as they played with the codes. “What if you shift +7, then shift –3? This is a two-step process. Can we shorten it to one step?” The students soon realized this action was ",63,mtms2007-10-134a,,

"“What if we assigned each letter of the alphabet a number from 1 through 26? Then we could do something similar to what Calder did but add some algebra to it!” exclaimed a preservice teacher. The classroom was buzzing. “Let’s look at the following table,” stated another teacher. (See fig. 6.) “Using a shift cipher of +5, what would the coded value be for the letter K?” The students found the letter K and added 5 to the value of 11 to find the coded value of 16, which is the letter P. They were then asked to use the same shift cipher and decode the following:  (a)                 (b) 8 20 9 10 24   6 23 10   11 26 19 (Answer: Codes are fun)",68,mtms2007-10-134a,,
"The students were asked to write in their notebooks the symbolic equation that would represent this shift function. Students compared what they wrote to check their answers. The preservice teachers verified that their equations were c = a + 5, where c represents the coded value and a represents the position of the alphabet letter. “What  if we look at a point where the coordinates are (a, c)? The a represents the  X value and the c represents the Y value that we are familiar with when plotting points,” said one preservice teacher. The  (a)                 (b) code just discussed would represent the points (8, 13), (15, 20), (4, 9), (5, 10), and (19, 24). The graph that these points made shows how the cipher code shifts the alphabet (see fig. 7).",69,mtms2007-10-134a,,
"“Look, it’s a straight line!” responded the students. “Does anyone know what kind of function this graph represents?” asked a preservice teacher. “Yes, it’s a linear function,” several students responded. “Wow, all this math from a story,” mumbled one of the students. ",70,mtms2007-10-134a,,
The preservice teachers moved the  topic back to pentominoes. Each of the teachers had put two pentominoes together and had traced the perimeter of the mystery shape (fig. 8a). They passed out copies of the shapes and asked students to work in pairs to determine which two pentominoes created the figure. The students quickly grabbed their sets of pentominoes and tried to find the ones that created the various figures (fig. 8b).,71,mtms2007-10-134a,,
"“This is like a mystery, too,” replied one of the students. “You could make a code using figures like these to represent a secret message also,” she added. “Sounds like a challenge you might want to try to create to send a secret code to your fellow classmates,” responded a preservice teacher.

"This classroom scenario occurred as the result of a joint project given to the preservice teachers in their language arts methods course and elementary mathematics methods course. Six middle school classrooms in an urban district each had four preservice teachers act out the dramatization and involve the students in the mathematical connections. In a survey given at the beginning of the semester, the majority of the preservice teachers stated they had little to no experience learning mathematics through literature. They were also unsure of how to successfully connect literature and mathematics. ",74,mtms2007-10-134a,,
"This interdisciplinary project  required that they read the novel Chasing Vermeer and maintain a reader’s response journal to record discussion questions, vocabulary explorations, language structure, mathematical connections, and other interdisciplinary connections. The use of pentominoes was only one of the mathematical connections found throughout the novel. Others included Roman numerals, geometric shapes, patterns, symmetry, and some historical mathematics. ",75,mtms2007-10-134a,,
"As they worked together on the development of the dramatization and mathematics lesson based on the novel, the teachers discussed major themes and clues and learned concepts related to pentominoes, including lines of symmetry, transformations, perimeter, spatial perception, and coding theories. Evidence of their enhanced knowledge and confidence in integrating language arts and mathematical concepts were expressed in their journals and in the lesson planning. One teacher wrote: “For students, like me, who are not good in math or who don’t like math, incorporating good children’s literature gives students a chance to learn math in a way that is more enjoyable to them.”",76,mtms2007-10-134a,,
"The reflective journals also indicated that the preservice teachers recognized the need to seek novels that include various aspects of mathematics or other subjects. They also noted the need to make the connection engaging, because “just reading literature and following it with a mathematics lesson would not be as effective as acting out a dramatization.” The preservice teachers realized that teaching interactive and engaging lessons work best. They recognized that motivating students to want to learn is important, especially at the middle school level. “The use of a dramatization to connect the literature and mathematics really captured the students’ interest.” “They [the middle school students] really were into the story and the lesson. I can see now the importance of using literature to excite students into doing a math lesson.” Teachers who are interested in designing integrated mathematics and literature lessons around the book can act out a scene from the book on their own or possibly show a video where students from another class have acted out a scene to launch the lessons.",77,mtms2007-10-134a,,

"The NCTM’s Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for School Mathematics (1989) supports the integration of  children’s literature into the K–8 classroom: “Many children’s books present interesting problems and illustrate how other children solve them. Through these books students see mathematics in a different context while they use reading as a form of communication” (p. 28). In addition, Principles and Standards for School Mathematics (NCTM 2000) states: “Children’s literature is helpful in setting a context for both student-generated and teacher-posed problems” (p. 118). The connections between the literature and the geometry concepts helped middle school students build mathematical understanding. ",79,mtms2007-10-134a,,
Both the preservice teachers and the middle school students benefited from the experience. Follow-up surveys indicated that almost every middle school student in the class had a desire to read the novel. This project shows we can enrich and enhance preservice teachers’ preparation and middle school students’  learning by finding ways to think about the application of literature in mathematical courses or even the application of mathematics in literature. ,80,mtms2007-10-134a,,
