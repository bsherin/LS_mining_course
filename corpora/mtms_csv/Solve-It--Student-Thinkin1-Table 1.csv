10,Solve It: Student Thinking: Tom versus Tom,"Submissions from three of the four teachers highlighted here showed that this task promoted teachers’ and students’ use of technology. The task also generated rich conversations regarding statistics. The students in the classes of Walter Stark, Jill M. Schauland, and Rebecca Layton used the Internet to search for box office data, awards won, and even social media fans. Schauland reported that her sixth-grade students enjoyed accessing the Internet to find information and “utilizing technology in their presentation.” In fact, the boys in Schauland’s class “decided to switch it up a bit and selected two NBA athletes, turning the project into a ‘Kevin versus Kevin.’ ” This change forced the students to think about which stats they should compare. The numbers they chose resulted in a clear-cut winner because Kevin Durant’s stats were better in every category than Kevin Love’s stats. (See fig. 1’s slides from the boys’ presentation.)

These  websites provided information on box office receipts and awards won and listed all the movies each actor had made. Her students also explored other sites for more information. While researching the various areas, students shared their ideas electronically with classmates through Google Docs. Layton reported that— through this assignment I have experienced all the benefits of Google Docs. It has been so nice to see their progress at anytime and be able to give comments and feedback at anytime. It is a great way to give writing assignments.

It is interesting to note that another group of students in Layton’s class used a box-and-whisker plot that was similar to that produced by Lena and Natalie to support Hanks. A third group of students used the same data to support Cruise. The difference in these students’ arguments came down to discussing the range of earnings, highest earnings, or total revenues for movies versus the median and even third quartile revenues of each actor’s movies.

Also the number of Emmys, Academy awards and golden globes could help determine how accomplished an actor is. To begin, Tom Hanks has been wildly successful and is worth over 350 million dollars (personal proﬁ ts) and his box ofﬁ ce proﬁ ts have made over 8.3 billion dollars. Also he has been in over 46 movies since the 1980’s and has received 5 Emmy awards, 2 Academy awards and 4 Golden Globes overall. Tom Hanks is a very accomplished actor! Adding on, Tom Cruise is a well known actor and is worth 250 million dollars. He has been in over 36 movies since the early 1980’s and has received 2 Academy Awards and 3 Golden Globes but no Emmys but overall he is a very successful actor!
