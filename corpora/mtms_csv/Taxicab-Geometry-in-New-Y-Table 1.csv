0,Taxicab Geometry in New York City - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In taxicab geometry, distances are measured along paths of horizontal and vertical lines. Diagonal paths are not allowed. This measurement simulates the movement of taxicabs, which can travel only on streets, never through buildings. The length of the shortest path from A to B is called the taxicab distance from A to B. To find a taxicab distance, one can trace paths from A to B using grid lines and moving horizontally and vertically but not diagonally. (Teacher note: A grid, available for student use, is with the online solutions.)",,
1,Taxicab Geometry in New York City - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,A taxi driver has a passenger who wants to go from the 42nd Street / Port Authority Bus Terminal to  Rockefeller Center in New York City. The taxi driver wants to go to Rockefeller Center along the shortest path to save gas. What is the shortest distance if every block is 1 mile?,,
2,Taxicab Geometry in New York City - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"1. If the 42nd Street / Port Authority Bus Terminal is located at A (1, 3) and Rockefeller Center is located at B (3, 10), what is your taxicab distance from A to B?",,
3,Taxicab Geometry in New York City - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,2. Compare your paths and those of your classmates. Are the distances always the same? What is the length of the shortest possible path from A to B? Is there more than  1 shortest path? The shortest path is called the taxicab distance.,,
4,Taxicab Geometry in New York City - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"3. Use a centimeter ruler. If we did not have to follow the roads, what is the shortest distance (the Euclidean distance) from A to B? Measure to the nearest tenth of a mile (tenth of an inch). If you know the Pythagorean theorem, use it to find the distance. Which is greater, the taxicab distance from A to B or the Euclidean distance?",,
5,Taxicab Geometry in New York City - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"4. Challenge: Write a general formula for the taxicab distance from  A (x1, y1) to B (x2, y2).",,
