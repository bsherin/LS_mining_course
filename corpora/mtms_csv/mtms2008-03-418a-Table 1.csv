"Supermarkets often list sale prices in terms of how many items for how much. For example, recently I saw that Snickers bars were advertised at 8 bars for $3 and cans of SpaghettiOs were selling at 4 for $5. Are those good prices? How much is it if I buy only one bar or can? The price of one bar or one can is called the unit price. One way to think about unit price in the setting of these sale prices is to think about fraction-to-percent equivalents. This article describes instructional activities designed to help students develop both an understanding of, and mental math abilities for, the multiple relationships that exist among fractions and percents and unit prices.

Another method that is commonly used for converting a fraction to a percent is to find the equivalent fraction that has a denominator of 100. This method reveals more about the meaning of percent, or per centum, “centum” being Latin for 100, which can be interpreted as “out of 100” or “of 100.”",12,mtms2008-03-418a,,

"Using a 10 × 10 square array, or blank hundreds chart, to represent percents is not a new idea. One common practice is to have students discover that 1/4 is equal to 25 percent by shading 1/4 ",15,mtms2008-03-418a,,
"Fig. 1 Two ways to mark 1 out of 4 of the hundreds chart and counting the shaded small squares. This model relies on the understanding of fractions as part of the whole. However, a less common way to work with fraction-topercent conversions on a blank hundreds chart may be more beneficial to students trying to understand percent. It is based on the meaning of a fraction as a part of a set. Using the part-of-aset meaning of fractions, 1/4 can be thought of as being 1 out of a group of 4. With that idea in mind, students can begin to learn about the meaning of percents by representing fractions on blank hundreds charts. Students can be given large hundreds charts on which they can place counters to mark squares or they can use smaller hundreds charts that they can color with a pen or pencil. ",16,mtms2008-03-418a,,
"After writing 1/4 on the board, ask  students what that number means. One common answer is that 1/4 means 1 out of a group of 4. Challenge students to mark 1 out of every group of 4 squares on a hundreds chart and then ask them how many squares they marked. When students work on problems like these, it is not likely that all students will mark the same pattern of squares. One typical pattern that students use is found by counting left to right and placing a mark on every fourth square. (See fig. 1a.) Another  a good understanding of percents.

Few, if any, tell me that 1/3 is equal to 33 1/3 percent.

"Any proper fraction with a denominator less than or equal to 100 can be converted into a percent using this method. A way to begin is to have students first work with fractions that result in whole-number percents, for example, 1/5, 1/4, 1/2, and 3/4. Once students are familiar with the process, challenge them to convert fractions that will not result in a whole-number percent, for example, 1/8. Students will usually place 1 marker for every 8 squares, only to discover that 4 squares remain (shown in green in fig. 2). (A total of 12 markers or squares account for 96 of the 100 squares, with 4 remaining.) When you ask students what they found, do not be surprised if their response is that they used 12 markers but ended up with some extra squares. Other students will add that they put 1/2 into the 4 remaining squares. When asked why, they may not be able  thinking",21,mtms2008-03-418a,,

"However, it is sometimes important for students to have quick recall of, or the ability to mentally compute, percent equivalents. Working with derived percents, that is, unknown percent equivalents derived from known percent equivalents, will help students develop their mental math abilities as well as learn how to work with fraction-to-percent equivalents. In other words, students can be led to discover that through simple reasoning, one example of a percent can lead to another. For example, consider that a student knows that 1/2 is 50 percent but cannot recall the percent equivalent of 1/4. When the student focuses on the relationship between the frac- to explain it as easily as they intuitively saw the relationship. However, after some thinking, they are likely to conclude that because 4 squares is 1/2 of 8 squares, the 4 squares get 1/2 of a mark instead of 1 full mark. After discussion and guidance, most students will agree that 1 out of 8 is the same as 12 1/2 out of 100 and that 1/8 is equal to  12 1/2 percent.",25,mtms2008-03-418a,,

"The blank hundreds chart can be used for finding any fraction-to-percent equivalent for fractions with denomi× nators equal to or less than 100. Once students become experienced with the hundreds chart, they can be challenged to think about less common fraction-to-percent conversions using mental math. For example, take the fraction 1/9. A student will think that 11 markers would account for 99 of the 100 squares, with 1 square remaining. That 1 square would receive 1/9 of a marker, so 1/9 =  11  1/9 percent. By the way, using derived percents, 1/9 is 1/3 of 1/3,  and 1/3 of 33  1/3 percent is 11  1/9 percent. Another example is 1/12. When marking 1 of every 12 squares, 8 marks account for 96 of the 100 squares, with 4 squares remaining. Those 4 squares would receive 1/3 of a mark, so 1/12 is equivalent to 8  1/3 percent. What about 1/11? Nine markers would account for 99 of the squares with 1 left over, so 1/11 is the same as 9  1/11 percent. What about 3/11? It would be three times 9  1/11 percent, which is 27  3/11 percent. This way of thinking is relatively simple, but it provides a context and a challenge for student to hone their mental math abilities.  unit PRices",34,mtms2008-03-418a,,
"Once students develop some fluency with fraction and percent equivalents, analyzing unit pricing is a logical next step.

"There are many possible derived percents. To find the percent equivalent of 1/8, one possibility is to think that 1/8 is 1/2 of 1/4 and that 1/2 of 25 percent is 12 1/2 percent, therefore, 1/8 = 12 1/2 percent. Figure 3 gives students the opportunity to work with these relationships and record their thinking to share with classmates and teachers. Challenge the students to find the percent equivalents using the two givens as they record their thinking. Students will find it interesting to compare their thinking with that  33 16 16 advertisement can provide the basis for many unit price conversion tasks. Ask students to figure out how much they would pay for a Snickers candy bar that is on sale at 8 bars for $3.00. You may need to prompt them to think about what fraction represents the price of one bar. After some thought and discussion, they will understand that 8 bars for $3.00 can be represented as 3/8 (3 dollars for 8 bars). Then using their knowledge of fraction-to-percent equivalents, they are not far from arriving at the solution that each bar cost would cost 37  1/2 cents (if they buy all 8 bars; 38 cents if they buy only 1 bar) because 3/8 is 37  1/2 percent and 37  1/2 percent of a dollar is 37  1/2 cents. As another example, the same store advertised 4 cans of SpaghettiOs for $5. What is the price of 1 can? Students can think of 5/4 being the same as 1  1/4, which equals 125 percent, so each can sells for $1.25.
