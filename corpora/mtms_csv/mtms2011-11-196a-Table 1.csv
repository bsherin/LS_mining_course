Teaching to Intuition,47,mtms2011-11-196a,,
"Edric Cane iI became acquainted with the teaching of mathematics in America as a parent, through my children and the homework they brought home. I immediately picked up on a distinctly American flavor of what it means to learn and to know math. It was much later, long after I became a math teacher myself, that I was able to figure out and articulate a pattern that best described that particular flavor and that explained my concerns.",48,mtms2011-11-196a,,
"I will mention only one example. My children were being tested on a formula for the perimeter of rectangles, something I had never heard of in that context. To refer to a formula seemed to be an invitation to bypass the elementary thinking process that leads from understanding to knowledge. In contrast, as a teacher, I do not ask my students to memorize most formulas. Whenever possible, I help them acquire the thinking tools that allow them to recreate the mathematics as needed. For instance, for the time-distance formula, I ask them to give me a time-distance problem and then prod them for a simpler example. We may end up with this: ",49,mtms2011-11-196a,,

"In the problem, 2 hours is the time, 60 mph is the rate, and 120 miles is the distance. The concrete example and manageable numbers give immediate access to the formula, if it is needed. The simple numbers in the example also help clarify the relationship among the three variables in ways that often allow students to dispense with a formula. Introducing a formula as an intermediate step is unteaching more than it is teaching. It contributes to creating a perception of mathematics as being an accumulation of facts instead of a subject that involves a creative use of the mind. ",52,mtms2011-11-196a,,
"In the same context, let’s look at the solution to a simple rate problem that is found in a widely used textbook (see fig. 1). It is an example of mathematics that could be taught using some degree of mental activity; instead, it is entrusted to a memorized  procedure—the time-distance formula and mechanical substitution. ",53,mtms2011-11-196a,,
"As a teacher, I have become aware  that what struck me as a parent and what constantly surfaces in our textbooks and practices are not what we intend to do, as illustrated by the efforts and approaches implemented in any number of classrooms, in professional conferences, and in NCTM publications. We want to emphasize understanding, creativity, and multiple approaches. For many students, however, something gets in the way that prevents them from relying on actively using their brains. We promote foundational learning, but at some deeper level, we are banning it from what it means to know mathematics.",54,mtms2011-11-196a,,
"A simple experience helped clarify in my mind what that obstacle might be. I was sitting in on a geometry class taught by an excellent teacher, who is open to activities in which students discover, visualize, and manipulate as needed. The topic was the angle-angle similarity theorem of triangles. At one point, I interjected, “If two, then three” as a way to remind students that all three angles are congruent even though we only need to prove congruency for two of the angles. The teacher concurred. She said: “Yes, there’s a theorem.” We agreed, so why did I feel such a strong objection to her statement? The teacher’s comment implied that the knowledge expressed by “If two, then three” was entrusted to the memory of a theorem.",55,mtms2011-11-196a,,
"I felt the knowledge could and  should be safely entrusted to elementary reasoning: knowing the sum of the three angles. Referring to a theorem in the circumstances was no better than relying on a formula to fi nd a perimeter. I became aware of a sentiment that I had not been able to articulate previously: Mathematical knowledge does not appear to be validated until it can be entrusted to a formula, a theorem, a rule, an algo-",56,mtms2011-11-196a,,
"We devise activities that contribute to understanding and use that understanding to explain the rules, but we do not allow the understanding to substitute for the rules.",57,mtms2011-11-196a,,
"As an illustration of teaching to  intuition, let’s use operations on fractions. If known as a collection of rules, fractions are bound to be a nightmare for many students, including some who are in remedial math classes in college. We devise activities that contribute to understanding and use that understanding to explain the rules, but we do not allow the understanding to substitute for the rules. Without implying that there is only one way of teaching operations on fractions, let me suggest a way to help students internalize the logic behind adding and subtracting fractions that have a common denominator and the need for a common denominator when they do not have one. First, I ask my students three important questions: rithm, or a formal defi nition. That, it seems, is what it means to know mathematics. Until then, I thought that the different strategies I used to teach math worked successfully on their individual merit. This experience helped me realize that all the strategies had something in common: I trusted mathematical knowledge to students’ intimate conviction—and worked very hard to deserve that trust. I called the approach “teaching to intuition.” •  What is 5 dogs and 3 dogs? •  What is 5 cats and 3 cats? •  What is 5 dogs and 3 cats?",58,mtms2011-11-196a,,
"This last question elicits some initial confusion and a variety of answers. One student always suggests “8 pets.” We make it our common answer and discuss what went on in their minds as they answered the question. “Why the hesitation? Why not 8 dogs?” In the end, students explain that we can ",59,mtms2011-11-196a,,

We make a diagram of the process that changed dogs and cats into pets, added the pets, and assigned that answer to the initial question. The students recognize that this is something that they have always done and always known, even though they may never have thought about it before. At that point, the understanding is transferred to fractions. The ease experienced with the fi rst two questions, the initial confusion when the third question is asked, and the strategy used to overcome the diffi culty are shown in fi gure 2. My aim is to transfer not only the knowledge of the similarity but also the experience and the emotion of that situation. My hope is for that experience to substitute for memorized rules.",70,mtms2011-11-196a,,
"Supplying additional connections can help buttress the understanding. For example, numerator means number, as in numerous; denominator means name as in to nominate. A fraction is written with two numbers, but the denominator is read and written as a noun. We initially ask students not to simplify “5 eighths + 3 eighths = 1,” which detracts from the full logic of addition. From then on, as the need occurs, students are reminded of the experience and the understanding instead of the rules. If they hesitate, I may say: “What’s 2 books and 3 ",71,mtms2011-11-196a,,

"In contrast, those aha! moments show students reconnecting with the power of their brains and intuition. For many, such an experience redefi nes what it means to know math. It teaches them that mathematics is something that they own, an extension of their inner quest for meaning and understanding, that there is no math that is independent of an active thinking process. Much of our expectations and approaches as a profession point to that direction; unfortunately, for too many students, knowledge is highjacked by procedures. It does not have to be that way.
