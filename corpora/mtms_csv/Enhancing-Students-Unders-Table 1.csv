0,Enhancing Students Understanding of Square Roots - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Students enrolled in a middle school prealgebra or algebra course often struggle to conceptualize and understand the meaning of radical notation when it is introduced. For example, although it is important for students to approximate the decimal value of a number such as  and estimate the value of a square root in the form of , many would struggle with such assignments. Similarly, students frequently have difficulties understanding, remembering, and applying the properties of radicals.",,
1,Enhancing Students Understanding of Square Roots - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"As a result, I developed an engaging and interactive activity to improve studentsâ€™ knowledge of this foundational mathematical principle. This activity provides an opportunity for students to strengthen their number sense and their ability to estimate, which are skills valued by the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSM), NCTM Standards, and local curricula. To be sure, CCSSM standards for eighth-grade mathematics include truncating the decimal expansion of a square root, comparing the size of irrational numbers with rational numbers, and locating an irrational number on a number line (CCSSI 2010).",,
2,Enhancing Students Understanding of Square Roots - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Students enjoy this lesson because it includes a competitive component, which often enhances student motivation (Silver, Strong, and Parini 1997). By using an innovative technique to develop studentsâ€™ conceptual understanding of radicals, I am also able to promote situational interest and, therefore, improve studentsâ€™ intrinsic motivation to learn (Linnenbrink and Pintrich 2002). Finally, this activity can be used to provide additional practice, feedback, and clarification, which can all help to develop more efficacious students (Margolis and McCabe 2004).",,
3,Enhancing Students Understanding of Square Roots - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"To begin the activity, the teacher should post and discuss perfect squares and radical expressions that simplify to whole numbers, such as",,

5,Enhancing Students Understanding of Square Roots - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The class can then use these examples to estimate the value of  without using a calculator. The teacher asks the students to consider the fact that  is between  and, as a result, the estimated value is somewhere between 5 and 6. Since  is closer to , students conjecture that the estimated value should be closer to 5 than 6. After initiating a discussion regarding how close it should be to 5, a reasonable approximation, rounded to the hundredths, could be a value such as 5.32. At this time, it would also be beneficial to discuss rational versus irrational numbers and mathematical precision.",,
6,Enhancing Students Understanding of Square Roots - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The precision of a result depends on the context of the problem (CCSSI 2010). For example, an estimated value of  to the nearest tenth would likely suffice for a builder who is needing to temporarily brace a wall with a diagonal support beam while building a house. However, an engineer who is designing a bridge would likely have to be more precise and, consequently, would want a more exact value of  with all calculations carried out to additional places after the decimal point. Furthermore, it would also be beneficial to discuss using an exact value of  versus a rounded value such as 5.32 with different types of contextualized problems. If a word problem required you to multiply 25,000 by , for instance, using the approximated value would give a much different result than if using the exact value (133,000 versus 132,288).",,
7,Enhancing Students Understanding of Square Roots - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The activity works best with about eight to ten groups. However, depending on the size of the class, teachers can place students into groups of two or three. If instructors would like to ensure that individual students are held accountable, they can require each student to complete work on a separate piece of paper, to be collected at the end of the session. See figure 1 for an example of student work that can elicit classroom discussions.",,

9,Enhancing Students Understanding of Square Roots - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The main objectives of the lesson are to build number sense and enhance studentsâ€™ understanding of square roots, so it is important for the teacher to discuss each of the three steps with the class. Step 1 requires that students become familiar with perfect squares and get a sense of the value of . It also gives students a visual: Students can see that 28 is only three units from 25 versus eight units from 36. The teacher can create a number line with step 2 and, on the basis of the information discussed in step 1, ask students where we might place a point on the line to represent . For the final step, the teacher can discuss why the point would be closer to 5 on the number line and then ask students to estimate. After soliciting an approximated value from a student, the teacher could square it to identify the accuracy of the estimated value and demonstrate the relationship between squares and square roots. I would discuss several similar examples with the class and then expect students to continue with the assignment.",,
10,Enhancing Students Understanding of Square Roots - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"This activity is best accomplished when students work together and agree on their answer. Student discussions have been interesting and lively. For instance, students often debate why an estimated value should be closer to one whole number versus another or they will quickly square their approximated number to check for accuracy.",,
11,Enhancing Students Understanding of Square Roots - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Give students a minute or two to complete the problem. Once each team has an estimate, ask one group member to write their answer, rounded to the hundredths place, on the board under his or her teamâ€™s name. After all teams have their answer on the board, the teacher can discuss the problem and provide the truncated decimal value. The team that is closest to that value earns 3 points; the second closest earns 2 points; and the third closest is awarded 1 point. Repeat this procedure with roughly six to eight problems, and whichever team has the most points at the end can win a prize that is deemed appropriate by the teacher.",,
12,Enhancing Students Understanding of Square Roots - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"This activity, which takes approximately thirty minutes to complete, is best to incorporate soon after introducing radicals. Teachers can also increase the difficulty level by incorporating questions in which students must apply the properties of radicals. For instance, teachers can include problems that require students to multiply, add, subtract, and divide square roots or estimate radicals in the form of . With figure 2â€™s expressions, students can first condense the problem to a single radical before estimating the value. These are only a few examples of the types of problems a teacher could include. It is important to expose students to a variety of radical expressions and to scaffold the difficulty level.",,

14,Enhancing Students Understanding of Square Roots - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"When a teacher asks students to approximate , it can spark a discussion regarding equivalent expressions and the benefits of keeping it in that form versus rewriting it to . Although some learners may prefer one form over another when approximating the value, the idea is to discuss different mathematical approaches as a way to enhance comprehension.",,
15,Enhancing Students Understanding of Square Roots - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In conclusion, students have benefited from this activity because they have typically gained a better understanding of the concept of radicals and have been more likely to conceptualize square roots. Students have mentioned that the use of a number line, especially if several expressions are shown",,

17,Enhancing Students Understanding of Square Roots - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"has helped them connect square roots with the relative size of the numbers because it improves their ability to compare irrational numbers with rational numbers. Students are also able to see the relationship between squaring a number and finding its square root. For example, one student stated, â€œI now see how it goes both ways. When you take the square root of 20, you get 4.47, and when you square 4.47, you get 20.â€ Another student summarized one component of the lesson by stating, â€œThe radical is just a way to represent square roots, right?â€",,
18,Enhancing Students Understanding of Square Roots - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I thought it was important to be more precise with the first studentâ€™s language. Therefore, I discussed how we get a truncated value of 4.47 when we take the square root of 20, and since 4.47 is an approximated value, we get a number close to 20 when we square it. Nevertheless, this activity has always engaged my students because they must be active participants, and they generally enjoy the competition. This activity not only strengthens studentsâ€™ estimation skills for use in subsequent lessons but also solidifies understanding of the key concepts of radical notation and square roots.",,
