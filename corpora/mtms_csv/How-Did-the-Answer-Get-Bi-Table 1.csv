Consider a statement made by a sixth grader during a discussion of the problem 12 ÷ 3/4. Together the students and their teacher were drawing a picture to determine how many 3/4 were in 12 (see fi g. 1). Finding how many groups of a particular size (3/4) are in an initial quantity (12) is the measurement interpretation of division. When the class arrived at the solution 16, or that 16 groups of 3/4 were in 12, a dismayed student said, “No offense, but how did the number get bigger?”",3,How Did the Answer Get Bigger?
