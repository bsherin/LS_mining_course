Investigating Students’ Thinking about Functional Relationships hHow do your students perform when  you ask them to compare linear and nonlinear relationships? Do they use process-oriented (procedural) approaches or object-oriented (structural) approaches? Can they integrate the two? Are those who connect process and object perspectives more successful in comparing functional relationships?,2,mtms2007-12-312a,,
"Functional relationships are one of the most powerful concepts in mathematics and a common occurrence in real-life situations (Romberg, Fennema, and Carpenter 1993). The NCTM’s Algebra Standard for grades 6–8 emphasizes that all students should “identify functions as linear or nonlinear and contrast their properties from tables, graphs, or equations” (NCTM 2000,  p. 222). According to Moschkovich, Schoenfeld, and Arcavi (1993), flexibility to move between process and object perspectives is a hallmark of competence. This capacity involves the ability to “ ‘see’ lines [graphs] in the plane, in their algebraic form . . . as objects . . . but also to switch to the process perspective (in which an x value of the function ‘produces’ a y value), where the perspective is appropriate” (p. 97). Studying functional relationships in middle schools lays a firm foundation for more formal study of functions in high school.  the task: Patio PatteRns",3,mtms2007-12-312a,,
"In Patio Pattern (fig. 1), students are asked to investigate the functional relationship of (1) the number of rows of stones to the total number of bricks and (2) the number of rows of stones to the total number of stones. The relationship between the number of rows of stones, n, and the total number of bricks, B, is linear and can be generalized as B = 8n. The total number of stones, S, is more complex in that it represents a quadratic relationship, which can be generalized as S = n2. The focus of this article is to compare these two functional relationships, especially in terms of their growth rate, and to share examples of the thinking of middle school students and undergraduate teacher education majors who completed the task. You are invited to “take time for action” and investigate your students’ thinking on this task. (It is recommended that instructors have students search for the algebraic rules themselves rather than providing this information, as occurs in task 3 in fig. 1.)  student PeRfoRMance",4,mtms2007-12-312a,,

"adults tended to use similar strategies to generalize the relations, that is, process-oriented rather than objectoriented approaches. However, adults were more apt to use object-oriented  strategies, as well.",12,mtms2007-12-312a,,
"The functional relationship under comparison is B = 8n and S = n2. Most students who used process-oriented approaches simply calculated the   values for B and S that correspond  to n = 0, 1, 3, 4, and so on, then compared the values of B and S for a random large n. This strategy treats the functions as processes. One seventh grader’s “process-oriented” comment was as follows: “The number of stones will increase faster. I know this because I took a random higher number and saw that the stones will be increasing faster.” This student, Amy, chose 10 for n and plugged this value into n2 and 8n (see fig. 2).",13,mtms2007-12-312a,,
"In other cases, students plugged each n into 8n and n2, calculated the values for both, and organized the data into a table. They compared the values of 8n and n2, then made conclusions about the growth rate. For example, Stacey, an eighth grader, calculated the value of B and S for n from 1 to 9. She organized the data into a table (fig. 3) and predicted that “after the halfway mark (8 × 8) [that is, when n > 8], all the numbers of stones afterward will be larger [than the number of bricks].” ",14,mtms2007-12-312a,,
"The adults used similar strate- gies. For example, Tom calculated the  fig. 4 Process-oriented approach using computation and a search for patterns from Tom, an adult fig. 5 A process-oriented graphical approach from Shelley, an adult values for 8n and n2 starting from n = 9, organized the results into a table, and explained his approach as follows: “Since we determined that with 8 rows, there will be an equal number of stones and bricks, we can begin a ‘testing method’ starting with 9 rows. We see that the number of stones increases by 19, then 21, then 23, while the number of bricks increases by 8 with each added row. Therefore, we know that the number of stones increases more quickly.” Although his table (fig. 4) at first appears similar to Stacey’s (fig. 3), closer inspection of his table and explanations reveals that he came to his conclusion by finding the differences between each row for both the stones and the bricks, a strategy that is deemed to be process oriented. In some cases, students used process/object approaches. The comparison of linear and nonlinear relationships was characterized as process/object by virtue of the systematic, entity-oriented approaches that connected procedures. Examples of process/object comments included this one from a seventh grader: “Stones grow faster because you are multiplying the number of rows by number of rows. So it goes up really fast while the number of bricks is increasing linearly and stones are by unequal amounts.” Here, the two functions are treated as objects, that is, 8n is “increasing linearly” and n2 is increasing “by unequal amounts.” The explanation “[n2] goes up really fast” served as a statement that links one object to another. Although this student seemed to have difficulty articulating n2 as a quadratic function, she nevertheless realized that the bricks increased linearly. Meanwhile, the fact that she described the number of stones as “multiplying the number of rows by number of rows” demonstrates her understanding with respect to the process. More adults than middle school students used process/object strategies. Some adults were able to articulate the pattern of stones and bricks using correct mathematics terminology; for example, “Stones increase quadratically while the bricks increase linearly.” In this explanation, the two functions are treated as entities, and the object approach is used with procedural understanding.",15,mtms2007-12-312a,,
"One adult, Shelly, was the only person who used a graphical approach to find the growth rate for the two functions (see fig. 5). The line for bricks and a curve for stones were treated as two entities. Shelly incorporated a process-oriented perspective as well by noting that 8 is the intersection.  iMPlications foR teaching",16,mtms2007-12-312a,,
"In general, most students used process-oriented strategies to interpret the algebraic relationship. Neither middle school students nor adults showed a strong ability to move flexibly between process-oriented and object-oriented understandings of functional relationships. The activity discussed in this article is one way to assess students’ thinking about this topic. Teachers can expose students to tasks that require them to think about various functional relationships, such as comparing and interpreting linear and quadratic relationships or linear and exponential patterns. Teachers should also encourage students to express their thinking about important characteristics of these linear and nonlinear relationships.",17,mtms2007-12-312a,,
"Note the strategies that students use  when they investigate functional relationships. Do they see functions more as processes or objects? Can they move flexibly between process and object perspectives of functions? Kieran (1991) notes, “The challenge to classroom instruction is to . . . develop the abilities to move back and forth between the  procedural [process] and structural [object] conceptions [of functions] and see the advantages of being able to choose one perspective or the other—depending on the task at hand” (p. 252). If most students view functional relationships as procedures and processes, then instructional practices might be modified to help students acquire an object perspective, as well. ",18,mtms2007-12-312a,,
"Only one student (an adult) was able to use a graphical approach to solve the task. Principles and Standards for School Mathematics (NCTM 2000) advocates that students from grades 6 to 8 be able to “represent, analyze, and generalize a variety of patterns with tables, graphs, words, and, when possible, symbolic rules” (p. 222). Thus, teachers should use graphical representations to explain functional relationships, introducing both process perspectives to plot and interpret graphs and object perspectives to examine those graphs. Teachers are  encouraged to use this activity as one way to explore students’ skills in finding and representing functional relationships.",19,mtms2007-12-312a,,
