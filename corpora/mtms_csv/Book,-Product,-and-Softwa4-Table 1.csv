12,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (October 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","The offering 100 Essential Things is a delightful book crammed full of interesting connections between math and art. Author John D. Barrow explains that one way of thinking about mathematics is as the catalogue of all possible patterns. With this broad description of mathematics, he connects math to all types of art.",,
13,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (October 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","These snapshots of 100 essential things touch on familiar topics, such as the golden ratio, Fibonacci numbers, and fractals. Barrow also looks at some unusual places where math and art connections can be found. He explores how many individuals are needed to guard an art gallery; why everyone sounds good singing in the shower; Shakespeares vocabulary (numbering 66,534 words); Albrecht Drers picture Melencolia I and its magic square; the ski-jump ramp enabling heavier aircraft to take off from shorter runways on an aircraft carrier; how Salvador Dali represented the fourth dimension in his painting, Corpus Hypercubus; where to stand to look at a statue; how to reduce the amount of light coming in a window without using drapes; why El Greco painted humans with unusual elongation; and how lacing patterns have played an important historical role in dresses and bodices.",,
14,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (October 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics",The author lures you into further research by presenting these 100 fascinating and fun tidbits connecting mathematics and the arts.

20,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (October 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","In Planting the Seeds of Algebra, Monica Neagoy explores four areas of elementary mathematics that are essential for developing the foundation for algebraic reasoning. She provides actual lessons that have been taught in elementary classrooms in the areas of geometry, patterns and functions, multiplication and the distributive property, and fractions. She then makes connections between elementary mathematics and secondary algebra. She concludes each exploration with suggestions for extending the lesson beyond the scope of the text.",,
21,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (October 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","This book does an excellent job of presenting the four classroom lessons, including student questions and responses. The appendix provides the worksheets used for each lesson. Although this book is meant for the lower middle grades, the multiplication and distributive property chapters provide additional reinforcement to higher middle-grades students who still struggle in those areas.",,
22,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (October 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Overall, I found the book to be interesting and insightful. Any preservice teacher or new in-service teacher would find the detail of the lessons useful and able to help generate ideas for planning lessons about other concepts.",,

39,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (October 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Matt Parker includes historical mathematical facts, tricks, puzzles, jokes, and games to show that mathematics is not boring. He says that most students are unexcited about mathematics. Acknowledging the mathematics education reform journey would have painted a fairer picture.",,
40,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (October 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","The book appeals to Kgrade 12 students as well as college students and adults. In the Can You Digit? chapter, Parker discusses the 37 trick, which involves choosing a digit, writing it three times, and dividing the resulting number by the sum of the digits. The result is always 37.",,
41,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (October 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Parker sometimes covers too many ideas instead of focusing on a few in depth. For example, he compares the 37 trick with the Roman, Babylonian, and Maya numeration systems but omits a comparison of these systems with the Hindu-Arabic system. In the Number Mash-ups chapter, it may have been more powerful to delve into one or two functions in greater detail instead of discussing four functions. Also, in exploring the Fibonacci sequence, Parker omits the Rabbit problem, which generates the sequence. He could also have said more about the golden ratio and the generation of Mersenne numbers.",,
42,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (October 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","The book inspires one to want to learn more mathematics or simply revisit mathematics. For example, in Number Mash-Ups, Parker explains the limit of a sum by connecting with a mathematics joke. He also discusses how a problem in a PlayStation4 video game was caused by rounding rules. Parkers historical references, such as the growth of mathematics between what the Greeks accomplished and the sixteenth century, are attractive. Teachers could use the book to enhance students understanding and views, in general, about mathematics.",,
