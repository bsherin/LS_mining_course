22,Error-Eliciting Problems: Fostering Understanding and Thinking,"Many students, and even some adults, believe that multiplication always “makes bigger” and division always “makes smaller,” in part because of their experience with multipliers and divisors being natural numbers. For example, 78 percent of students ages 12 and 13 circled less in this statement: “The answer to 4.6 ÷ 0.6 is more/less than 4.6” (Greer 1987). Multiple-choice items can be used to elicit the multiplication makes bigger (MMB) and division makes smaller (DMS) misconceptions (Lim 2011). The items are effective only if students do not perform the actual calculations, which might give correct answers without students understanding the underlying ideas. The purpose here is for students to reason about  the effect of multiplying or dividing by a proper fraction. To deter students from performing the computation, the problem in figure 1a uses “ugly” fractions, so that students can think about the effect of dividing by 2884/3717. Figure 1b uses a variable so that students can think about the effect of the multiplier 67/89 on any natural number. ",22,Error-Eliciting Problems: Fostering Understanding and Thinking
23,Error-Eliciting Problems: Fostering Understanding and Thinking,"Both items were found in a lesson that uses clickers and visuals with PowerPoint® slides to help prospective teachers address the MMB and DMS misconceptions (Lim 2011). Twentytwo of 35 college students in a math course for prospective teachers initially selected “less than” for the first item, but the correct answer is “greater than.” This mistake revealed a common assumption that the dividend should be divided into equal parts. In this case, the sharing-equally model of division is inappropriate because the divisor is not a whole number. To visualize and understand the meaning of dividing by a proper fraction, these prospective teachers needed the measurement model of division, in which division is modeled by showing the number of times the divisor fits into the dividend.

24,Error-Eliciting Problems: Fostering Understanding and Thinking,"For the second item (see fig. 1b),  only 13 prospective teachers chose the correct answer A. When asked to explain why the inequality is always true, some prospective teachers gave empirical justification; for example, they tried several values of N and found that the inequality was true each time. Some gave a more conceptual explanation; for example, a fraction value of N is going to be less than the number N itself. The two problems in figure 1 give learners an opportunity to make mistakes and discuss their thinking. Such discussions can help them understand the meaning of multiplying by a proper fraction (e.g., part of something or scaling down) and dividing by a proper fraction (e.g., a proper fraction can fit into N units more than N times).

To elicit the graphs-as-pictures misconception, we can use problems like figure 2, in which a scenario is described and students are supposed to select the distance-time graph that best represents the scenario. Students who select graph B tend to interpret the graph as a picture that represents the hill on which Kula jogged. The correct answer is A, and there are different ways to justify it.

28,Error-Eliciting Problems: Fostering Understanding and Thinking,"Mathematical learning involves developing both procedural knowledge and conceptual knowledge. However, procedures can be learned and practiced without connections, meanings, or conceptual understanding. The sequential nature of procedure lends itself to rote learning, which “produces knowledge that is notably absent in relationships and is tied closely to the context in which it is learned” (Hiebert and Lefevre 1986, p. 9). Problems can be designed to elicit and address common errors associated with a formula or procedure that is learned superfi cially. The problem in fi gure 3 is designed specifi cally to elicit a misapplication of the speedequals-distance-over-time formula. When this question was administered in a pretest, only 18 percent of 307 prospective elementary teachers chose the correct answer choice B; 52 percent chose D because at 20 minutes, the distance from home is 3000 meters and dividing 3000 meters by 20 minutes gives 150 meters/minute.

They could have arrived at the correct answer by converting the percentages to decimals (i.e., 0.45 × 0.02) or to fractions (45/100 × 2/100). Alternatively, we could treat the percent sign as a “unit” with a value of 0.01 or 1/100. This interpretation allows students to conceptualize 45% × 2% as 45 × 0.01 × 2 × 0.01. Such reasoning can be connected to the more familiar concept related to area, such as the notion of square meters. For example, a length of 45 m times a width of 2 m will result in an area of 90 m2.
