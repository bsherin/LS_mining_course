"I am responding to “Putting the Right Spin on Student Work,” by Robert E. Ely and Jessica Strowbridge Cohen (November 2010 issue, pp. 208–15). I am a preservice teacher and had  originally worked on their spinner problem in my math education class. We were asked to select and respond to an article, and I chose this one. The question—“What spinner design do you think is best?”—was intriguing, and I saw it as a challenge. (This article was especially meaningful to me, because one of the authors was a professor who helped me develop an appreciation for math, specifically, probability.) ",1,mtms2011-08-7a,,
"I began by trying to build a spinner so that each sum from 2–8 had an equal chance of occurring. To do this, I needed to find out what the probability of each sum would be, so I found 1/7 = 14.3% (7 represented the number of sums; 2–8). From this, I figured that the ideal spinner would give each sum occurring in two spins a 14.8 percent chance. From here, I had two thoughts. Use a spinner— 1.  with four numbers (1–4) so that a  possible sum could not exceed 8; or 2.  that included five numbers, which would increase the probability of getting a 7 or 8 but also potentially create a sum greater than 8 (9 or 10).",2,mtms2011-08-7a,,
"I first worked with the four-sector  spinner (see fig. 1a). I found that to increase the chance of getting a 2 or 8 (sums that were not as likely because they had fewer addends than the other sums—1 + 1 and 4 + 4, respectively), ",3,mtms2011-08-7a,,

I configured my four-sector spinner with the 1 and 4 each taking up 1/3 of the space and the 2 and 3 each taking up 1/6 of the space. The benefit of using this spinner was that the majority of the sums was close to the 14.8 percent benchmark (see table 1); however, a sum of 5 had almost a 30 percent chance of occurring, which is quite high.",7,mtms2011-08-7a,,
"I had two thoughts about the  five-sector spinner: Make the 5 sector larger to increase the chance of getting a sum of 8 or make it smaller to decrease the chance of getting a sum of 9 or 10. I tried both ways. With spinner 2, the 5 sector used 1/8 of the available space (see fig. 1b); spinner 3 used 1/12 of the space (see fig. 1c).",8,mtms2011-08-7a,,
"Of the three spinners, spinner 2 is the best. Compared with spinner 3, you are sacrificing about 1 percent from the sum of 8 to the sum of 9 or 10, but the rest of the probabilities are closer to the 14.8 percent benchmark (see table 1). Compared with spinner 1, you are closer to the 14.8 percent with the majority of the sums, and  you would not experience almost  every third spin possibly getting a sum  of 5 (which to me would be annoying).",9,mtms2011-08-7a,,

"Spinner 3 beat spinner 2 surprisingly often, although the two look similar, suggesting that spinner 2 is often just waiting for the elusive 8 (which is probably why spinner 1 beat both of them). I suppose it raises this question: Is it possible to keep the odds of getting each value 2−8 reasonably high (at least 11.1 percent) while reducing the odds of getting that “annoying” 5?",19,mtms2011-08-7a,,
