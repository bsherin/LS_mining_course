0,El Nino and Snowfall - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"El Niño (Spanish for “The Boy”) is a climate pattern that occurs when water in the Pacific Ocean near the equator gets hotter than usual and affects worldwide atmosphere and weather. El Niño climate conditions occur every few years but are unpredictable. La Niña (Spanish for “The Girl”) is a climate pattern representing the cooling of the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, which impacts worldwide weather and climate conditions.",,
1,El Nino and Snowfall - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"To better understand El Niño and its effects, look at the table (at right), showing snowfall amounts per year for Columbus, Ohio, and the graph (below) of historic El Niño episodes based on recorded sea-surface temperatures in a specific region of the Pacific Ocean.",,

3,El Nino and Snowfall - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"El Niño (red, warmer) and La Niña (blue, cooler) episodes are given categorical values on the basis of ONI (Ocean Niño Index) anomalies. Every change of ±0.5 causes a categorical change.",,
4,El Nino and Snowfall - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
5,El Nino and Snowfall - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"1.  Starting with 1985, find years when a moderate, strong, or very strong El Niño was recorded. For these years, use the Columbus snowfall data to find the mean snowfall in inches.",,
6,El Nino and Snowfall - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,2.  How does taking the moderate El Niño years out of our data and examining only the strong or very strong episodes affect the mean?,,
7,El Nino and Snowfall - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,3. What predictions can you make from the data you have examined? What is a limiting factor in using these data to make predictions about this coming winter? Use this information to predict how many days school will be canceled because of snowfall this year.,,
