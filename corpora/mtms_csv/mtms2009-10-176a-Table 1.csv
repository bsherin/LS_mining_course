Can a Sixth Grader Do Trig?,2,mtms2009-10-176a,,
"Can sixth graders learn trigonometry? Although this material is taught at the high school and college levels, most sixth graders are smart enough to learn it. In fact, South Korean, Romanian, and American schools abroad introduce basic trigonometry in middle school. U.S. schools can do it, too. With the right preparation, any student can learn a bit of trigonometry; a simple curiosity is enough to get started. ",3,mtms2009-10-176a,,
Why is trigonometry important? ,4,mtms2009-10-176a,,
"Trigonometry uses algebra, which would give students good practice employing the algebraic skills of working with exponents and order of operations. Most important, this study benefits students’ thinking processes. Students learn to make connections between a diagram and the original question. This process and method of thinking will be useful in subsequent math classes. ",5,mtms2009-10-176a,,
"I had the opportunity  to present a few trigonometry  lessons in  two sixth-grade classes a few years ago. The teacher was looking for some simple sine, cosine, and tangent problems to provide some exposure to trigonometric ratios for two honors classes. It is not easy to bring new and more advanced subjects to a class, even if it is an honors course. More preparation is required, practice problems should be created, and time needs to be allocated for the lessons. However, the teacher noted, “I don’t normally teach things out of context, but these higher-ability kids take a hit on their scores due to them being so smart. Some exposure to more geometry would let them have a chance of getting more questions correct [on the state exam].”",6,mtms2009-10-176a,,
"Despite my limited experience with  middle school students, I succeeded in making the subject interesting and keeping the class lively. In so doing, I experienced cooperative students. Any teacher can use some of the ideas to present this subject to most classes whenever the situation permits and the benefits are measurable. ",7,mtms2009-10-176a,,
