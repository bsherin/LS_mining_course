3,Books and Products - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"More Lessons Learned from Research: Helping All Students Understand Important Mathematics, Volume 2",,
4,Books and Products - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Edward A. Silver and Patricia Ann Kenney, eds., 2016. Grades pre-K12, 268 pp., $42.95 paper. ISBN 978-0-87353-725-4. Stock no. 14439. National Council of Teachers of Mathematics; http://www.nctm.org",,
5,Books and Products - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Fans and new-comers alike will welcome the most recent iteration of the Lessons Learned from Research series. Like its predecessors, volume 2 compiles thematic research articles from previous issues of the Journal for Research in Mathematics Education (JRME). The strength of the series is that these articles are simplified for easy consumption and edited with practitioners interests in mind.",,
6,Books and Products - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The theme of this volume is teaching for understanding to all students. The editors chose to tackle this broad topic by focusing on two main areas of interest. First, they present articles addressing the important question of teaching to all students. Second, they focus on two separate content strands: arithmetic, algebra, and calculus; and rational numbers and probabilistic reasoning.",,
7,Books and Products - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Each selected JRME article was modified by the original authors, meaning that the readability of the chapters is somewhat inconsistent. The most successful renditions position the research as a backdrop for discussion about practice and include references to more recent research that builds on the source work. Most chapters also relate the work to the Common Core State Standards in Mathematics.",,
8,Books and Products - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The selected articles represent a wide range of grade levels and teaching contexts. Educators will find that chapters focusing on grade levels or subject matter that they do not teach still offer concepts relevant to their practice. Teachers, teacher educators, and researchers who are looking for quick synopses of research following highlighted themes will find this book an engaging read.",,

12,Books and Products - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Putting Essential Understanding of Geometry and Measurement into Practice, 35",,
13,Books and Products - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Kathryn Chval, John Lannin, and Dusty Jones, 2016. Foreword by Linda M. Gojak. 172 pp., $36.95 paper. ISBN 978-0-87353-733-9. Stock no. 14543. National Council of Teachers of Mathematics; http://www.nctm.org",,
14,Books and Products - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"This book delivers on its promise to demonstrate putting essential understandings into practice by tackling the difficult-to-learn-and-to-teach topics of geometry and measurement for grades 35. Each topic is presented in a student-centered perspective and includes common misunderstandings, sample student work, and discussion responses. The text contains activities for remediating misconceptions and covers problem-solving sequences that build on prior knowledge to help students achieve a robust understanding of each topic. The book addresses the topics of angles, area and perimeter, and volume of rectangular prisms. Two-dimensional shapes are also included in the text. Each chapter concludes with a summary of specialized pedagogical content knowledge for presenting, developing, and assessing that topic in the classroom. A More4U online resource contains rich problems that are ready for immediate use in the classroom.",,
15,Books and Products - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The final chapter of the book explores what students should know from Kgrade 2 so that if gaps are noticed, students can be assessed and remediated. This chapter also connects grades 35 understandings with later knowledge to demonstrate the importance of barrier-free learning. In one example given in the book, when a student describes a rectangle as having two long sides and two short sides, the teacher is encouraged not to support this comment but to present an example of a square, which is a rectangle with congruent sides.",,
16,Books and Products - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,This book would be a valuable resource for classroom teachers for not only grades 35 but also grades 6 and 7. It would also be a good resource for university professors who prepare elementary school and middle school teachers.,,

21,Books and Products - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Advanced Common Core Math Explorations: Ratios, Proportions, and Similarity",,
22,Books and Products - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Jerry Burkhart, 2016. 274 pp., $29.95 paper. ISBN 978-1-61821-529-1. Prufrock Press; http://www.prufrock.com",,
23,Books and Products - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Advanced Common Core Math Explorations: Ratios, Proportions and Similarity by Jerry Burkhart is a great resource for teachers of accelerated middle school students. The exploration pages, complete with solutions, depict through classroom vignettes the problems in action. Also provided are questions that can be conversation starters. The problems include real-world connections, such as making a scale for a model of the solar system. These open-ended explorations also require students to deploy important visualizations, making connections between algebra and geometry explicit. The teachers guide introduces the general format of the book; provides best practices for facilitating rich mathematical discussions during class; and makes connections to higher levels of math including algebra, trigonometry, and even precalculus.",,
24,Books and Products - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Although Burkhart provides examples of how the explorations in this book could be implemented with gifted students in a variety of settings (within a heterogeneous class as a small group, in a separate gifted program, or during pullout sessions), the problems in this book would not be useable as a set of independent challenge problems to give students when they finish a class lesson. These rich tasks require some discussion to unpack the mathematics involved and guide students to deepen their conceptual understanding.",,
25,Books and Products - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"However, most of the problems include some suggestions for differentiation, either simplifying the task or extending it deeper still. Because of the adaptability of the problems, this book would be useful for a variety of grade levels, from fifth through eighth. It contains a treasure trove of rich tasks to engage top students.",,

31,Books and Products - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"This book is intended to be a study aid and refresher for midle school students: If youre not loving your textbook and youre not so great at taking notes in class, this notebook will help. The book is physically easy to read with a larger-than-normal font, plenty of color (such as highlighted notes), and a middle-school-friendly writing style.",,
32,Books and Products - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The book could be called a cookbook for middle school math. Percentage problems are presented this way: Find the word is. Put the equal sign above it (p. 117). So is the formula for finding the distance between points on the coordinate grid: Then, plug the values into the formula (p. 413).",,
33,Books and Products - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Although the book is touted as The COMPLETE Middle School Study Guide, it is far from complete. There is no mention of operations with whole numbers, place value, or roundingtopics that middle schoolers often need to review. There is no glossary for finding specific math vocabulary. Some misleading statements are also found, such as, When counting decimal places, dont be fooled by zeros at the endthey dont count (p. 58).",,
34,Books and Products - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Students (and parents) who prefer a hard copy reference to an ebook may want to use this book. Otherwise, they are likely to do just as well using the find function in an online textbook or doing an Internet search to review a topic.",,

40,Books and Products - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"As the title states, the purpose of this book is to inspire and provide any educator (e.g., parent, librarian, classroom teacher, engineer) with step-by-step instructions for implementing Maker projects with adolescents in various contexts, including homes, libraries, museums, after-school clubs, and classrooms.",,
41,Books and Products - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"But what is making? The authors defined making as the process of creating projects based on your ideas and interests (p. 4), typically with tech-inspired, do-it-yourself innovation and cheap, easy-to-use tools (p. vi). The majority of the book is dedicated to eight project sessions that introduce adolescents to circuitry, coding, design, and crafting and engage users in understanding STEAM (science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics) concepts.",,
42,Books and Products - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The step-by-step instructions and detail presented for each project session are strengths of this book. Additional strengths for each project session include learning goals, troubleshooting tips, journal prompts, supplementary online resources, key terms, and illustrations. A potential disadvantage of the projects is the cost of materials (e.g., conductive material, digital camera); therefore, not all projects will be accessible to everyone. In addition, with the exception of one project session (3D forms), there is not an explicit connection to mathematical concepts and skills.",,
43,Books and Products - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I recommend this book for anyone new to making. Before implementing the projects, you should engage in the projects yourself. After implementing the projects, the goal should be to adapt and refine the projects and make them your own. I also challenge mathematics educators to connect the projects to mathematical content and process skills for and with their students.",,
