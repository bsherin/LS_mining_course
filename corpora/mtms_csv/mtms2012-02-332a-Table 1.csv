"Research has shown that students should be given the opportunity to explore mathematical concepts by building on their knowledge and focusing on mathematical reasoning (Goldsmith and Schifter 1997). When students represent ideas, make conjectures, collaborate with others, and give explanations and arguments, they are using mathematical reasoning (NCTM 2000). Wheatley (1991) goes on to say that when students give  they elaborate, clarify, and reorganize their thinking. During discussions with others, students are learning to understand the relationship among ideas that in turn give meaning to mathematical procedures; these ideas then support conceptual understanding (Eisenhart et al. 1993).

These integer operations were primarily addition and subtraction, but multiplication was also introduced. The instruction followed the theory of realistic mathematics education (RME), which states that an activity should focus on an experientially real context (Gravemeijer 1994).

"Students’ ability to give conceptual explanations—to demonstrate their understanding of a subject by discussing it—allows the teacher to evaluate whether students truly understand the concept or whether their understanding is superficial. The expert teacher frequently encouraged students to give conceptual explanations. For instance, once the student became comfortable with the meaning of assets and debts, the teacher asked, “Paris’s net worth  is −$20,000, and Nicole’s net worth is −$22,000. Find the gap between them.” During the discussion, some students had difficulty ordering the negative numbers on a vertical number line. To help students, the teacher encouraged them to give conceptual explanations: ",36,mtms2012-02-332a,,

"During the discussion, Charlie’s first explanation produced a satisfactory answer, and the teacher sought another explanation to ensure that students understood the ordering of the numbers.

The teacher needs to  design tasks with  multiple solutions and encourage students to  compare solution paths and consider  their efficiency.,61,mtms2012-02-332a,,
"However, the teacher’s primary goal was for students to explore the idea of additive inverse, a more efficient solution. When she prompted the class for a quicker way, Brad explained his method and claimed that his method was quicker because he was able to cross out the amounts that were the same but had opposite signs and add fewer numbers. To clarify, the teacher crossed through the inverses as Brad described his solution and asked which solution was quicker. Most agreed that Brad’s solution was quicker and better. ",62,mtms2012-02-332a,,
"Students have a tendency to use  familiar but inefficient solution strategies. Therefore, the teacher needs to design tasks with multiple solutions and encourage students to compare solution paths and consider their efficiency.

"Making conjectures allows students to strengthen their mathematical reasoning. To encourage conjecturing, a teacher can pose questions or assign tasks that offer students opportunities to generalize their ideas. The expert teacher asked students to determine whether verbal descriptions of given transactions were good or bad, such as  “Christian took away an asset of $50 from his net worth statement” and “Donnie takes away a debt of $500.” To make it easier for students to notice the patterns, the teacher introduced some symbols, such as the minus sign for taking away (as an operation) and a negative sign for the debt itself (as a quantity). Stuart noticed a pattern and shared his conjecture: ",64,mtms2012-02-332a,,
"Stuart: I think we should make a class  conjecture about this. If we have the signs both inside and outside the parentheses that are the same, then you are making money—if they are like negative sign and negative sign. You are making money because you are taking away debt, and it is the same if you have both positive signs inside and outside.

"Stuart first made the conjecture that −(−) and +(+) are good, because the person makes money in both cases. With encouragement from the teacher, Stuart added that if the signs are different, as in −(+) and +(−), then it is bad because the person is either taking away an asset or adding a debt. ",69,mtms2012-02-332a,,
"To further the discussion, the  board was divided into two sections: “conjectures” and “theories.” When a student, such as Stuart, made a proposition, it was posted under “conjecture” and listed with the student’s name. Giving students a sense of ownership can motivate them to make and share their conjectures. Once the  proposition was proved, it was moved to the “theory” section. The physical separation of conjectures and theories can be an impetus for students to prove their conjectures.  encoURaging diFFeRent solUtions",70,mtms2012-02-332a,,
"Encouraging students to explore different solutions may help them improve their skills to develop their own solution strategies rather than rely on a single common solution. This exploration emphasizes the importance of devising one’s own solution instead of memorizing someone else’s solution.

In this question, the original and the fi nal net worths were $10,000 and $12,000, respectively, and the transaction was missing. As the discussion continued, students found simple answers, such as +$2000, as well as more complicated transactions, such as –(+$3000) + (+$5000). For each unique answer, the teacher asked the students to analyze the transaction and state whether they agreed or not.
