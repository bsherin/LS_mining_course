"Get “Primed” to the Basic Building Blocks of Numbers divisors are 1 and 2. The number 4 is not a prime, for example, because its factors are 1, 2, and 4. Thus, 4 has more than two distinct divisors and is a composite number.",2,mtms2007-09-122a,,
"Aside from the basic definition of a prime having only two distinct divisors, primes have several other distinguishing characteristics. Examine the list of the ten prime numbers immediately following 2: 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, and 31. From this list, two characteristics are evident. First, all these primes are odd. However, not all odd numbers are prime numbers. For example, 15 is odd, but it has the divisors of 1, 3, 5, and 15, which makes it a composite number. The term odd prime is designated for these prime numbers, but because all prime numbers are odd with the exception of 2, the term is rarely used. Second, the doubledigit prime numbers end in 1, 3, 7, or 9. This characteristic should not be confused with this fallacious reversible statement: All two-digit numbers that end in 1, 3, 7, or 9 are prime numbers. The number 33, for instance, ends in 3 but is not a prime number because it has four factors: 1, 3, 11, and 33.  status of 1",3,mtms2007-09-122a,,
"The ancient Greeks did not consider 1 to be a prime number and thus excluded it from the set. Instead, 1 was considered a special number because it only has one factor—itself. Therefore, by default, 1 does not fit the definition of a prime or a composite number.  the fundaMental  theoReM of aRithMetic",4,mtms2007-09-122a,,
"The fundamental theorem of arithmetic (or unique factorization method) states that every natural number greater than 1 is either a prime number or can be expressed uniquely as a product of prime numbers (NCTM 1989). This process and expression of numbers as a product of primes is known as prime factorization. What makes prime factorizations unique is not the order in which the products occur (because multiplication is commutative) but the way the natural number can be factored—in one unique manner. Consider the different methods in which the number 24 can be factored in figure 1. Although the process of deriving the absolute factorization of 24 can be done in three different ways, the final result is the same. ",5,mtms2007-09-122a,,

"In his book Elements, Euclid established that certain numbers are the building blocks of our natural number system. He revealed that these natural numbers could be “decomposed” into their smallest units as products of specific numbers. Numbers that can only be factored by themselves and 1 are called “prime numbers” and comprise part of the basic building blocks of numbers.",7,mtms2007-09-122a,,

"A prime number is a natural number that has only two distinct factors—1 and the number itself. In other words, the only natural numbers that a prime number can be divided evenly by are 1 and itself. The first prime in our number system is 2, as its two distinct  christiana Robbins, clrobbin@ufl .edu, teaches first grade at Joyce M. Bullock Elementary School in Williston, Florida.

There are many types of prime numbers. Two are considered here: twin prime numbers and palindromic prime numbers. ,11,mtms2007-09-122a,,
"Twin prime numbers The smallest difference between two prime numbers occurs between the first two primes, 2 and 3, with a difference of 1. The next smallest difference between two primes occurs between many other numbers, such as 3 and 5 and 5 and 7. When two prime numbers have a difference of 2, they are called twin primes. Thus, 3 and 5 are twin primes. The numbers 7 and 11 are not twin primes because the difference between them is 4. Twin primes have been investigated by mathematicians to determine whether or not an infinite number of twin prime numbers exists. ",12,mtms2007-09-122a,,
"Palindromic prime numbers Certain numbers that are symmetrical and read the same when their digits are reversed are called palindromes or palindromic numbers. For example, the number 232 is a palindrome because when its digits are reversed, the number is still 232. Accordingly, a palindromic prime number is symmetrical and remains the same when its digits are reversed, such as 11 and 181. Single-digit numbers like 2 and 3 are considered  palindromic numbers, since they only have one digit that remains the same. The first ten palindromic prime numbers in our number system are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 101, 131, 151, 181, and 191.  finding PRiMes: the sieve of eRatosthenes",13,mtms2007-09-122a,,
"Finding prime numbers is less cumbersome because of the mathematical contributions of Eratosthenes (276–194 BC), a Greek mathematician. He developed the sieve of Eratosthenes, a simple algorithm for sifting out all prime numbers up to a specified natural number. His method consists of listing numbers  fig. 1 Prime factorizations for 24 24 24 12",14,mtms2007-09-122a,,

Once all the multiples are crossed out, the next prime number is circled, and all its multiples are crossed out, until all the numbers are either circled or crossed out (Sykes 2006; Yolles 2001). Numbers with circles are primes; those crossed out are composite numbers. This method can be employed to find prime numbers up to any natural number.",18,mtms2007-09-122a,,
goldbach’s conjectuRe,19,mtms2007-09-122a,,
"In 1742, Prussian mathematician Christian Goldbach made a conjecture  28 in a letter to Leonhard Euler, stating that every integer greater than 2 can be expressed as a sum of prime numbers. Since Goldbach considered 1 to be a prime number, his conjecture has been modified several times and currently states that “every even number greater than or equal to six can be represented as the sum of two primes and every odd number greater than or equal to nine as the sum of three odd primes” (NCTM 1989, p. 65). For example, 6 can be expressed as 3 + 3. The number 10 can be expressed as 7 + 3, or as 5 + 5. The number 100 can be expressed as 97 + 3, 89 + 11, 83 + 17, 71 + 29, 59 + 41, or 53 + 47. ",20,mtms2007-09-122a,,
"The current conjecture appears  to be true. For example, the number 9 can be expressed as 3 + 3 + 3. The number 11 can be expressed as 3 +  3 + 5. The number 23 can be expressed as 19 + 2 + 2, 17 + 3 + 3, 13 + 7 + 3, 13 + 5 + 5, or 11 + 7 + 5. This conjecture has been tested but has yet to be proved or disproved.",21,mtms2007-09-122a,,

"The study of numbers, their properties, and relationships allows us to explore the logic of numbers. It also gives us an opportunity to examine the importance of prime numbers. The simple concept of a number being divisible by two distinct numbers, 1 and itself, provides great opportunities for studying number theory.  teacheRs’ notes",23,mtms2007-09-122a,,
"The study of prime numbers can be an interesting endeavor for students. Challenge students to use resources (e.g., the Internet) to find a definition of prime numbers and related definitions and examples. Challenge students to justify their position on whether a number is prime or not. Perhaps most confusing to students is that 2 is an even number and is also classified as being a prime. Having students discuss this matter can support the work they will do with the activities.  activity sheet solutions 1. See table 1.",24,mtms2007-09-122a,,
