Building an Online Discussion,1,mtms2007-05-530a,,
Group for Teachers,2,mtms2007-05-530a,,
"C ONvErSATIONS  wITH  COLLEAGuES  CAN  bE  valuable  in  thinking  through  the  logistics  of implementing the NCTM’s (2000) recommendations for teaching mathematics. The following  exchange  took  place  among  a  group  of  three educators after reading an article related to helping middle school students attain an understanding of the  NCTM  Process  Standards  of  Problem  Solving and reasoning and Proof (Nosegbe-Okoka 2004):  as  math,  we  can  help  them  make  connections.  In science, the students could justify the design of an experiment or a position on an environmental issue. The same sort of arrangement could be established in social studies and health. Teachers would have to agree on the strategy, and the common understanding of “justify” would need to be established.",3,mtms2007-05-530a,,
"Kaley: The point that struck me as I read was “The teacher should help students distinguish between answers that are well justified and answers that are simply explanations of what was done.” wow. I agree, but I am wondering how many of us are thrilled just to get a correct explanation of what was done, that we do not push for an actual justification. Honestly, I think I would need help teaching students the difference. ",4,mtms2007-05-530a,,
"Helen: Kaley, I had the same thoughts as I was reading the article. whenever I do a problem-solving activity with my students, I am pleased that they can come up with an answer and explain to me how they  arrived  at  the  answer.  Asking  them  to  justify their answer never occurred to me.",5,mtms2007-05-530a,,
"Elaine:  I  think  that  we  must  use  the  term  “justify” in other contexts and classes. . . . On the reading test, students must “support their answers with detail from the story.” while not the same exactly  rANDALL GrOTH, regroth@salisbury.edu, teaches mathematics  education  courses  for  preservice and  in-service  teachers  at  Salisbury  University in Salisbury, MD 21801.

"An unusual aspect of this exchange was that the individuals were all in different locations when it took place.  In  addition,  there  was  a  seven-hour  gap  between the posting of the first comment and the last comment  because  each  individual  contributed  to the discussion at her convenience. Geographic and scheduling barriers were broken down because the conversation took place online.",7,mtms2007-05-530a,,
"Online  discussion  boards,  such  as  the  one  on which the conversation above took place, can help mathematics teachers form communities and participate in the active exchange of ideas (Newell, wilsman,  Langenfeld,  and  McIntosh  2002).  Teachers can communicate with one another even if they are separated by time or distance, and they can also take time to reflect on and respond to multiple strands of thought within any given conversation. This article describes our experiences building and sustaining an online discussion community of nine educators dispersed among various buildings in a school district. The first author served as the discussion moderator; the  second  author  helped  evaluate  and  design  the discussions. As we describe our experiences, we will offer advice for others interested in establishing and facilitating similar discussions among teachers. ",8,mtms2007-05-530a,,
A Model for Thinking about Online Interactions,9,mtms2007-05-530a,,
"SALMON (2004) PrOvIDED A uSEfuL MODEL fOr thinking about the types of interactions that can occur on a discussion board. She described different  stages in the formation of an online community. The stages  are  distinguished  from  one  another  by  the nature  of  the  interaction  among  individuals  in  the community. Although discussion board moderators cannot and should not attempt to force participants through the stages, they can be conscious of seizing opportunities to help them progress from one stage to the next. Salmon’s model was useful in helping the moderator recognize such opportunities. It was also  helpful  for  understanding  and  describing  the types of participation that took place among discussion group members. ",10,mtms2007-05-530a,,
"Salmon  (2004)  outlined  five  stages  in  the  formation  of  an  online  community.  In  the  first  stage, participants join the discussion by successfully accessing  the  needed  technology.  The  second  stage occurs when participants learn to send and receive messages in the online environment and find people with whom to interact. During the third stage, information begins to be exchanged in the discussion forum. The exchange of information continues at the fourth stage, but it becomes more collaborative, and participants begin to build new shared understandings  through  extended  conversations.  At the fifth stage, participants begin to reflect on the shared  understandings  they  have  built.  They  also  vOL. 12, NO. 9  .  MAy 2007   531 identify and pursue individual learning goals based on the knowledge constructed in collaboration with others. An online community does not necessarily go through the stages in a linear fashion, as it may revisit various stages over its lifespan. ",11,mtms2007-05-530a,,
Going through the Stages,12,mtms2007-05-530a,,
"STAGES  1  AND  2  IN  SALMON’S  (2004)  MODEL  IN- volve  helping  participants  gain  access  to  the  technology used for the online discussion and exchange messages with one another. we found an initial faceto-face meeting effective for attaining these two goals. Participants were asked to read an article on teaching mathematics (van de walle 1999, available at www .mathematicallysane.com/analysis/reformvsbasics .asp), post their reactions to it on the discussion board, and reply to reactions that had been posted by others. As problems with performing these tasks arose during the meeting, they were remedied through interaction with the course moderator and others who were familiar with the technology. for example, when some participants could not figure out how to post replies to messages on the discussion board, the moderator and other participants helped them through the process. by the end of the meeting, everyone understood the mechanics of posting reactions and replying to others. This allowed teachers to engage in interactions typical of stages 3, 4, and 5 in the subsequent weeks.",13,mtms2007-05-530a,,
"Stage  3  involves  the  exchange  of  information relevant to the purpose of the community. Early on, the course moderator was among the first to use the discussion  board  to  share  instructional  strategies. for  example,  when  a  question  about  how  to  help students with decimal computations was posted, the moderator wrote the following:",14,mtms2007-05-530a,,
"One of my favorite problems for helping students think about where a decimal should be placed after an operation goes something like this. Instructions: without actually doing the calculations, decide  where  the  decimal  should  go  on  the  right side of each of the following four equations:  1. 3.23 × .56 = 18088 2. 4.56 + 23.782 = 28432 3. 15.2 divided by 3.4 = 4470588235 4. 99.2 – 86.437 = 12763",15,mtms2007-05-530a,,
"I like this sort of problem because it gets students to think about the sizes of numbers involved in the problem instead of having them get caught up in trying to memorize a procedure about placing the decimal (e.g., 4.56 + 23.782 is somewhere in the upper 20s, so it only makes sense to put the decimal after the “8” on the right hand side of the equation).",16,mtms2007-05-530a,,
"Participants in the online discussion also began to offer information early on, providing links to their favorite  instructional  web  sites  and  references  to useful books. At the end of each week of discussion, the moderator took stock of the needs that had been expressed by teachers, then suggested a new article from Mathematics Teaching in the Middle School or Teaching Children Mathematics that provided information to address those needs. The new article provided the starting point for a fresh discussion board exchange each week. ",17,mtms2007-05-530a,,
"Once participants become comfortable exchanging information with one another online, the stage is set for more in-depth interactions, part of Salmon’s stage 4 model. Sometimes this interaction involves fleshing out developing ideas during online debates. A good example of this type of interaction occurred during a discussion of an article arguing that teaching students a “key word” approach to solving word problems is harmful (Clement and bernhard 2005). Here is an excerpt from the debate:",18,mtms2007-05-530a,,
"Moderator: There seems to be some support in various  discussion  threads  for  retaining  the  “key word” approach alongside a “quantitative analysis” approach. Could doing this be like trying to mix oil and water? If students have been “trained” to look for key words, wouldn’t it short-circuit their disposition to want to look for quantitative relationships in a problem?",19,mtms2007-05-530a,,
"Jaclyn: The danger that I see in teaching students the  primacy  of  using  key  words  in  trying  to  solve word problems is that they may not engage with all elements  of  the  problem,  only  the  words  and  the numbers they point to. what about the relationships of unmentioned numbers, numbers that in a problem may have to be represented by a nonnumeric symbol? If, however, we can teach key words as a part of the tool box, which includes alternatives such as manipulatives, working it backward, acting it out, using graphic organizers, as well as using quantitative analysis, why wouldn’t it work?",20,mtms2007-05-530a,,
"Kaley:  I  am  starting  to  equate  using  key  words to mathematical mad libs. If all they [the students] need to do is replace the “key words” with the appropriate  sign  for  the  correlating  function,  they haven’t thought about the real-world application at all, and they might be using the wrong function. I do realize how time-consuming the approach that is suggested in the article will be, and I am not altogether convinced that it will make sense to a lot of students. but I still agree that using key words often leads students astray.",21,mtms2007-05-530a,,
"Joan: That is very profound, Kaley. However, one must  draw  into  their  mathematical  bag  of  tricks  to reach the multitude of students that crosses through  the classroom door over the years. Let’s not write off the use of key words as “missing the meaning of life.” There is a place for this. Once the analysis of a word has been completed and mastered, many a student can cruise through a problem using the word as an instant connection to the math concept represented. ",22,mtms2007-05-530a,,
"These excerpts reflect the diversity of opinions present regarding the use of key-word teaching strategies.  Although  teachers  did  not  completely  agree with the moderator or the article recommendations, there was still value in having the debate. It indicated that participants had reached a level of comfort in  working  together  that  would  form  the  basis  for future collaborative learning. ",23,mtms2007-05-530a,,
"Participants showed evidence of reaching stage 5 by reflecting on their learning and identifying areas for future improvement. Teachers frequently identified directions to further their professional development. One week, many strongly advocated meeting to plan mathematics lessons collaboratively. Another week, teachers decided to put together a mathematics newsletter to send out to parents, having been inspired  to  do  so  by  an  article  that  had  served  as the basis for the week’s discussion (brahier 2001). On yet another occasion, some teachers said they needed more knowledge of the alternative computational algorithms that students brought with them from  elementary  school.  They  wanted  to  visit  the elementary  schools  where  their  students  learned these algorithms to better understand them. Given these requests, it was valuable to have the curriculum  coordinator  for  the  district  as  a  participant  in the discussions, since she was able to arrange visits to the elementary schools and also advocate to other administrators for the time needed for activities such as collaborative lesson planning.  by  the  end  of  the  school  year  in  which  the  discussions  took  place,  all  teachers  had  shown  some evidence of visiting stage 5 in Salmon’s (2004) model, since all had identified avenues for learning beyond the discussion board. Participants also at times revisited earlier stages, engaging in information sharing, debate, and collaboration even after reaching stage 5. ",24,mtms2007-05-530a,,
Reflecting on the Discussion Board  Experience and Lessons Learned,25,mtms2007-05-530a,,
"OvEr  THE  COurSE  Of  Our  INvOLvEMENT  wITH the  online  discussions,  we  learned  some  valuable lessons that may be of interest to teachers or administrators  wishing  to  establish  and  facilitate  online discussion  communities  for  mathematics  teachers in  their  own  school  districts.  To  conclude,  we  will highlight what we considered to be the six most important lessons learned.",26,mtms2007-05-530a,,
Lesson 1: Plan for occasional face-to-face meetings,27,mtms2007-05-530a,,
"A discussion board is a unique environment in that it allows teachers separated by time or distance to discuss  common  interests  and  identify  goals  for professional development. In our discussion board community,  this  sort  of  communication  created opportunities  for  future  collaborative  work,  such as  constructing  common  lesson  plans  and  parent newsletters  to  communicate  teaching  practices  to parents. Many teachers in our group, however, preferred to do these tasks face to face rather than online. Therefore, to attain the highest possible levels of collaboration, we advise potential online discussion moderators to find times for face-to-face meetings  to  follow  up  on  issues  raised  online.  without such follow-up meetings, it is possible that many innovative ideas raised during online discussion will not progress past the talking stage. ",28,mtms2007-05-530a,,
Lesson 2: Foster disagreements,29,mtms2007-05-530a,,
A discussion board allows teachers separated by time or distance to  discuss common interests,30,mtms2007-05-530a,,
"At first glance, it might seem that the advice to foster disagreements is actually counterproductive to sustaining an online community. However, some of the most instructive exchanges often occur when there is a difference of opinion among discussion board participants.  we  encountered  numerous  disagreements  in  our  discussions of  the  article  outlining  the rationale for discarding the key-word approach to solving  word  problems  (Clement  and  bernhard  2005). Several disagreements also  occurred  during  our discussion  of  an  article arguing  that  the  teaching of  basic  skills  should  be reduced  in  middle  school mathematics  classes  (Devlin 1999). At their best, discussion threads containing disagreements can prompt participants  to  reflect  on and refine their reasoning. At their worst, threads containing  disagreements  can  degenerate  into  the posting  of  circular  arguments  based  on  personal teaching  preferences.  To  help  transform  disagreements  into  learning  sites  for  teachers,  the  online discussion  moderator  can  encourage  participants to support their positions with reference to relevant classroom experiences or research. If arguing from data becomes a norm for the discussion board community, disagreements can become powerful learning experiences.  vOL. 12, NO. 9  .  MAy 2007   533",31,mtms2007-05-530a,,
Lesson 3: Choose readings based on issues that  participants raise,32,mtms2007-05-530a,,
"In  establishing  a  discussion  board  community,  a moderator might be tempted to preselect the articles and the sequence in which they will be discussed. Although  we  did  select  some  articles  in  advance and  outlined  a  tentative  discussion  sequence,  we quickly discovered that it was necessary to rethink the original plan as the conversations unfolded. for example, the article describing pitfalls of key-word approaches  (Clement  and  bernhard  2005)  was  in the original sequence, but it was discussed earlier than planned when the teaching approach came up in  an  early  conversation.  As  another  example,  we asked teachers to read an additional article describing basic skills in mathematics (brahier 2001) when the first article (Devlin 1999) sparked a great deal of controversy and interest. Therefore, although it is  important  for  moderators  to  have  a  plan  for  articles to be read, it is also important that the plan be flexible enough to be responsive to issues raised by discussion participants.",33,mtms2007-05-530a,,
Lesson 4: Emphasize the power and importance of reflection,34,mtms2007-05-530a,,
It is important  for a plan to be  flexible enough  to be responsive to issues raised by discussion participants,35,mtms2007-05-530a,,
"Online discussion boards offer unique opportunities for  reflecting  on  the  thoughts  of  others  and  carefully  crafting  responses.  face-to-face  conversations tend to be more fast paced and not as conducive to this  type  of  interaction.  To take  full  advantage  of  this discussion  board  feature, participants  must  understand  the  importance  of actively  posting  responses. Occasionally,  we  encountered  time  periods  when some  were  hesitant to post  their  thoughts  to  the board.  In  such  instances, the  moderator  emphasized that  their  posts  were  the lifeblood  of  the  discussion community.  Posts  serve  as valuable  objects  for  others to reflect on. They also help the  individual  who  is  posting  the  message  to  reflect on instructional beliefs and practices. without a steady stream of postings, learning in a discussion board can come to a grinding halt. we established a norm in our discussion community that  each  individual  would  post  at  least  four  times per week and that at least three of every four postings should be replies to others. This helped us take advantage of the reflective opportunities afforded by the online discussion board. ",36,mtms2007-05-530a,,
Lesson 5: Choose a platform that suits your needs,37,mtms2007-05-530a,,
"To  progress  beyond  stage  1  in  Salmon’s  model  of online  learning,  all  discussion  board  participants need to be comfortable accessing the system. for our discussions, we used the online system called Desire2Learn, because some teachers in the district had previously used it and could help others who encountered difficulties. Other platforms are available for  purchase,  such  as  blackboard,  which  has  the capability  to  host  discussion  boards.  Increasingly, discussion boards can be set up free of charge. free providers  such  as  groups.google.com  and  groups.",38,mtms2007-05-530a,,
"yahoo.com  are  likely  to  be  sufficient  to  meet  the needs of those who simply wish to establish discussion board conversations among colleagues. Those establishing new discussion communities may wish to try the free providers first. If participants find that they outgrow the system’s capabilities, they might decide to secure funds to purchase a more sophisticated platform. ",39,mtms2007-05-530a,,
Lesson 6: Involve administrators,40,mtms2007-05-530a,,
"As online discussion communities reach stage 5 in Salmon’s  model,  participants  begin  to  identify  directions  for  extending  their  own  learning.  In  our situation,  teachers  identified  collaborative  lesson planning; formulated a plan for communicating with parents;  and  learned  more  about  lessons,  including alternative algorithms as personal professional development  needs.  before  the  online  discussions began,  there  was  no  plan  for  building  these  kinds of activities into the professional development structure of the school district. As teachers raised these concerns, the curriculum coordinator participating in the conversations noted them and took steps to build  them  into  the  district’s  professional  development plans. In this way, the online discussion helped teachers  identify  professional  development  needs and  effectively  communicate  their  importance  to the administration. ",41,mtms2007-05-530a,,
Conclusion,42,mtms2007-05-530a,,
"IN THIS ArTICLE, wE HAvE OuTLINED JuST A fEw of the benefits and challenges associated with establishing  and  sustaining  an  online  discussion  board community focused on the discussion of mathematics pedagogy. we encourage readers to explore this issue further by gathering a few colleagues together to  start  online  conversations.  These  conversations  offer colleagues the chance to reflect on  practice,  learn  from  the  experiences of others, overcome some of the isolation  frequently  associated  with the  teaching  profession,  and  identify areas for personal growth. ultimately, our  students  reap  the  benefits  as  we become more adept in teaching mathematics through such experiences.",43,mtms2007-05-530a,,
