"D urING  A  rECENT  vISIT  TO  A  SEvENTH-  grade classroom, the following warm-up question was used: ",5,mtms2007-05-518a,,
Problem: One day the temperature went from a high of 86 degrees at noon to a low of 62 degrees at midnight. How much did it change?,6,mtms2007-05-518a,,
"It is likely that the teacher chose the question to give students practice solving word problems and that the vast  majority  of  students  calculated  86°  –  62°  =  24° without thinking of absolute value. Most of them probably did not think in this way: “A change in temperature is Tfinal − Tinitial, but the language of the problem states that it is the amount of decrease that is asked for. So I want to calculate the absolute value of that answer; therefore, |62° – 86°| = |–24°| = 24°.” The incongruity between the two types of responses reveals that students might not see the subtle difference between “change in . . . ,” which could be positive or negative, and “amount of change in . . . ,” which is always positive. This subtle difference is a topic for discussion. ",7,mtms2007-05-518a,,

Introduction to Absolute Value,9,mtms2007-05-518a,,
"WHEN  STuDENTS  ArE  INTrODuCED  TO  PLOTting  points  on  a  two-dimensional  coordinate  grid, they are expected to understand that the length of a  horizontal  (or  vertical)  line  segment  equals  the difference  of  the  x-coordinates  (or  y-coordinates). It is an accepted convention that length cannot be a negative amount, so there is a natural association between calculating length and whole-number subtraction from the beginning. ",10,mtms2007-05-518a,,
"If students are allowed to count the spaces when they first encounter distance on number lines, they see no difference between these questions: “Find the distance between 6 and 2 on the number line” and “Find the distance between 2 and 6 on the number line.” These questions could introduce absolute value on a conceptual level. unfortunately, only one of those questions can be asked before negative numbers are introduced. Problems in which the quantities increase reinforce students’ misunderstanding of a problem context as simple computation when it  actually  involves  absolute  value.  In  that  context, there is no difference between the change in temperature (Tfinal − Tinitial) and the difference between the whole-number subtraction problem created by the measurements (the absolute value of a positive quantity is the number itself).",11,mtms2007-05-518a,,
"One reason to formally introduce absolute value is to be able to make integer addition and subtraction operations explicit. Many textbooks give scant attention to the geometric interpretation of absolute value as the distance from 0 on a number line. In our textbook, the chain of events is described in this way: (1) show a number line indicating the distance from 0 is the same for two numbers; (2) ask several standard questions evaluating the absolute value for specified numbers; and (3) solve routine equations of the form |x| = k, for some integer k. A student might learn to mimic the representation of |k| on a number line, take the absolute value of numbers by either dropping all consideration  for  sign  or  switching  the  sign  when working  with  a  negative  number,  and  solve  simple absolute value equations by going directly from the problem statement |x| = k to its solution x = ±k.",12,mtms2007-05-518a,,
Conceptual Knowledge for Absolute Value,13,mtms2007-05-518a,,
"That treatment may be sufficient to allow students to answer questions on standardized tests, but it is incomplete  for  developing  conceptual  understanding of the topic. For example, do the students understand  that  |x  –  0|  really  means  “the  distance  that  x is from 0”? Without actually doing the calculations, would students recognize that |4 – 6| and |6 – 4| both represent a distance of 2 units away from 0? (See the diagram in fig. 1.) Would they be able to recognize that |8 – 3| = |10 – 5|? Would students be able to articulate the meaning of absolute value when looking at a representation of an integer quantity?

Fig. 2  A procedural understanding of absolute value may lead to confusion about this situation.,16,mtms2007-05-518a,,
"negative integers, they know that the absolute value of 5 blue chips (when blue represents a positive value) is 5. However, the absolute value of 5 red chips (when red represents a negative value) is also 5. ",17,mtms2007-05-518a,,
"If students have only a procedural understanding of this topic, they will have difficulty solving absolute value equations (and inequalities), reducing |x| to either x or –x for a particular value, and in graphing absolute value functions. They may have difficulty distinguishing  between  an  amount  and  an  amount with an implied direction: If they want to start at 2 and go to the left 6, they will end up at a different point on the number line (–4) than if they start at 6 and go to the left 2 (4). However, both are 4 units away from 0. (See the diagram in fig. 2.) ",18,mtms2007-05-518a,,
Teaching Ideas,19,mtms2007-05-518a,,
"WE Can buILD A SOLID FOuNDATION FOr MIDDLE school students’ understanding of absolute value on a conceptual level. Some ideas follow.  1.  When  the  concept  of  “distance  between  two points” is introduced, use both counting and subtraction strategies. Counting reinforces the fact that subtraction calculates the interval distance. Also, ask students to construct a problem that would determine the distance between two points, and shuffle the order in which the two points are given. Ask students, “Will it matter if I start at 2 and go to 6 on the number line, or start at 6 and go to 2?” to reinforce the fact that the distance is independent of the direction taken.",20,mtms2007-05-518a,,
"2.  before  introducing  the  standard  definition  of absolute value, ask students to find the distance between  two  points  on  a  number  line.  Mix  up  specifying the smaller and larger value as the first point given.  Ask  students  how  they  might  compute  that distance, just knowing the two values. Introduce the  notation |a – b| to mean “the distance between a and b”  or  |b  –  a|  to  mean  “the  distance  between  b  and a” and ask students to write expressions for various problems as well as find the distance. Students will understand that |a – b| = |b – a| and realize that these expressions represent the distance between the two, no matter the order of the values.",21,mtms2007-05-518a,,
" 3. After introducing the standard definition of absolute value as the magnitude (size) of a number, ask students to compare the expressions |a|, |–a|, |a – 0|, and |0 – a| for a variety of values for a, both positive and negative. Emphasize that switching the sign of the variable does not affect the absolute value (because opposite numbers are the same distance from 0). Further clarify that since subtracting zero never changes a quantity and that subtraction is not commutative, the last two expressions represent a distance that can be found by indicating the endpoints in either order and are equivalent. Challenge students to explain their thinking in terms of these expressions, and ask them to consider which expression would be most convenient to use in which situations.",22,mtms2007-05-518a,,
" 4. When giving students simple absolute value equations,  remind  them  about  the  distance  interpretation.  Symbolic  manipulation  is  frequently emphasized, followed by graphing the solution set on  a  number  line.  Consider  reversing  that  order, having  students  interpret  equations  of  the  form  |x – h| = k as “find a point x whose distance from h is k units,” and use the number line to find the solution. Then use symbolic notation to verify that solution. Next, extend the students’ understanding by considering absolute value inequalities in a similar fashion (with solutions on the set of integers) and equations of the form |x – a| = |x – b|.",23,mtms2007-05-518a,,
Conclusion ,24,mtms2007-05-518a,,
"ACCOrDING  TO  THE  NCTM’S  Principles and Standards for School Mathematics,  “In  high  school,  students’ understanding  of  number is  the foundation for their understanding of algebra, and their fluency with number operations is the basis for learning to operate fluently with symbols” (NCTM 2000, p. 291). The manner in which  absolute  value  is  introduced to  students  in  middle  school  has far-reaching  consequences  for  their future  mathematical  understanding. It  begins  to  lay  the  foundation  for students’  understanding  of  algebra, which can change middle school students’ appreciation for mathematics. Of course, this conclusion can be applied  to  other  concepts  introduced in  the  middle  school,  as  well,  such  as only giving data sets that require that larger numbers be used on the y-axis  and  only  dividing  by  smaller numbers  so  that  the  answer  is  always smaller than the initial number. However,  that  discussion  is  for  another day. ",25,mtms2007-05-518a,,
