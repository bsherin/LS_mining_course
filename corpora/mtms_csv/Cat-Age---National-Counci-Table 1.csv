0,Cat Age - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Animals age at different rates than humans. A 1-year-old cat is not at the same level of maturity as a 1-year-old human. If a cat owner wishes to know the age of his or her pet, a veterinarian can supply that information by looking at charts. For example, a vet has collected information in table 1 for cats from 3 to 17 years old. Information for a junior cat (age 7 months to 2 years) is given in table 2. Help the veterinarian find a formula or rule so that he or she can accurately determine the equivalent age of a cat in human years.",,
