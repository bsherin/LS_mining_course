Story problems—once feared— became the most powerful tool in this teacher’s classroom.,2,mtms2008-12-300a,,
"wWhile sharing coffee with my  husband one Saturday morning, I found myself defending my teaching philosophy and methods. While he grumbled about the breakdown in educating our youth, I complained about the negative attitudes of teachers toward the standards-based mathematics program at the middle school where I teach. His comment that “students need to know their basic skills” referred to their lack of proficiency in addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. He felt that these areas ",3,mtms2008-12-300a,,

"are often overlooked with a standardsbased approach. “Yes, I agree,” I fired back, “but students have to apply those skills to solve problems in the real world.”",6,mtms2008-12-300a,,
"A standards-based approach in  mathematics involves using story problems to allow students to investigate a solution. This approach emphasizes an understanding of concepts and processes and assumes mastery of basic computation skills. One of NCTM’s goals is to improve mathematics education by changing the way both students and teachers think about mathematics (NCTM 2000). This discussion made me realize that to persuade others, I would need to show how I came to support this philosophy. My passage from nonbeliever to believer in teaching a standards-based approach came neither quickly nor easily. ",7,mtms2008-12-300a,,
My JournEy,8,mtms2008-12-300a,,
"As an elementary school student, I remember struggling with mathematics. I did not understand my mistakes and simply assumed that I was not smart. My teacher taught mathematics by working a few examples on the board and then assigning sixty more for seatwork. After some time to complete the assignment, we traded papers, and the teacher read the answers. When my paper was returned, I knew it would be covered with those big red Xs. During the lesson, there was no talking, no questions, and no thinking. The story problems were especially painful because I had no idea how to solve them, and my only feedback was those shameful Xs. My confidence in having any mathematics ability began to droop as much as my face. I was learning that answers were either right or wrong, and too often mine were wrong. ",9,mtms2008-12-300a,,
"Years later, I carried my discomfort with mathematics into my career as a fifth-grade teacher. I believed that the way I was taught was good ",10,mtms2008-12-300a,,
"With a standardsbased mathematics lesson, more than one teacher is in the classroom enough for me and therefore it would be good enough for my students. Since teaching story problems was especially challenging, I skipped them. The word problems at the end of the chapter were ignored, because I had no tolerance for the inevitable grumbling I would be hearing from students. The prepared tests from the book were used and, once again, students were told to ignore the word problems. I knew that students skipped those problems if I were to assign them and, in addition, they were time-consuming to grade. Little did I realize that I was not using the best part of the lesson and was denying my students an opportunity to learn and express their ability to solve problems. Story problems teach students to think.",11,mtms2008-12-300a,,
"I later became a Title 1 mathematics teacher and was expected to teach second through sixth graders. It became clear that I did not know how to solve story problems, let alone teach others to be successful with them. The county offered excellent staff development for Title 1 teachers that launched me into the NCTM’s Standards. The instruction I received and strategies I learned to teach story problems resulted in my ability to see mathematics in a different light. NCTM’s Standards encouraged students to investigate complex story problems with topics such as computer games, baseball, or MP3 players. The following example is an investigation into ratio and proportion: ",12,mtms2008-12-300a,,
"A baseball team won 48 of its first 80 games. How many of its next 50 games must the team win in order to maintain the ratio of wins to losses? (NCTM 2000, p. 256) ",13,mtms2008-12-300a,,
"I learned that students are expected to talk about solving problems. The key to the success of a standards-based mathematics program is choosing problems not only for their content but also for the potential variety of solution methods. I have witnessed students’ excitement while they explained their reasoning of an answer and have heard other students respond with different solutions. With a standardsbased mathematics lesson, more than one teacher is in the classroom. ",14,mtms2008-12-300a,,
"During a West Virginia Council of Teachers of Mathematics Conference, I attended a workshop titled “Standards Based Instruction with an Emphasis on Project Merit.” Project Merit is a “collaborative effort among the West Virginia Department of Education, the University and State College Systems of West Virginia, the West Virginia Council of Teachers of Mathematics, and the West Virginia Mathematics and Science Coalition to ensure that all middle school students would improve their mathematics performance training” (Porter, Campbell, and Munza 2001). ",15,mtms2008-12-300a,,
"The presenter began by explaining standards-based mathematics and that the NCTM’s Content Standards (Number and Operations, Algebra, Geometry, Measurement, Data Analysis and Probability) and Process Standards (Problem Solving, Reasoning and Proof, Communication, Connections, and Representation) formed the foundation. She then walked us through an example of a standards-based approach. ",16,mtms2008-12-300a,,
"She held up a brown paper bag and said that three green cubes and two blue cubes were inside the bag. We were not allowed to look but had to guess what cube would be pulled  out. After going through the exercise several times, we discussed what it meant: how to determine probability. This method of investigating a problem to formulate a solution helped me understand how different it was from my current teaching method of giving students “the” way to work through a problem and then expecting them to do it. Allowing students to discover a solution was a rich learning experience; talking about solutions with other students made it an even richer experience. I left the workshop with a new understanding of standards-based mathematics and the door prize, a T-shirt containing the mathematical expression “2 Teach Is 2 Awesome 4 Words.” ",17,mtms2008-12-300a,,
"Once back in the classroom, I  used the same probability example with my students and later presented a workshop overview to teachers at a staff development meeting. I can still remember my enthusiasm and that I wanted my colleagues to feel that same excitement. I also incorporated these ideas of problem-based instruction when asked to conduct a parent workshop.",18,mtms2008-12-300a,,

"I noticed that my students were talking more about mathematics during the lessons, which was good. When a student did not understand a problem, I asked another student to explain his or her answer. The focus shifted from whether an answer was right or wrong to the solution process and the understanding of the problem. I encouraged my students by saying, “We love mistakes; that’s how we learn.” Errors, rather than being the gateway to wrong answers, lead us to new understanding.  thE LEarning JournEy ContinuEd",21,mtms2008-12-300a,,
"Several years later, I was one of forty teachers to sign up for Project Merit, which required two years of face to face classes using MathScape, a  standards-based curriculum (EDC 1998). The group shared both teaching successes and failures in a professional learning community. Veteran teachers brought in examples of their students’ work and talked about lessons they had taught. Rubrics and answers represented excellent, good,  and poor student work. Teachers discussed how they had presented material and how students had responded. One teacher brought in giant posters, which she had placed around her classroom. The posters were decorated with graphs that students had cut out of magazines or created themselves. She described her students’ excitement as they made poster presentations and the discussion that the displays generated. I was captivated and could imagine her students’ enthusiasm. Another teacher who had planned to retire was so energized by this way of teaching that she decided to continue teaching. These teachers who used a standards-based approach were animated and passionate, and their enthusiasm was contagious. I began to see my students’ positive responses and increased confidence in mathematics and began hearing these comments, “I love math,” “Math is my best subject,” and “Can I be a teacher?” I was assigning story problems, and my students were talking about answers. I remember one student eagerly trying to explain her thinking to another student. As they talked, a miracle happened: The student began to understand. ",22,mtms2008-12-300a,,
"Three years ago, the county  adopted a standards-based learning curriculum, Connected Mathematics 2 (Lappan et al. 2006), and offered four days of staff development training. The county enlisted help from Project Merit teachers. Periodic discussion groups and additional training were also available as teachers began to use this curriculum. I was ready and prepared to teach this new curriculum.",23,mtms2008-12-300a,,

"My journey was a process of growth and understanding, which prepared me to teach standards-based mathematics. To teach this method  without training and support would have been extremely difficult. How can untrained teachers be effective with a standards-based mathematics program? After the county adopted Connected Mathematics 2, I began to hear teachers comment, “I hate this new adoption” and “We need to teach the basics.” These comments reflect a lack of sufficient training in a standards-based program. “Systemic mathematics reform—so that every teacher in every classroom engages students in standards-based instruction and all students achieve at high levels—requires a lengthy and complex process” (Briars 1999, p. 32). “Teachers need substantial, continuing professional development and in-class support . . . much more and different kinds of professional development to implement standards-based programs” (Briars 1999, p. 3).",25,mtms2008-12-300a,,

"I have come a long way since winning that mathematics T-shirt at the workshop. My students have won much more. If teachers are going to survive standards-based mathematics, they require training. Administrators need to offer this training in the form of comprehensive staff development so that teachers feel comfortable with standards-based goals. Before our county adopted standards-based instruction, sixth-grade standardized mathematics test scores were 66 percent for students at or above mastery. By 2007, test scores had increased to 74 percent (West Virginia Department of Education Office of Student Assessment Services 2007). ",27,mtms2008-12-300a,,
Launch your remarkable journey. The outcome will be awesome. Your students will love learning mathematics. Take a deep breath and step into a standards-based classroom.,28,mtms2008-12-300a,,
