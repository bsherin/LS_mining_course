"Many eighth-grade and algebra 1 textbooks explore the formula  distance = rate × time. Problems involving this formula can help students learn to write expressions, solve equations, and make judgments as to the reasonableness of the answers found.",3,mtms2010-09-116a(1),,
"While teaching the d = rt formula over the years, I have found student interest to be lacking. I have also found that the textbook’s approach to this formula involved procedural knowledge rather than conceptual understanding. ",4,mtms2010-09-116a(1),,
A typical textbook lesson begins by  asking students to create a chart and fill in the blanks. Students often do not understand where the expressions or equations come from and may be ,5,mtms2010-09-116a(1),,

"The first step in any instruction is  getting the students’ attention. The following method, which does just that, can be adapted to other problems, as well, to show students the logic behind setting up expressions, solving equations, and working with the solutions.",7,mtms2010-09-116a(1),,
" This activity uses tables of num- bers, symbols, and a dynamic representation of the problem on the graphing calculator. A table of values, algebra, and a visual display of trains help students gain an understanding of the algebra involved and its purpose. Generating the values on the table leads directly to the algebraic  table 1 Students can construct a table to compare the two train trips.  hour train 1 train 2 fig. 1 Using the window settings in (a), students get a good sense of the relationship between the two trains from the graph in (b).",8,mtms2010-09-116a(1),,

"To begin, activity sheet 1 presents  the following scenario:   Liza Dash lives in Philadelphia and has to get to Atlanta as fast as possible. Since Liza has a fear of flying, she plans to travel by train. One train leaves at 12:00 and travels an average of 70 mph. A second train leaves 2 hours later but averages 85 mph. Assuming that the distance between the two cities is about 750 miles, which train should she take to arrive in Atlanta as early as possible?",11,mtms2010-09-116a(1),,
"If your students have only a basic understanding of algebra, we recommend that they create a table showing the total distance traveled by each train per hour (see table 1). Ask them to look for patterns and generate equations for each train.",12,mtms2010-09-116a(1),,
"Students should be able to see that  by adding 70 and 85 onto the previous distance, respectively, that each constant represents the slope of the  (a)",13,mtms2010-09-116a(1),,

"When students press the graph button, they watch the calculator graph the two lines on the same set of axis, in Sequential mode, which is the default of most calculators. The animation shows Y1, which is train 1, graphed first, followed by the graph of Y2. Changing the mode on the calculator from Sequential to Simultaneous (see fig. 2a) will change the animation that graphs the two lines. Activity sheet 2 uses Simultaneous mode, where both Y1 and Y2 will be graphed at the same time, based on the value of x. When students press the graph button, they get a sense that the trains appear to start from two different locations along the bottom of the screen and are  (b)",16,mtms2010-09-116a(1),,

"Students might be confused as to the problem and its representation. Although both trains leave from the station in Philadelphia, that does not appear to be the case. The speed of the trains is truly reflected in the slopes of the two lines, but it does not show that train 2 is actually traveling faster than train 1. Changing the mode from Function to Parametric will resolve these two concerns.",19,mtms2010-09-116a(1),,
"Parametric mode (see fig. 2a) allows both trains to travel across the screen by using an independent variable, t, to represent time. The variable x represents the distance traveled by each train, and y denotes the track number. Train 1 can be represented as 70t, where t represents the number of hours passed since 12:00. Train 2 can be represented as 85(t – 2), since it left two hours after train 1. (See fig. 2b−2c for help with calculator settings.) trains MovinG  across the screen",20,mtms2010-09-116a(1),,
"We have now reached a discussion point. From the table, it becomes obvious that each train arrives at some point before the eleventh hour. Is it possible that train 2 travels 750 miles before train 1 does? If the average rates for each train are given, is that the speed at which they travel? A student can also observe that the difference between the two trains’ distance is approaching zero. At some point soon, train 2 will catch train 1. Does that matter? We are interested in which train reaches Atlanta (750 miles) first, not where the second train to depart catches up.",21,mtms2010-09-116a(1),,
"The window settings for the parametric equations are seen in figure 2c. Ask the class to determine these window settings with the following questions:  •	 Since	T represents the time in hours  passed, what should be its minimum value? Its maximum value? (Answer: 0 to 11. Also, the Tstep will be changed to start at T = 1.) •	 What	should	be	the	minimum	X	 and Y values? (Answer: The values of X should range from 0 to 750 with a scale of 50.)  •	 What	should	the	Y-range	be	to	see	 the two trains, set as 1 and 2? (Answer: Y should be 0 to 3 with a scale of 1 so that the values of 1 and 2 can be seen.) fig. 3 For students, watching the animated construction of the parametric graph as the two lines/trains move across the screen, rather than observing the resulting graph, is invaluable.",22,mtms2010-09-116a(1),,
"Have students determine which train will reach the right side of the calculator first. Train 1 will be the lower train; train 2, the upper train. The animation on the screen, rather than the graph produced, is valuable to students when they press the Graph key. With Tstep = 1, both trains will travel across the screen very quickly, possibly too fast to determine a “winner.” Lower the Tstep until you are satisfied that students can visually tell which train they think will arrive first (this will likely occur at Tstep = .1).",23,mtms2010-09-116a(1),,
"As a last check, students should  work through the algebra to determine without a doubt which train arrives first. Taking student suggestions may yield	setting	both	X1T	and	X2T equal to 750 to find the time that each train arrives. Some students, noting the patterns on the original table, may wish to solve	X1T	=	X2T (i.e., 70T = 85(T – 2)) to find when the two trains have traveled the same distance, reasoning that train 1 would reach the 750-mile mark first if the solution yields a distance greater than 750 miles.",24,mtms2010-09-116a(1),,
"As an extension, a slightly different  problem can be posed:  What if, by accident, the second train was leaving Atlanta for Philadelphia on the same track? ",25,mtms2010-09-116a(1),,
How much time is there to prevent a collision? At what point on the track would the trains collide? ,26,mtms2010-09-116a(1),,
"Change Y2T to be equal to 1 in  the Y= screen so that both trains are on the same track. What adjustment must be made to Y1T? By watching the calculator, can students determine the time that the two trains will collide?",27,mtms2010-09-116a(1),,
"Although this activity was not conducted as a strict experimental study, some conclusions can be drawn, especially in light of these reactions:  1.  The interest level in the lesson was  one of the highest of that school year thus far.  2.  In the two classes that used the calculator method, the teachers also noticed a higher level of interest and participation.  3.  Students from the traditional  classes consistently questioned why they had not used the calculator method first.  4.  The teachers commented that the  traditional classes could be described as “business as usual.” ",28,mtms2010-09-116a(1),,
The two teachers noted the difference in the students’ motivation. They found that students enjoyed the calculator approach and that opportunities for mathematical discourse presented themselves much more readily when the calculators were used.,29,mtms2010-09-116a(1),,
