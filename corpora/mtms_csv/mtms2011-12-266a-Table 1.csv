"Students nailed down solutions to the Squares and Pegs problem in various ways. Some worked systematically, drawing 1 × 1, 2 × 2, 3 × 3, and 4 × 4 squares that had only horizontal or vertical sides, such as the students in Mary Fay-Zenk’s Math Club (see ﬁ g. 1). Other students made patterns or pictures on the geoboard and tried to cover the geoboard with as many nonoverlapping squares as they could. Jill Pandolﬁ no’s students Jonathan and Naﬁ  produced the diagrams in ﬁ gure 2a and ﬁ gure 2b. ",10,mtms2011-12-266a,,
"Some students began seeing the “diamonds,” or squares that did not have vertical and horizontal sides, such as Brianna, another student in Pandolﬁ no’s class (see ﬁ g. 3). They discussed how to describe the size of these squares and developed a conjecture about which size squares were possible and which were not. Fay-Zenk related their discussion: ",11,mtms2011-12-266a,,
"When asked to describe these squares by the length of their sides, the students applied the Pythagorean theorem and identiﬁ ed the lengths as “root 2” and “root 8.” That led to an aha moment for students; they looked for square roots between 12 and 18 and found the square with a side length of “root 5.” Before long, one of ",12,mtms2011-12-266a,,
"Fig. 4 When students found the remaining squares formed in a 5 × 5 geoboard, they began to connect the Pythagorean theorem to their work.",13,mtms2011-12-266a,,
"(a) (b) the students, Jacob, found the square with length “root 10,” and Connor convinced us that there were no more options. So there were eight differentsize squares possible. ",14,mtms2011-12-266a,,
"Figure 4 shows the additional  squares drawn by Sam and other students in Fay-Zenk’s Math Club. While ﬁ nding a solution, her students discussed the application of the Pythagorean theorem, the difference between counting pegs and distances, and why some side lengths could not be found.
