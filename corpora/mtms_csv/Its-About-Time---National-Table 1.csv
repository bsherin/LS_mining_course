18,Its About Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,b. Which two times are farthest apart from each other? What is the difference between those two times?,,
19,Its About Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,SOLUTIONS,,
20,Its About Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,1. a. No,,
21,Its About Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,b. 240 seconds. Note that 180 seconds is three times as long as 1 minute. Three times longer than 1 min. = 60 sec. + 180 sec. = 240 sec. (The Field-Test Comments from Pamela Haner below shed important insights on how two letters can change the meaning of a sentence.),,
22,Its About Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"c. 300 seconds. Four times longer than 1 minute is 1 min. + 4 min., or 60 sec. + 240 sec. = 300 sec.",,
23,Its About Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"2. Student A’s time seems to be going much slower. For student A, there are 60 • 60, or 3600, seconds in 1 hour, so each second seems like 3600 times as long as it really is. For student B, each day seems like 365 days, or just 365 times as long as it actually is. (The Field-Test Comments from Judy Kraus below shed more light on the solution.)",,
24,Its About Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"3. It took Michael 1.5 times as long. There are 48 minutes from 7:29 p.m. to 8:17 p.m. There are 72 minutes from 6:59 p.m. to 8:11 p.m. Because 72 is 1.5 times as much as 48, it took Michael 1.5 times as long.",,
25,Its About Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"4. B and C. Some students may select choice D rather than choice C. Have those students test a value for s or m in the equations. For example, with C, when m = 1, s = 60. This shows that 1 min. = 60 sec., which is correct. But with D, when s = 1, m = 60. This would suggest that 1 sec. = 60 min., which is incorrect.",,
26,Its About Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"5. a. Swimmer C had the best time, which was 0.39 second faster than swimmer A’s time. It may be helpful for students to put the times in order. Some students may not realize that the smallest number represents the fastest time. The times, in order, from fastest to slowest, are 1:53.94, 1:54.33, 1:54.93, and 1:55.49.",,
27,Its About Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
28,Its About Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,b. The times for swimmer C and B are farthest apart; the difference is 1.55 seconds.,,
29,Its About Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,FIELD-TEST COMMENTS,,
30,Its About Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Ah, the last day of school. My fifth-grade students had completed their end-of-year mastery, so when walking into class on that last Friday, they were not expecting to “work.” The cartoon was displayed on the white board, and students volunteered to read the parts. I asked the first student to reread the panel, reciting it as if she really meant it, and she played it to the hilt. Much laughter erupted, and all the students became invested in the activity. Everyone wanted to weigh in on how long the day seemed, from an eternity to “way too fast for me.”",,
31,Its About Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The focus of the lesson became how to interpret what a question is asking. The students worked with a partner on all parts of problem 1. They were convinced that they knew what they were doing because the problem seemed so straightforward, and the numbers were easy. Even with the “Be careful” admonition, when I asked for answers, I heard several different responses. I said nothing; I let them hash it out among themselves. Finally someone said, slowly, “Three times long– [audible breath between syllables] –er than a minute,” and you could almost see the illumination as the light bulbs turned on. We discussed how even two little letters can make a big difference in the meaning of the sentence. My not jumping in to confirm the correct answer was difficult, but necessary. My students will remember the point long after because they figured it out on their own. The class had practiced this discussion strategy all year, and students were comfortable when I did not give the answer right away.",,
32,Its About Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The class finished the rest of the problems working with their partners and then worked with another pair to check answers. Finally, we confirmed answers as a whole class. For problem 3,after comparing Michael’s time to Gabby’s, we reversed the order of the two times and compared Gabby’s time to Michael’s. That reinforced the concept that different interpretations can give you two different answers that are both correct. It is all in how you look at it. We also discussed forms of answers and why you would use the fraction 2/3 instead of the decimal when reversing the order.",,
33,Its About Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"My students enjoy doing partner work. Even the most reserved students in a whole-class discussion will engage in an activity one-on-one with enough practice. Over the year, their mathematical discourse steadily improved, and they began using more precise vocabulary and details to support conjectures. To them, this activity was not “work.” It was a wonderfully worthwhile way to wrap up the school year. And yes, they did ask if I felt the same as the teacher in the third panel.",,

37,Its About Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Ed. note: Pamela Haner retired at the end of the 2014–2015 school year. We would like to wish her well and thank her for her many years of test-driving Cartoon Corner.,,
38,Its About Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"On the last day of school, my prealgebra sixth graders tackled “It’s About Time.” All calculators had been packed away, and final exams had been completed. The students were ready for summer vacation, yet they sustained a thoughtful discussion about time. The second problem elicited the most varied responses. Students felt that someone who stated that a day felt like a year versus one who described each second feeling like an hour perceived the passage of time as lasting longer. As a figure of speech, a day equating to a year was meant to convey a longer period of time.",,
39,Its About Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Then they decided to look at the math. Calculating 3,600 seconds in an hour and 365 days in a year, they focused on the question, “Is 3,600 times faster or slower than 365 times?” A great debate ensued about units! We then converted days and years to seconds and discovered that there are 86,400 seconds in a day and 31,536,000 seconds in a year. The students then realized that units did not matter since the ratio remained the same, 1:365. The discussion ended with the consensus that the time seemed to be longer when you compared the larger units of years and days, but that the smaller units of seconds and hours mathematically resulted in the actual perception of time passing more slowly.",,

43,Its About Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I used this cartoon with my sixth-grade math classes the last regular day of the school year. Students had a choice to work alone or in small groups. Most chose to work in groups. Students did not use calculators. Time calculation was not a topic that we focused on in sixth grade, so it was interesting to listen to the discussions among the students.",,
44,Its About Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"All students were correct in their answer to question 1a, and all students had incorrect answers for questions 1b and 1c. Each student simply multiplied 3 × 60 for question 1b and 4 × 60 for question 1c. Even when I worked with groups individually and asked them if there was a difference between the phrases “three times longer than a minute” and “three times as long as a minute,” no one realized the difference. This gave me some insight as to how to phrase some questions next year to get students thinking in both these directions.",,
45,Its About Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Students easily answered problems 2 through 5. However, some had trouble with problem 3. Some answered the question “how many more minutes did Michael spend?” rather than “how many times as long?” This was a topic we normally studied when doing circle graphs, but some students did not generalize that previous knowledge to this problem. Almost all students chose the correct equations in problem 4 and correctly solved both parts of problem 5. I had several students in class who were competitive swimmers, so they were able to help those who had questions about the swimmer’s times. I was pleased that they correctly subtracted the times, and I will use this as an example when we study decimals next school year.",,
