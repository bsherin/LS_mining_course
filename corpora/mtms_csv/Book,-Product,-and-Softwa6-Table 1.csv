6,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (February 2016) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","This resource provides a variety of rich problem-solving tasks for student exploration. The book is not intended to be a comprehensive curriculum but is designed to support middle school teachers in implementing the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics. The tasks can be used as warm-up activities to launch a lesson or as group work, offering opportunities to explore mathematical concepts in depth. A discussion of each task offers suggestions for differentiation, provides sample questions that could be asked to support student learning, and indicates which content standards and Standards for Mathematical Practice are covered with each task.",,
7,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (February 2016) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","The tasks are divided according to content strand and could nicely complement a more traditional textbook or curriculum. The particularly strong activities cover number sense and ratio and proportion. They could be used at the start of a unit to help students develop their own conceptual understanding, rather than having students rely on memorization or algorithms.",,
8,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (February 2016) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","One weakness of the book, however, is that none of the pages are reproducible, meaning that teachers will need to transfer the tasks to a format that can be distributed to students. The advantage of this is that teachers can adapt the tasks to differentiate for their students. However, some work must be done before these tasks will be ready for classroom use. This book is valuable for teachers looking for rich activities, who are prepared to carefully adapt them for their classroom practice.",,

15,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (February 2016) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","The explorations presented in this text are not for the faint of heart. They are incredibly challenging. Teachers who assign these activities to their students need to invest time to understand the material, so that they provide for a students successful journey.",,
16,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (February 2016) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics",Many of the ideas in the text will be encountered in high school or college mathematics or in math competitions. Students who have experience with tough puzzles like those in Factors and Multiples will get excited when making prior connections. Students may not only develop a feeling of accomplishment but also become leaders by helping their peers understand the material.,,
17,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (February 2016) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","As students struggle through the factors of numbers, they will come across patterns, make predictions through the patterns, and finally test them. The explorations and puzzles ask students to work forward and backward. Different ways of thinking, diagraming, and finding answers will help the students master factoring at an incredibly high level.",,
18,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (February 2016) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Every exploration lists goals and prior understandings to help the teacher incorporate connections with lesson plans, past and future. The activities are scaffolded so that as the students knowledge becomes deeper, the problems become more challenging and the connections become more apparent. The time-consuming exercises encourage students to look for quicker methods to eliminate possibilities. These explorations will inspire students to begin systematically developing pictures and patterns.",,
19,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (February 2016) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","The wrap-ups at the end of each exploration will help solidify what the students should have learned. Teachers could start at the wrap-up and work backward to save time. One good exploration for this purpose is Exploration 6, finding that the greatest common factor (GCF) of two natural numbers is also the GCF of the difference of the two numbers.",,
20,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (February 2016) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Be wary, teachers, about assigning the extended lessons at the end of the explorations because the answers for these items are included.",,

26,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (February 2016) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","For the intent of this book, I enjoyed the activities and the focus on using an art lens to explore elementary mathematics. There are great ideas for lessons that I could see using in my own classroom. I also love that cross-curricular ideas are stated clearly with usable examples for each lesson. However, my recommendation for this product is that it needs to be revised to make some of the lessons more classroom-ready.",,
27,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (February 2016) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Some of the lessons feel disjointed or lack a clear focus. For example,  the first chapter states that it is a 90-minute lesson or two 45-minute  lessons. However, there are many different topics, such as forms and styles of art, two- and three-dimensional shapes, and perspective, to cover in that short amount of time.",,
28,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (February 2016) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","My recommendation for improvements to make this more teacher-friendly are first to define a specific target grade level. Sometimes the content can cover multiple grades, but for the specified lesson, a grade needs to be defined. The lesson also needs to be connected to a set of Common Core State Standards or NCTM Standards. The authors should be aware that the cross-curricular content connects to the specific grade level, as well. In addition, the lesson needs to fit the time slot given and state a clear, intended goal for the end. Are students just exploring the concepts during class, or is there some sort of application or product at the end? Teachers work well with clear examples that they can tweak for their own classrooms.",,
