29,Is a Double Negative a No-No_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,1. a. No. Each student is wrong because the product of two negative numbers is a positive number.,,
30,Is a Double Negative a No-No_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"b.Sample answer: When the two responses are taken together, â€œNo, Noâ€ could mean â€œYesâ€ because two negatives make a positive in the context of multiplication.",,

33,Is a Double Negative a No-No_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,2.Sample answers:No; it is not a no-no because it is OK to have a double negative. Yes; a double negative is akin to the words no-no.,,

36,Is a Double Negative a No-No_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"b. (i) When x = â€“4, |â€“x â€“ 4| = 0. When x > â€“4, â€“x â€“ 4 is negative, and so its absolute value is positive. When x < â€“4, â€“x â€“ 4 is positive, and its absolute value is positive.",,
37,Is a Double Negative a No-No_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"c. (ii) |x â€“ 4| will always be positive, or 0. But because â€“|x â€“ 4| means â€œthe opposite of |x â€“ 4|,â€ the result will always be negative, or 0. This is because the opposite of a positive number is negative, and the opposite of 0 is 0.",,
38,Is a Double Negative a No-No_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"5. a. No. The sum of two negative numbers cannot be a positive number. Sample explanation: When you add two negative numbers, the sum is smaller than either of the two addends because the second addend puts the sum farther away from 0, to the left on the number line. Suppose you owe someone $5. Then you borrow $3 from that person. You now owe $3 more than before, or â€“$5 + (â€“$3) = â€“$8.",,
39,Is a Double Negative a No-No_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Â,,
40,Is a Double Negative a No-No_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"b.Sample answer: When the negative integer has a larger absolute value than the positive integer, the sum will be negative. For example, â€“8 + 6 = â€“2. When the positive integer has a larger absolute value than the negative number, the sum will be positive. For example, â€“5 + 9 = 4.",,

46,Is a Double Negative a No-No_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,7.  There is no solution. Sample answer: Suppose the printed statement really is false. Then the statement would be true (because it is true that it is false). But suppose the printed statement really is true. Then the statement would be false (because it is false that the statement is false). This problem is a paradox.,,

48,Is a Double Negative a No-No_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Oh no! Watch those double negatives! My sixth-grade prealgebra students felt like Frank and Ernest were speaking to them. While reviewing the rules for integers, students came up with multiple sayings along the way that helped them remember what to do with double negatives, such as â€œI do not not want to goâ€ and â€œAn enemy of my enemy is my friend.â€",,
49,Is a Double Negative a No-No_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In question 4, students determined that the greater absolute value determined the end sign.",,
50,Is a Double Negative a No-No_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"When we were discussing question 5, students mentioned that they connected this problem to language arts. â€œAs you are on a heroâ€™s journey, pick a path and continue.â€ In other words, if you are adding two positives or two negatives, continue in that direction. They realized the change in sign meant a change in direction and could apply the rules correctly.",,
51,Is a Double Negative a No-No_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,The paradoxical question to close the lesson provided a humorous ending to a light-hearted review.,,

55,Is a Double Negative a No-No_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I completed this activity with a seventh-grade class in early October at the beginning of the integers unit. One-third of the students were categorized as special needs, most for reading and mathematics, so I was interested to see how they would answer the questions. We looked at the cartoon together, and I had to explain what a double negative was. Most students did not know that phrase from language arts.",,
56,Is a Double Negative a No-No_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In response to problem 1, all the students stated that when considered separately, each student was incorrect. About half the students initially understood the humor of the cartoon and could explain it. The others just could not make the connection of â€œno and noâ€ being a double negative and that two negatives can make a positive. I found this very interesting because all students except one correctly completed the table with the signs of the products and numerical examples.",,
57,Is a Double Negative a No-No_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The students struggled with the absolute value questions in problem 4. In our sixth-grade mathematics curriculum, we have a small focus on absolute value, so the problems with the (â€“) sign before the absolute value were confusing to them. These types of problems are addressed in seventh grade.",,
58,Is a Double Negative a No-No_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Students could answer problem 5 correctly. Some used numerical expressions, and others drew number lines. They were able to give good examples.",,
59,Is a Double Negative a No-No_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The students worked in pairs or threes to complete problem 6. Each group found answers for each of the four parts. It was interesting to listen to the mathematical conversations as they worked on this question in particular. Some students were unfamiliar with the word â€œconsecutive,â€ so it had to be clarified. I stood back and let students handle it. Once the vocabulary was understood, they were all able to correctly answer the problems. This was also a good reminder to me as a teacher to review vocabulary and clarify terminology.",,

63,Is a Double Negative a No-No_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I used the cartoon â€œIs a Double Negative a No-No?â€ with an eighth-grade class. We were doing a unit on positive and negative numbers, and this was a chance to approach the material in a fresh way. For students who needed more practice multiplying a negative number by a negative number, this was a chance to solidify their thinking. For those who clearly understood the topic, it was a chance to extend their thinking.",,
64,Is a Double Negative a No-No_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Most students benefited from the chance to think about how multiplication and addition with positive and negative numbers were different. Simply stated rules can be easily confused, and this cartoon provided a chance to create greater clarity. Students also benefited from another opportunity to think about absolute values.",,
65,Is a Double Negative a No-No_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I found that completing the table in question 3 was a good exercise for all students in the class. I was glad to see that students needed to complete a â€œNumerical Exampleâ€ column; I think it is important for students to make up their own problems. Question 6 was an excellent extension, requiring students to think about consecutive integers. Students found it a challenge to realize that â€“2, â€“1, 0, and 1 represent a string of consecutive integers! A good challenge.",,
66,Is a Double Negative a No-No_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Students enjoyed considering problem 7, although most found it very difficult.",,

70,Is a Double Negative a No-No_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I tried this problem with my eighth-grade students at the beginning of the school year. Students really appreciated the humor in the cartoon, and many extended the joke into their own lives. One student talked with her partner about how she corrected her mom when she told her baby sister, â€œThatâ€™s a no-no.â€",,
71,Is a Double Negative a No-No_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"My eighth graders found most of the problems fairly simple because sign rules are a skill from seventh grade. Their exploration around problem 6 was a great discussion. We were able to highlight some excellent strategies, like guess and check (with reasoning), what two different pairs really meant, and how the sum of positive and negative numbers differs.",,
