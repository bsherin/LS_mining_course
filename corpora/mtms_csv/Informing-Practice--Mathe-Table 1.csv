The mathematical goals for this problem included— a.  describing and representing  relations and functions using tables, graphs, and rules;  b.  relating and comparing tables,  graphs, and rules as different representations of relationships; and c.  solving multistep linear equations  and inequalities in one variable, solving equations (formulas) for a given variable, and applying these skills to solve practical problems.",91,Informing Practice: Mathematical Practices That Promote Twenty-First Century Skills

Principles and Standards for School Mathematics (NCTM 2000) emphasizes that representations serve as tools for sense making, and for communicating, justifying, and connecting ideas by stating that representations allow students to communicate “mathematical approaches, arguments, and understandings to one’s self and to others,” and to apply “mathematics to realistic problem situations through modeling” (p. 67). Students were asked to create poster proofs in their small groups and to show different ways to represent their solution.

128,Informing Practice: Mathematical Practices That Promote Twenty-First Century Skills,"One important aspect of encouraging the 4Cs in instruction and learning is heightening teacher and student awareness of these skills. Teachers need to be mindful of ways to elicit the 4Cs of communication, collaboration, critical thinking, and creativity by selecting rich problems, providing learning environments, and creating learning structures that amplify these skills. First, selecting a rich problem as a Math Happening that can be solved in multiple ways with multiple mathematical connections can bridge the application of skills to real life. Spending time on a rich problem with a meaningful context may benefit students as they transfer the math skill to a real-life application.",128,Informing Practice: Mathematical Practices That Promote Twenty-First Century Skills
129,Informing Practice: Mathematical Practices That Promote Twenty-First Century Skills,"Second, a learning environment that promotes twenty-first century skills does not happen overnight. A teacher must work with students in a classroom community to show what respecting others’ ideas looks like and sounds like so that the mathematical debate is productive and moves the math agenda forward. To facilitate this type of mathematical dialogue, it is helpful to introduce debate sentence starters in this way: “I would like to offer another strategy . . .” or “I would like to build on my classmate’s idea. . . .” In addition, the learning structures mentioned in this article should be introduced with several examples of modeling and sample student work. Just as one would not expect a new law student to be proficient at knowing how to debate or write legal decisions, one should not assume that students enter the  after students consolidated their work in poster proofs, they went on gallery walks and viewed others’ solution strategies.  representational approach encourages students to solve a problem in a variety of ways. Once students approached a problem in one way, we asked each to develop a Venn diagram showing how he or she solved the problem. They then worked with a partner and compared strategies. Teachers and students can use the Venn diagram strategy to promote the third and fourth Standard for Mathematical Practice in CCSSM: “Construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others” (p. 6).  Students also communicate their mathematical ideas by modeling the mathematics using various representations (concrete tools, pictures and diagrams, tables, graphs, numbers, or verbal descriptions).

130,Informing Practice: Mathematical Practices That Promote Twenty-First Century Skills,"By collaborating on a Venn dia- gram, students compare and contrast strategies and think critically about how different strategies may be efficient or easier to understand. Figure 5b shows how two students approached the problem differently. Although one created a diagram and crossed off quantities and the other made a table, they found the same answer. By allowing students to compare strategies, they learn to appreciate each other’s perspective, connect their strategy to another’s while evaluating its efficiency and clarity, and look  to make sense of problems by viewing and critiquing the approaches of others.  cReative thinKing thRoUgh Math haPPenings Finally, to encourage creativity, students were asked to create a similar Math Happening that connected to the mathematics that they learned through the MP3 purchase plan problem. For example, problems related to other plans—cell phone, video game, or savings—were all possibilities. The task of writing a Math Happening encouraged not only problem solving but also the art of problem posing. Its related question required creativity, critical thinking, and the “doing and undoing” of a problem. After solving the given MP3 problem, students had to think back to all the discrete parts that were essential so that they could pose a comparable problem. In this case, it required students to think about a purchase plan with varying rates of change in the cost of the items.  a venn diagRaM stRategy",130,Informing Practice: Mathematical Practices That Promote Twenty-First Century Skills

135,Informing Practice: Mathematical Practices That Promote Twenty-First Century Skills,"Another essential aspect of promoting twenty-first century skills in the math classroom is to help students understand the 4Cs and be able to self-assess and peer-assess across these four dimensions. Periodically, teachers can ask students to self-assess and peer-assess using prompts like those in table 2 after a problem-solving task. These prompts allow students to reflect on how much an individual contributed to the learning experience and recognize the contributions of others. Assessing student skills and knowledge is essential to guide learning and provide feedback to both students and teachers about how well they are doing in reaching desired twenty-first century skills (Trilling and Fadel 2009). Formative assessment strategies such as selfassessment and peer-assessment can  empower students to take more of an active role in improving their twentyfirst century skills performance.
