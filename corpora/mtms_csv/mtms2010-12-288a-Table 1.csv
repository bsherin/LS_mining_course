"Middle school mathematics teachers face unprecedented challenges. Foremost among those challenges is being able to systematically adapt instructional practices to advance student achievement relative to rigorous math standards. In the vast majority of cases, teachers work in isolation while shouldering the demands of a full schedule, large class sizes, and numerous professional responsibilities. These challenges are not likely to be overcome by individual teachers.  a Professional collaboration Model",2,mtms2010-12-288a,,
"That said, it is widely argued that  collaborative efforts are needed to achieve excellence in mathematics classrooms (e.g., Martin 2007; Sagor 1992). A model for grade-level collaborative teams of mathematics teachers was developed to both structure and foster professional collaboration in support of student learning. It was motivated by research fi ndings suggesting that professional collaboration results in positive changes to instructional practices and improved student  performance (Borko 2004; David 2008/2009). The model also features a well-defi ned structure to guide the collaborative teams (e.g., Rottier 2001).",3,mtms2010-12-288a,,
What goes into the Model?,4,mtms2010-12-288a,,
"This model was developed at a middle school in a large Maryland school district that has approximately 1000 students across grades 6, 7, and 8. It consists of four well-defi ned team processes (see fi g. 1) that are purposefully aligned with the attributes found in professional learning communities (e.g., DuFour and Eaker 1998). Analyzing student progress is at the heart of the model and essentially drives the other team processes. A description of each component follows.",5,mtms2010-12-288a,,
"1. Monitor curriculum implementation. Course outcomes are unwrapped before the start of each instructional unit following procedures developed by Ainsworth (2003). As a result, ",6,mtms2010-12-288a,,

Once the unit is under way, team members work together to uniformly implement the curriculum across all courses.  2. Analyze student progress. This component is vital to getting good results. Formative and summative assessments are developed for each math course shared by team members. They agree on a set of performance criteria as the basis for judging student progress. Rubrics are selected or created for  constructed-response (or open-ended) items, and anchor responses for each score point are identified. To ensure high levels of objectivity in the scoring process, teachers score the responses of students enrolled in their teammates’ classes, not their own. Collaborative analyses of assessment results are guided by an activity sheet designed to prompt searches for patterns in the data and to foreshadow next steps (see fig. 2). Analyses of students’ progress are often extended by using a generic five-step procedure for examining student work (see fig. 3). The procedure  is typically applied to students who were found to have a learning problem after a formative assessment was completed. Instructional interventions identified by the team in the process of examining a focus student’s work are applied to all students who exhibit the same learning problem on the assessment.",9,mtms2010-12-288a,,
"3. Identify curriculum approaches. Team members adjust the pace, the sequence of course topics, and the course content in accordance with their analyses of student progress. Adjustments of this nature include both content and product instructional differentiation (Tomlinson 1999). For example, if a formative assessment reveals students at high levels of readiness relative to the topic under study, the team may decide to differentiate instruction by teaching the corresponding course content to them in more depth or via open-ended explorations of multifaceted or unstructured mathematics tasks (Smith and Stein 1998).",10,mtms2010-12-288a,,
"4. Design/identify instructional strategies and interventions. Team members share, discuss, or plan collaboratively. They generate lessons, instructional activities, assignments, and projects in which to engage their students. When strategies and interventions are crafted on the basis of analyses of student progress, the full potential of team collaboration can be realized. The search for better ways to change student performance leads to changes in teachers’ instructional practices. When new strategies are tested, subsequent team discussions are oriented toward desired results as the effects of the strategies on student learning are addressed.",11,mtms2010-12-288a,,
Team meetings are organized around four agenda items mirroring the four defining team processes. ,12,mtms2010-12-288a,,

"Collaborative teacher teams do not usually engage in all four at a typical meeting. In addition, the processes are not given equal weight in team deliberations. The first five to ten minutes of every meeting is normally used to monitor curriculum implementation; the remainder of the time is spent with pressing needs such as collaboratively scoring a formative assessment task. Underlying the work of every team is a clear focus on improved student performance through systematic assessments of progress and adjustments to instructional practices based on those assessments.",16,mtms2010-12-288a,,

A meeting scenario is described. This meeting is derived from a compilation of minutes and observations of other team gatherings. These minutes  represent the collaborative efforts undertaken by mathematics teachers at the school.,18,mtms2010-12-288a,,
Background,19,mtms2010-12-288a,,
"The sixth-grade unit on ratio and proportion is under way. Earlier, the sixthgrade team agreed that the curriculum goals to be emphasized were going to be students’ ability to “develop, analyze, and explain methods for solving problems involving proportions” (NCTM 2000, p. 214). Unit planning involved these concepts and processes:  •	 Discussing	ratio	and	proportion, •	 Recognizing	proportional	situations, •	 Identifying	valid	proportional	relationships from given information, and  •	 Solving	proportions	for	the	missing component. ",20,mtms2010-12-288a,,
"At the halfway mark in the unit, the team created and administered a formative assessment that included the following constructed-response item, targeting the focus objective. It is an open-ended task known as “Mr. Tall/",21,mtms2010-12-288a,,

"The task was initially created by Karplus, Karplus, and Wollman (1974) to investigate students’ proportional reasoning and was purposefully designed to compel students to use data and rely less on intuition (p. 480). The team agreed to analyze student responses for “Mr. Tall/Mr. Short” during the next scheduled meeting. In advance of the meeting, team members exchanged student papers to be scored. They decided to apply the R/M Split Rubric (see fig. 4) to the constructed-response items to help identify students’ instructional needs (Bush and Leinwand 2000).",29,mtms2010-12-288a,,
"Open the Meeting The meeting begins by teachers stating where their classes are relative to the established time line (or pacing guide) for the unit. At this point, students should be immersed in a variety of problems involving proportion:  comparing ratios (part-whole, two parts of a single whole), comparing rates, and working through scaling. A quick check verifies that this is the case, and the team then addresses the day’s agenda items: Analyze student progress relative to solving problems involving proportions and identify  instructional strategies and interventions that respond to students’ needs.

"The	response	must	either	accomplish	the	task	or	provide	convincing	evidence	 of the mathematical power to do so.

"Source:	Adapted	from	Bush	and	Leinwand	2000,	p.	104 commences. Papers are passed around, insights are shared, and a common pattern is identified.

Here is one student’s response:",40,mtms2010-12-288a,,
"Well if Mr. Short is 4 large buttons and in paper clips he is 6, then 4 buttons and 6 paper clips are equal so Mr. tall is 6 large buttons so if 4 and 6 equal Mr. Short, Mr Tall is two more paper clips so that makes it 8 clips.",41,mtms2010-12-288a,,
"Further, the team finds that in these instances a proportion was not applied to find a solution. They decide to examine students’ responses in more depth. ",42,mtms2010-12-288a,,
"Reading through the explanations  given by students multiple times, the team makes several observations. Team members note that the students incorrectly applied additive reasoning; since the difference in Mr. Short’s height when measured in paper clips versus buttons is 2, the same must apply to Mr. Tall. Thus, the students concluded that Mr. Tall must be  2 paper clips more in height than when measured in buttons, which is how they arrived at an answer of  6 + 2 = 8. The proportional relationship of 3 paper clips to 2 buttons was ignored. The team also notes that the students did not use pictures, diagrams, or tables to help them make sense of the problem situation. ",43,mtms2010-12-288a,,
Identify Strategies,44,mtms2010-12-288a,,
"The meeting continues, with discussion now directed toward instruction that is tailored to specific student needs. The in-depth examination of the student work suggests that they either misconstrued the nature of proportional relationships or were unable to recognize them. In addition, the lack of drawings and diagrams is judged by the team to be inconsistent  with six graders’ need to model situations, concretely or pictorially, to solve problems successfully (Van de Walle and Lovin 2006). ",45,mtms2010-12-288a,,
"The team brainstorms and settles  on two instructional interventions. The first intervention is designed to foster quantitative reasoning that can be applied to proportional situations (e.g., use of composite units, a scalar factor, or equivalent fractions) by modeling various representations with manipulatives, pictures, diagrams, or tables. Students are then assigned a problem set and directed to devise, individually or in small groups, their own representations en route to finding solutions. The intended outcomes are for students to use their representations to construct an understanding of how measures vary together in proportional situations and to experience multiplicative reasoning (Langrall and Swafford 2000). ",46,mtms2010-12-288a,,
"The second intervention focuses  on students’ ability to recognize situations in which proportions apply. The team decides to engage students in a guided discovery lesson based on a series of exercises. In these exercises, situations involving proportional relationships are placed intermittently among those that do not (see fig. 5). The problem set is assigned to small groups of three or four; the continued use of drawings, diagrams, tables, or manipulatives to represent problem conditions is encouraged. ",47,mtms2010-12-288a,,
"Students then share solutions  in a large group. The ensuing class dialogue focuses on attributes of problems that distinguish them as proportional relationships. Generally speaking, these include ratio comparison and missing-value situations where quantities vary together in  such a way that ratios are invariant (Lamon 2007). In addition, the direct-multiplicative relationship among quantities in the proportional situations is compared with the ad-",48,mtms2010-12-288a,,

"The teachers spend the final ten to fifteen minutes on logistics.

In addition, team members agree to gather additional assessment items to judge the effectiveness of their planned interventions.",56,mtms2010-12-288a,,
"oBseRVed BeneFits On the basis of qualitative and quantitative data gathered over four years, the model for teacher collaboration described here positively impacts curriculum implementation, teacher work relationships, assessment and instructional practices, and student performance. Implementing state and district mathematics curricula becomes uniform with respect to pacing  and the math content and processes emphasized. In addition, the program disparities that often trouble parents disappear. ",57,mtms2010-12-288a,,
"Teachers’ work relationships become more open and positive. Favorite lesson activities are no longer hoarded. Instead, ideas are freely shared, and mutual commitments to improve steadily grow. Applying formative assessments to gauge student progress en route to learning becomes a regular part of teachers’ assessment practices. Assessment results are used to identify needed adjustments to instruction and routinely generate significant changes in teachers’ instructional practices. Finally, steady gains in student performance are achieved. For instance, at the middle school where the model was designed, cooperative learning, problem-based instruction, and guided discovery are more widely and consistently implemented in math classrooms. The results of math assessments show that performance levels at the school  are well above benchmarks set for adequate yearly progress.  conclUsions",58,mtms2010-12-288a,,
"Professional collaboration furthers adoption of standards-based practices and results in improved student performance. Nonetheless, math teachers continue for the most part to work in isolation. Exacerbating this situation is the absence of structures and processes to guide and support the work of collaborative teams.",59,mtms2010-12-288a,,
"The model outlined in figure 1 features four collaborative processes that effectively direct the work of math-teacher teams. Although the model was developed to address improvement goals at a relatively large middle school, it can be adapted for smaller schools and made to work with a variety of school schedules. After all, it only takes two to form a team, and there are many ways to carve out time for teachers to collaborate. ",60,mtms2010-12-288a,,
"Middle schools with one or fewer  mathematics teachers assigned to each grade might consider making the entire department their collaborative team. This situation offers teachers regular opportunities to ensure implementation of a cohesive mathematics program across the grades. In addition, the school could form a consortium with sister schools to accommodate professional collaboration. ",61,mtms2010-12-288a,,
"Given the research in support of  teacher collaboration and the demonstrated success of the model detailed here, readers are encouraged to actively pursue teacher collaboration at their schools. Adopt this model, adapt it to the prevailing conditions at your school, or design a collaborative structure of your own. Prepare in advance by agreeing on the processes that will guide the work of your collaborative teams—how team members will focus their efforts to achieve mathematics learning goals. Solicit the support of school administration to secure the resources needed for productive teaming, the most important of which is time. Teacher collaboration is a proven  construct for effecting positive changes in instructional practices and student performance. No doubt, you will find that the time and effort you put into it will be both professionally rewarding and extremely beneficial for your students.",62,mtms2010-12-288a,,
