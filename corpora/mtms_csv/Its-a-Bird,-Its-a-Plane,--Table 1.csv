0,"Its a Bird, Its a Plane, Its a Dilated Superhero - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","The more connections that students can make between mathematical content and the real world, the better they will become at developing critical thinking and understanding mathematics. This lesson on exploring geometric dilations encourages small cooperative-group critiques and connections to an abundance of middle school math concepts. Graphing proportional relationships and finding the constant of proportionality are big ideas in middle school mathematics. This two-part lesson connects these ideas and many more Common Core State Standards (CCSSI 2010) through fun, student-driven activities.",,
1,"Its a Bird, Its a Plane, Its a Dilated Superhero - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","For this activity, each student will need a copy of activity sheets 1 and 2. Each group of students will also need these items:",,

8,"Its a Bird, Its a Plane, Its a Dilated Superhero - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics",PART 1: CREATING SUPERHEROES,,
9,"Its a Bird, Its a Plane, Its a Dilated Superhero - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","In the first part of the lesson, students use a flashlight to dilate figures and plot the relationship between a figure and its shadow to find a rule that algebraically defines the dilation. Then students will develop a new rule and use it to make shadows with a specific height. This part of the lesson takes forty-five minutes.",,
10,"Its a Bird, Its a Plane, Its a Dilated Superhero - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Introduce the lesson by asking the class to list the characteristics that comprise a superhero. Students should be encouraged to generate as many attributes as possible, thus helping them realize that these individuals are larger than normal people. This activity shows students how large they could become if they were superheroes.",,
11,"Its a Bird, Its a Plane, Its a Dilated Superhero - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Begin the enlarging activity by asking students to tape together several sheets of light-colored bulletin board paper to cover most of a classroom wall. Tell the students that they are going to create a mural of themselves as dilated superheroes. Have students work in pairs, rotating duties. Taking turns, one student should stand one foot from the paper. His or her partner should trace the student’s shadow onto the paper with a marker. (The student tracing may need to stand on a chair.) Another pair of two students will place the flashlight on the floor, about four feet in front of the student, tilted up slightly so that the light casts a shadow on the papered wall. Dim some of the classroom lights, if necessary. Begin with the tallest student to determine the distance to place the flashlight for the best shadow heights, according to the size of the wall and space in the classroom.",,
12,"Its a Bird, Its a Plane, Its a Dilated Superhero - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Once the best distance from the flashlight to the student is determined (in our case, it was four feet), tell the students to keep this distance consistent and have them begin drawing each individual and labeling each shadow with the appropriate student name. Eventually, some students may have to kneel to fit in the mural. Be sure they remain one foot from the paper and keep the flashlight at the same distance as used for the other students. Move the flashlight parallel to the wall so that it is directly in front of the student being enlarged. Students should have about one minute each to outline the superhero shadows on the paper.",,
13,"Its a Bird, Its a Plane, Its a Dilated Superhero - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","After the students have been traced and their dilated figures identified, have students find the initial height of each superhero and the subsequent dilated height. Remember that some students were kneeling; therefore, their initial height measurements should be taken while kneeling. Have the paired teams fill in the table of values with columns labeled “Initial Height” and “Dilated Height” (activity sheet 1, see question 2) Label a coordinate grid with the x-axis with initial height and the y-axis with dilated height (both in inches). The students then plot their own coordinates from the table of values, using their initials to label the plotted point (see question 3).",,
14,"Its a Bird, Its a Plane, Its a Dilated Superhero - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Before the students use a yardstick to form a line of best fit, ask the class this question: “If the original figure were 0 inches tall, how many inches would it be after dilation?” Make sure they understand that (0, 0) should be plotted and that every best-fit line they devise should go through the origin. Step aside and let students generate their line. Encourage the class to judge the placement of the yardstick so that it fits the data as exact as possible. Once everyone agrees, draw the line of best fit.",,
15,"Its a Bird, Its a Plane, Its a Dilated Superhero - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","The teacher should state that the plotted points were not linear because there were some errors in measuring and slight differences with flashlight placement. As the final step for this part of the lesson, ask students to generate an equation for their line in the form y = kx. Discuss that the relationship is proportional because the data go through the origin and form a line.",,
16,"Its a Bird, Its a Plane, Its a Dilated Superhero - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Find the equation of the proportional relationship. Ask students to replace x and y in the formula y = kx with a coordinate that falls on the line of best fit. Once students find k, the constant of proportionality, they can then check the new equation by plugging in another coordinate. In our case, the tested points had to come from the line of best fit, which did not include all the scattered points.",,
17,"Its a Bird, Its a Plane, Its a Dilated Superhero - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Discuss with students that the constant of proportionality is multiplied by the student’s initial height to get the dilated height on the mural. After the class understands that they find k by dividing y by x, have them select other student coordinates that are actually on the line of best fit to see if k is the same. They can replace the x and y variables in the equation y = kx with the x and y components from the point selected and then find k by dividing y by x. Discuss the results.",,
18,"Its a Bird, Its a Plane, Its a Dilated Superhero - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","The discussion led to an equation close to y = 1.375x (with our class setup). The constant of proportionality for the relationship of initial height to the dilated height was 1.375 (see the photograph on p. 499), meaning that each student’s height in this class was dilated by a scale factor of 1.375. In this situation, I explained that the shadows were 37.5 percent taller than the original measurement. Ask students, “If one grew by 37.5 percent, would this amount be a percentage of increase or decrease?”",,
19,"Its a Bird, Its a Plane, Its a Dilated Superhero - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics",PART 2: ANALYZING SUPERHEROES,,
20,"Its a Bird, Its a Plane, Its a Dilated Superhero - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","The second part of the lesson took another forty-five minutes of class time. We began by telling the class about Captain America’s dilation. He was originally 5 feet 4 inches. After he was dilated, he became 6 feet 2 inches. Have the students create a line using grid paper to represent the dilation. First, ask them to convert the heights into inches rather than feet and inches. Then, ask the students to draw two points on a coordinate grid, (0, 0) and (64, 74). Next, ask them to draw a line and find the equation y = kx.",,
21,"Its a Bird, Its a Plane, Its a Dilated Superhero - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Remind the students how to find k. This multiplier has many names: scale factor, constant of proportionality, rate of change, and the slope of the line. The relationship is proportional, so students just have to find k by dividing y by x. The equation for Captain America’s dilation is y = 1.15625x. The students next have to determine how far away to place the light to produce a dilation shadow. Select three students to find the location for the light source, so that a student’s shadow will be 1.15625 times his or her height. Ask the rest of the class to observe. Affix a tape measure to the door so that the before-and-after heights can be acquired easily. Ask students to place their heel one foot from the door.",,
22,"Its a Bird, Its a Plane, Its a Dilated Superhero - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Have the class predict what each individual dilated height will be, with the equation y = 1.15625x. Then, ask them to check it. Without moving the flashlight, ask each student to give his or her height so that the class can determine what the shadow’s height will be. In so doing, the students can evaluate their understanding while working with classmates before actually determining if the light activity will give a correct shadow height. When they move the flashlight, they can determine if their dilated height predictions were indeed correct.",,
23,"Its a Bird, Its a Plane, Its a Dilated Superhero - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics",EXTENSIONS,,
24,"Its a Bird, Its a Plane, Its a Dilated Superhero - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","At the end of part 1 of this lesson, ask students to find the dilation scale factor for a shrinking activity. “What would our constant of proportionality be if we were to start with the height of the shadows and generate the actual height of each student?” Ask students to start a new table of values, switching the components of x and y. If the first equation generated was y = 1.2x, then the new equation, or the inverse, should be y = (5/6)x. They should rewrite the original equation y = 1.2x as y = (6/5)x. Discuss the similarities and differences of the two. Approximate the inverse function as y = 0.83x and indicate that the heights of the students were 17 percent less than their shadows’ heights. The percentage of increase or decrease is how far the constant of proportionality is from 1.0.",,
25,"Its a Bird, Its a Plane, Its a Dilated Superhero - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","For another extension after part 2, introduce the unit rate for the proportional relationship. The point (1, r) can be found with y = 1.15625x, where r is the unit rate for the situation, meaning that the superhero’s height increases 1.15625 inches for every 1 inch increase in the student’s height.",,
26,"Its a Bird, Its a Plane, Its a Dilated Superhero - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics",A final extension is to connect to similar right triangles. Explain that students can determine that there are three similar triangles formed with one of the shadow dilations (see fig. 1). The light to the top of the shadow is the hypotenuse of one of the triangles that encompasses the other two. The smaller triangle has a hypotenuse that starts from the top of the student’s head and ends at the top of the shadow of the student’s head on the door. The last triangle’s hypotenuse is formed from the light to the top of the student’s head.,,

28,"Its a Bird, Its a Plane, Its a Dilated Superhero - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","It is important for teachers to step out of the box and promote real-life problem solving in the classroom. These types of activities accelerate, enrich, and challenge both students and teachers. Hands-on activities such as this have invigorated me as a teacher. Real-life activities help to keep my math students growing and happily learning, constantly looking ahead and learning more than test prep can ever offer.",,
