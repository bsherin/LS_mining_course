introducing volume 13: a new look,0,mtms2007-08-3a,,
"Mathematics Teaching in the Middle School has a new look! What an exciting way to start the new year! Whether you are a student, a teacher, or an administrator, we all get excited about beginning a new school year. Students get a new book bag, fun school supplies, and perhaps new clothes and new hairstyles. Teachers and administrators have worked all summer preparing new lessons, securing and organizing resources, and planning for the new school year. Everyone at NCTM working with MTMS has been busy, as well. You will find updated fonts, new layout styles, additional focused departments, and more ways to address the teaching and learning of mathematics in the classroom. ",1,mtms2007-08-3a,,
"Although we hope you enjoy the new  look, we want to assure you that we at MTMS remain true to our mission of— •	 supporting the improvement of grades 5–9 mathematics education by serving as a resource for practicing and prospective teachers, as well as supervisors and teacher educators; and  •	 being a forum for the exchange of mathematical ideas, activities, and pedagogical strategies, and for sharing and interpreting research.",2,mtms2007-08-3a,,
"As such, we bring you volume 13 of MTMS. In it, you will find a series of articles with a spotlight on the Curriculum Focal Points for Prekindergarten through Grade 8 Mathematics: A Quest for Coherence. In addition, in the spring, a department that delves into critical issues about curriculum will be introduced. Both are meant to provide a forum for thinking about key areas of our mathematics curriculum as we  continue to prepare our students for their role in society. ",3,mtms2007-08-3a,,
"This issue debuts a new depart- ment, “Mathematical Explorations.” It will contain an activity and worksheets for classroom use. Beginning in September, the popular “Cartoon Corner” will have a new format. The intent is to provide classroom teachers with a field-tested selection of engaging problems that are ready to use. ",4,mtms2007-08-3a,,
"MTMS will continue to bring you challenging problems and activities through departments such as the “Palette of Problems” (formerly “Menu of Problems” ) and “Solve It!” in conjunction with “The Thinking of Students.” Current research, timely topics, and critical issues facing middle school mathematics educators today will continue to be addressed in departments such as “Families Ask,” “Mathematical Roots,” “Take Time for Action,” “Quick Takes” (formerly “Short Takes”), “Readers Write,” “International Perspectives,” and “On My Mind.” ",5,mtms2007-08-3a,,
