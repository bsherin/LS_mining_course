"When learning the order of operations, students are instructed to adhere to the directive above when determining the numerical value of an arithmetic expression. A more typical approach is the use of a popular mnemonic called PEDMAS (parentheses, exponents, division, multiplication, addition, subtraction) or BEDMAS (brackets and so on).

THE TRUTH ABOUT,5,mtms2011-03-414a,,
PEDMASJerry A. Ameis,6,mtms2011-03-414a,,
The literature is scant on conceptual approaches to teaching order of operations. The approaches do not involve students developing a signifi cant understanding of why the indicated order should be followed or under what conditions it should be followed. The emphasis is on students following PEDMAS (or variants) in a prescribed manner.,7,mtms2011-03-414a,,
"Rambhia’s (2002) article contains  an example. A word problem is briefl y discussed that can help students appreciate why multiplication seems to have priority over addition, but the article does not provide depth or answer  this question: Does one always have to do all the multiplication before any addition can be done? The article mentions these four levels of order: ",8,mtms2011-03-414a,,
Level 1: { [ ( ) ] },9,mtms2011-03-414a,,
Level 2: Exponents,10,mtms2011-03-414a,,
Level 3: Multiplication and division,11,mtms2011-03-414a,,
Level 4: Addition and subtraction,12,mtms2011-03-414a,,
"Although these levels could be promising in terms of developing a conceptual understanding of the order of operations, the article does not explain the existence of those levels. It mentions students identifying  “multiplicative” clumps of an expression, such as  2 × 3(4 + 5),  to simplify and break down the expression into more manageable pieces. However, in the fi nal analysis, students are instructed to follow the hierarchy of the levels without any development of why they should do so or whether alternative processing is also possible (and valid). Rambhia expresses the core instructional intent this way: “Organizing the order of operations into a table format allows ",13,mtms2011-03-414a,,

pedMas and stUdent errors,18,mtms2011-03-414a,,
PEDMAS and its variants do not encourage conceptual understanding of the order of operations. They may also partially explain why students make particular mistakes in arithmetic and in corresponding algebraic forms. Two examples follow. ,19,mtms2011-03-414a,,
Figure 1a shows how students  might incorrectly obtain a value for the expression 25 16 5 4+5 4 5 4,20,mtms2011-03-414a,,
"One explanation for this error is that PEDMAS states that division must be done before addition. Figure 1b illustrates how students might incorrectly solve 59 + 4. One explanation is that PEDMAS states that exponentiation must be done before addition. These two incorrect solutions show that the division bar and the radical symbol are confusing to students. It is important to emphasize to students that these items are considered grouping symbols and are to be considered in the same way as a bracket or a parenthesis, in addition to the operation they imply.  the MYth oF pedMas as a MatheMatical law",21,mtms2011-03-414a,,
The K−8 preservice teachers that I teach typically view PEDMAS as a mathematical law because of the way they were taught. This viewpoint should be reconstructed if they are to become more effective in developing student understanding of the order of operations.,22,mtms2011-03-414a,,
"To begin, I ask the preservice  teachers to provide several arithmetic expressions of varying complexity, then obtain values by applying ",23,mtms2011-03-414a,,
"PEDMAS backward (subtraction, addition, and so on).",24,mtms2011-03-414a,,
"After I obtain a value for an expression by applying a non-PEDMAS sequence of calculations (see fi g. 2), the preservice teachers work out a value in the normal PEDMAS manner. They are amazed that the two values are the same. Thus begins the journey into deconstructing the PEDMAS myth and establishing a conceptual understanding of the order of operations. ",25,mtms2011-03-414a,,
"The approach used to develop a conceptual understanding involves two overlapping aspects:  1.  A hierarchy-of-operators triangle,  and  2.  Any-which-way processing (leftto-right processing is not a mathematical law either).",26,mtms2011-03-414a,,
"The development of these two aspects allows the preservice teachers to experience learning through problem solving (unfortunately, an experience distinctly different from how they learned mathematics). These aspects also give examples of ways to develop a conceptual understanding of the order of operations. ",27,mtms2011-03-414a,,
"To help develop the hierarchy-of- operators triangle and any-which-way processing, I tell Rocky the Squirrel stories. Although intended for adults and somewhat corny, they illustrate how a story can be used to help teach mathematics.  the addition and MUltiplication sitUation",28,mtms2011-03-414a,,
I begin with a story that involves an addition and multiplication situation. The story is also intended to provide an example of where left-to-right processing is incorrect.,29,mtms2011-03-414a,,
"Fall was coming. Rocky was a “leave it for another day” kind of squirrel. He did things only when pushed into action, usually by his ",30,mtms2011-03-414a,,
Left-to-right Left-to-right processing is  not a  mathematical  law.,31,mtms2011-03-414a,,
"wife. Today was no different. She said, using a most sarcastic tone, “So, waiting for the acorns to grow into trees, are you?” Rocky knew that tone well. He scrambled to his feet and began gathering and storing acorns. He put 7 acorns in a hole under the beech tree, followed by 2 piles of 6 acorns each in a split in the old cottonwood tree. He proudly told his wife that he was hard at work. She asked, “How many acorns have you stored?”",32,mtms2011-03-414a,,
"To answer the question in the story, I fi rst ask my students to represent ",33,mtms2011-03-414a,,
"Rocky’s efforts with an arithmetic expression. Responses usually include 7 + 2 × 6, 2 × 6 + 7, and 6 + 6 + 7. I then ask which expression most accurately represents the time sequence of events and the exact way that Rocky stored the acorns. We eventually agree that the expression 7 + 2 × 6 best represents the activity in the story.",34,mtms2011-03-414a,,
"I ask students to work out an  answer to the expression. About half of them add 7 and 2 and multiply the sum by 6, obtaining a result of 54. Others multiply 2 by 6 and then add 7 to the product, obtaining 19 as the number of acorns. I do not indicate right or wrong at this point.",35,mtms2011-03-414a,,
"I then ask a student to draw a  picture of the situation on the white board (see fi g. 3). After the students have agreed that the drawing is appropriate, I ask them to count the number of stored acorns indicated by the picture. They count 19. This result is compared with the two results obtained previously. The students conclude that 7 + 2 × 6 must equal 19, because that result agrees with the total in the drawing. ",36,mtms2011-03-414a,,
We discuss which operation has  priority and when. The crucial matter developed through our discussion is ,37,mtms2011-03-414a,,
Fig. 3 A pictorial representation of rocky’s acorn gathering provides insight into applying an order of operations to 7 + 2 × 6.,38,mtms2011-03-414a,,
"erwise, addition can be done before  division. The deeper understanding being developed (and in the addition and multiplication situation beforehand) is that priority of operation depends on the particulars of a situation rather than on the order dictated by PEDMAS or the hierarchy-ofoperators triangle. For example, even in a simple expression, such as  2 + 12 ÷ 4 + 5 + 7, one does not have to do the division before the addition. One can calculate 2 + 5 + 7, then add that result to  12 ÷ 4.",39,mtms2011-03-414a,,
the sUbtraction with MUltiplication or division sitUation,40,mtms2011-03-414a,,
"We next discuss the situations of multiplication and subtraction and of division and subtraction. The preservice teachers see addition and subtraction as similar operations. For this reason, they have little difficulty concluding that multiplication has priority over subtraction and division has priority over subtraction when the choice of “belonging to” occurs. All these conclusions are recorded on the hierarchy-of-operators triangle (see fig. 4b).",41,mtms2011-03-414a,,

the addition and division sitUation,44,mtms2011-03-414a,,
"Rocky stories are also employed when addition and division are considered. Once again, students draw pictures, count the acorns, and compare the picture count with the results obtained by evaluating the expressions that represent the stories. The conclusion we reach is that division takes priority over addition only when a number appears to have the choice of belonging to “divide” or belonging to “add.” Oth-",45,mtms2011-03-414a,,
"Fig. 4 In (a), a multiplication and addition hierarchy shows who is boss. Shared boss duties are highlighted in the addition, multiplication, division, and subtraction hierarchy shown in (b).",46,mtms2011-03-414a,,
"(a)  (b) that the number 2 in the 7 + 2 × 6 expression is faced with a choice. It can belong to the “7 +” or the “× 6.” When that choice occurs in an expression, multiplication has priority over addition. We obtain values for more complex expressions to strengthen the understanding that multiplication has priority over addition only when a choice between the two operations is involved.",47,mtms2011-03-414a,,
"I conclude by drawing a triangle  and calling it the hierarchy-of-operators triangle (an appropriate label for middle-grades students could be the boss triangle, because one operation is a boss over the other), and then record the first conclusion (see fig. 4a).",48,mtms2011-03-414a,,
"To deconstruct further the simplistic PEDMAS thinking that multiplication is done first, no matter what, I tell another Rocky story. The resulting expression involves more than one addition (for example,  2 + 5 × 4 + 3). Once again, I ask students to draw a picture of the situation; they obtain an answer of 25 acorns. We discuss various ways of processing 2 + 5 × 4 + 3 to help them realize that the numbers 2 and 3 can be added before, but separately from, the multiplication of 5 × 4. This reinforces the important point that multiplication is “boss” over addition, only when a number has the choice of belonging to “add” or belonging to  eQUal prioritY For addition and sUbtraction",49,mtms2011-03-414a,,
"Not surprisingly, most preservice teachers challenge the pairings of + and – and of × and ÷ at the same level. PEDMAS and their past mathematics learning experiences have led them to believe that addition and subtraction or multiplication and division do not have equal priority. ",50,mtms2011-03-414a,,
"Deconstructing the myth that addition has higher priority than subtraction is fairly simple. Telling a story, such as that “Rocky buried 3 acorns, his son ate 2, Rocky hid 7 more acorns, the neighbor stole 1, and so on,” provides a context for arithmetic expressions and drawings. The teachers then realize that addition and subtraction have equal priority. In relation to this, one small misconception sometimes emerges during any-which-way processing of arithmetic expressions. Some preservice teachers view an addition and subtraction symbol as rooted in place, rather than considering that it is attached to the number it precedes. In 5 − 3 + 4, some switch the 3 with the 4 (obtaining 5 − 4 + 3), rather than switching the + 4 with the – 3 (obtaining 5 + 4 – 3). This misconception is addressed by reconnecting the story to the arithmetic expression that represents it (e.g., Did Rocky eat 4 acorns or 3 acorns?).",51,mtms2011-03-414a,,
"eQUal prioritY For MUltiplication and division The matter of multiplication and division having equal priority is problematic for two reasons: 1.  Rocky the Squirrel stories do not naturally lend themselves to arithmetic expressions like 12 ÷ 2 × 3. (For example, “Rocky placed 12 acorns into 2 equal piles and then tripled each pile. How many acorns are in each pile?” is awkward.)  2.  The proper thing to do appears to  be left-to-right processing. ",52,mtms2011-03-414a,,
"Rather than employing lessthan-desirable Rocky stories, I change division notation to fraction notation in a multiplication or division expression and discuss various ways of processing the transformed expression. For example, the expression  30 ÷ 2 × 15 ÷ 3 × 4 becomes  30 15 × .",53,mtms2011-03-414a,,
"When the expression is written using fraction notation, the preservice teachers more readily conclude that multiplication and division have equal priority. However, for this approach to make sense, they must understand fraction multiplication.",54,mtms2011-03-414a,,
topping the hierarchY-oFoperators triangle,55,mtms2011-03-414a,,
"At this point, many preservice teachers wonder why the top of the hierarchy-of-operators triangle is vacant. Their PEDMAS background propels them to think that brackets belong there, but I discourage this thinking by asking two questions:  1.  What is in the triangle so far? 2.  Are brackets arithmetic operations? ",56,mtms2011-03-414a,,
We then discuss brackets as being containers rather than as indicators of processing order. We obtain values for expressions such as  2 × (3 + 4 × 5) + 1 + 8 + 6 × 2  in a variety of ways (sometimes leaving the bracket processing for last) to help establish that understanding.,57,mtms2011-03-414a,,
I use this story to complete the  hierarchy-of-operators triangle: ,58,mtms2011-03-414a,,
"Rocky decided that it was time to move to new quarters, but the current state of his home would not fetch many acorns on the real estate market. Some home improvements were needed. The front walk was a good place to begin. Rocky wanted to make a new walkway consisting of 3 large squares, with each square being 4 paving stones across. How many paving stones will Rocky need to buy for his new walk?",59,mtms2011-03-414a,,
"I ask the preservice teachers to represent the story with an arithmetic expression. Various ideas involving addition and multiplication are provided (e.g., 3 × 4 × 4; 16 + 16 + 16). I place a restriction on the expression; it must involve a power. After discussion, we agree on the expression 3 × 42. ",60,mtms2011-03-414a,,

"An advantage of developing the  hierarchy-of-operators triangle is that students can understand— 1.  why the order of operations is  valid, 2.  under what conditions one needs  to apply the hierarchy, 3.  that left-to-right processing is not  a mathematical truth, 4.  the various ways to process that are  possible, and  5.  that decision making is required  when determining processing order. ",64,mtms2011-03-414a,,
"In short, developing the hierarchy- of-operators triangle and its application encourages conceptual thinking and understanding. It also has a potentially significant payoff when learning algebra. This is not the case when PEDMAS (or its variants) is taught to students simply as a rule  to follow.",65,mtms2011-03-414a,,
