Molisani aAssessment, a hot topic for today’s  educators, has become synonymous with high-stakes testing. These assessments are complex and have multiple stakeholders, including students, parents, teachers, and administrators. Given the pressure of largescale evaluations, it is easy to forget that teacher-driven assessments can provide important information to encourage, enrich, or expand student learning. Multiple methods can evaluate student progress toward goals. Performance tasks or assessments are one way to understand what students can do mathematically when presented with new situations. ",4,Driving Students to Performance Assessments: Learning What Students Can Do
5,Driving Students to Performance Assessments: Learning What Students Can Do,"Determining what students know and can do is a vital part of effective classroom practices and an essential component of learning (Buhagiar 2007). Assessments give teachers information about student knowledge and ability, about the success of classroom practices, and identify areas in need of support. Two familiar forms of assessments are formative and summative. Formative assessments measure  progress toward goals while learning is in process. These regular checks of learning tell both student and teacher which concepts or skills are known and what needs work (Guskey 2007). Summative assessments measure student progress toward goals when instruction has been completed. An alternative assessment paradigm integrates teaching, learning, and assessment with teacher and student as colearners (Buhagiar 2007). The performance task, or performance assessment, described in this article was created with this paradigm in mind. ",5,Driving Students to Performance Assessments: Learning What Students Can Do
6,Driving Students to Performance Assessments: Learning What Students Can Do,Good assessment is complex and begins before the fi rst class is taught. Assessment comprises— •  goals for student learning and ability; •  activities that move students  toward goals; •  methods to measure student progress; •  a procedure to inform both the  student and the teacher about that measure; and •  a response to the assessment outcomes.

8,Driving Students to Performance Assessments: Learning What Students Can Do,"National and state standards  provide math teachers with learning goals, but they are less clear about how to measure student knowledge. Too often, assessments that are used to measure student knowledge about a concept measure other student abilities. For example, a student may possess conceptual understanding of a topic but do poorly on an assessment because of low computational fluency. Feedback from these kinds of assessments “communicate [to the student] what kind of mathematical knowledge and performance are valued” (Bahr 2007, p. 33), but that message may be counter to what is intended. Without a clear picture of student ability, teachers lack adequate information to meet the needs of students. Without a clear picture of their own ability, students may retain misconceptions and have little understanding about how to apply math in their day-today lives. Students may even start to believe that they are incapable of doing math.",8,Driving Students to Performance Assessments: Learning What Students Can Do

10,Driving Students to Performance Assessments: Learning What Students Can Do,assessing PerforMance The ability to apply conceptual ideas to new problems is a goal for learning. This goal includes understanding what knowledge and which procedures can be justified or used efficiently. Artists do this when they attempt to create a piece in a certain style. Musicians do this when they translate a new musical composition from paper to performance.,10,Driving Students to Performance Assessments: Learning What Students Can Do
11,Driving Students to Performance Assessments: Learning What Students Can Do,"Students need to test what they think they know about mathematics by attempting to use mathematical  concepts to solve new problems. In this way, students perform mathematically with the knowledge and skills they have acquired. The more students practice with mathematical ideas, the more competent and confident they become. Assessments built around applying knowledge represent challenges that students will face in all content areas as they move into independent and productive lives. ",11,Driving Students to Performance Assessments: Learning What Students Can Do
12,Driving Students to Performance Assessments: Learning What Students Can Do,"Performance assessments are tasks carefully designed to test the application of specific knowledge and skills. They are self-differentiating but respectful, meaning that each student is expected to understand and apply critical concepts incorporated into the task. How each student accomplishes this, what kind of product or solution they produce, and the dialogue and support provided along the way may vary. Fenwick (2012) felt that “central to performance assessment is the concept that educators support all students, regardless of their backgrounds, to achieve at the highest level of a learning domain” (p. 631). Each learner is responsible for the construction of his or her own knowledge through engagement with the content. The teacher and class are responsible for creating an environment conducive to risk taking and co-construction of knowledge. ",12,Driving Students to Performance Assessments: Learning What Students Can Do
13,Driving Students to Performance Assessments: Learning What Students Can Do,"As a task progresses, learning continues as students identify what they know and do not know. Formative assessments and observations of students at work identify areas of need, whereas imbedded instruction and problem-solving dialogue encourage understanding. Rubrics, focusing on key elements of the task, give students information about the characteristics of an exemplar solution before the task begins. A rubric also allows students to self-assess and “reflect on the quality of their work” (Andrade 2007, p. 60). Teachers facilitate the development of ideas and help identify and resolve misconceptions. Success is  not measured in relation to others but how well each student can use what he or she knows.

Students could be encouraged to explain why their method of consolidation resulted in a ratio similar to or different from that given and whether they felt their method of consolidation was still valid. A student who used the ratio imprinted on the car to estimate or check measurements of their toy car would be exhibiting a strong understanding of ratios. When students work backward from the solution to obtain the toy car measurements, these numbers would still need to be documented and compared with actual measurements.

Students were assured that all parts of the cars were created using the same scale. These discrepancies provided an opportunity for rich mathematical discussions about rounding, tolerances, and human error. It was interesting to note that students used a variety of methods to reconcile the differences in their ratios. Discussions were not centered on one method for resolving the differences, but on helping students choose a method they could justify.",52,Driving Students to Performance Assessments: Learning What Students Can Do
53,Driving Students to Performance Assessments: Learning What Students Can Do,"Four methods were used by students to consolidate unit ratios that were not equivalent into one overall ratio.

This method allowed discussion about the nonunit values in the ratios representing how many of a specific model car part would be equivalent to the same part on a real car. It also involved discussion about ratios with decimal parts. Students using this method were encouraged to round their ratios. In this case, a student might round to 1:59 or 1:60. The difference between 1:59 or 1:60 represented one model car length when measuring the actual car length, or it represented one model car width when measuring the actual car width.

This method is based on the idea of constraints, which are the largest and smallest values considered as possible solutions. For 1:55, 1:60, 1:52, and 1:68, the largest nonunit portion is in the ratio 1:68. There is an inverse relationship between the size of the nonunit portion of the ratio and the size of the model car. The smaller the model compared with the actual car, the larger the nonunit portion of the ratio. Students who chose this method  assumed that they had made errors of overestimating measurements and that their actual car was smaller than the other ratios suggested. Students ran the risk of their model garage or road being too small when they used this method. The inverse relationship between the size of the model car and the nonunit value of the ratio was very difficult for students to understand without actually measuring a distance with their model car and then measuring the same distance with something like a paperclip, which was smaller than their car.

Given the same ratios as above, the chosen ratio would be 1:52. These students assumed that they had underestimated when measuring and that their model car was larger than the other ratios indicated. It would take fewer model car lengths, given the ratio 1:52, to make up the actual car length than for the ratio 1:68. Students who chose this method decided that they were more willing to have their model garage or road be a little too large than too small. Like the previous method, few students chose this method.

Students used rulers to determine the length of a stationary object and to create a design with specific dimensional measures. It became clear which students continued to struggle with these skills. Because students could not move forward without being able to measure, they were receptive and eager to learn to use their rulers more effectively. The teacher, or another more able student, would explain or model the use of a ruler and remain until the student was comfortable with his or her ability.

In this situation, the use of focusing questions was invaluable. Such questions, as described by Wood (1998), involve the teacher listening to the student and then responding in ways that focus attention and thinking on a particular aspect of the problem. The questions encouraged students to use the idea of equivalent fractions to understand and verbalize the meaning of each value in the ratio. After that, students were to calculate the missing values in proportions, either through equivalent fractions or algebraically.

If the scale had been erroneously applied, the garage or road would be too large or too small. Errors of this nature were caught, examined, and discussed before final products were constructed. All students were successful in creating a product that matched the scale of their cars.",91,Driving Students to Performance Assessments: Learning What Students Can Do

These include the final design or model; a description of how the student had accomplished the task; measurements and calculations; and a reflection on what the student felt they understood about scale, ratio, and proportion. Student input on the rubric, completed  separately, was another. We were prepared to negotiate rubric scores with students but found surprisingly few differences between their completed rubrics and ours. Designs were displayed in the hallway to share with the school community. ",93,Driving Students to Performance Assessments: Learning What Students Can Do
94,Driving Students to Performance Assessments: Learning What Students Can Do,"Five class days were used to complete the entire assessment, including the three preliminary activities, with some of the work completed at home. At the end of the assessment, all students had made satisfactory progress toward the learning goals of determining the scale of a model compared with an actual object and applying that scale to create something proportional to the model. In addition, students had engaged in making sense of problems and persevering in solving them; reasoning, rationalizing, and critiquing the rationale of others; modeling; using appropriate tools; and attending to precision.

The use of checkpoints throughout the activity allowed for integrated learning, teaching, and assessment and turned the fear of failure into an opportunity for learning. Students engaged the content at an individual level, but were able to use the progress of their peers as springboards for creative and supportive dialogue.  reflecting on the ProJect Teachers were initially surprised at the lack of understanding that students brought to the task, given the results on the earlier written assessments on ratio and proportion. They were pleased with student progress as the performance assessment unfolded and impressed with the evidence that students provided of their knowledge.",99,Driving Students to Performance Assessments: Learning What Students Can Do
100,Driving Students to Performance Assessments: Learning What Students Can Do,"There are a few ways that this performance assessment could be improved. Having at least one actual car for students to measure and compare with a model would have greatly increased the real-life connection. Providing different measuring tools for students to use, such as Vernier calipers and micrometers, would have increased accuracy and broadened students’ knowledge of measurement. Because of the small size of the toy cars, measuring accurately with a ruler beyond 1/16 was difficult. This tolerance issue resulted in slightly inaccurate ratios but provided opportunities to discuss the concept of error.  aPPreciating Math",100,Driving Students to Performance Assessments: Learning What Students Can Do
101,Driving Students to Performance Assessments: Learning What Students Can Do,"At the conclusion of this task, students were not experts in proportional reasoning and scale, but they had moved toward a deeper understanding of the concept. Students learned to appreciate how the math they were learning could be applied in a realworld context. They experienced a genuine feeling of success and accomplishment as the finished products were displayed. The teachers learned  about student conceptualization of proportional reasoning and different ways to view math success. They were encouraged by the investment that the students made in their own learning. We think we understand, but it is the application of knowledge to new problems that reveals what we really know and can do. Single assessments may not be enough to determine student ability or to elicit students’ self-awareness of their capabilities. Integrating learning, teaching, and assessment creates a more equitable learning environment that sends a new message to students about the definition of success and the kinds of knowledge and abilities that are valued.
