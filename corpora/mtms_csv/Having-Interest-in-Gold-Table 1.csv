3,Having Interest in Gold,"HAVING INTEREST IN GOLD 1.  Hagar is borrowing 10,000 gold coins from a bank. Suppose he pays back the loan with equal monthly payments for 4 years. The bank does not charge any interest on the loan. (Interest is a fee a lender charges a customer for borrowing money.) What is his monthly payment in gold coins? Round to the nearest gold coin.",3,Having Interest in Gold
4,Having Interest in Gold,"  b.  Hagar pays back the 10,000  gold coins in 50 equal payments. How much does he pay the bank each month in principal and interest? c.  What is the total amount that Hagar pays the bank over the 50 months? 4. Suppose Hagar borrows 10,000 gold coins for 3 years at 5% per year. Separately, Hagar loans the loan offi cer 2,000 coins for 3 years. What yearly interest rate should Hagar charge the loan offi cer to cover the full cost of his interest payments to the bank on the 10,000 gold coins?  2. Suppose the bank charges Hagar  360 gold coins in interest each year for a 50-month loan on the 10,000 gold coins.    a.  How much does Hagar pay  in interest each month? How much does he pay in interest over 50 months?   d.  Do you think that Hagar’s loan  offi cer should charge him interest on the loan? Explain.",4,Having Interest in Gold
5,Having Interest in Gold,"3. Suppose the bank charges Hagar  3% interest per year on the 10,000 gold coins over the 50-month loan. How many gold coins would Hagar pay in interest over the 50 months? 5. Hagar has 19 gold coins. Some are $50 coins, and the rest are $100 coins. The total face value of the coins is $1,650. How many coins of each type does he have? from the October 2017 issue of",5,Having Interest in Gold

7,Having Interest in Gold,"SOLUTIONS 1. Hagar would pay 10,000 ÷ 48 ≈ 208.33, or about 208 gold coins per month. He would need to pay another 16 coins at the end of the term to complete payment.",7,Having Interest in Gold
8,Having Interest in Gold,"2. Sample answer: a. 30 gold coins; 1,500 gold coins. 360 ÷ 12 = 30, so Hagar pays 30 gold coins in interest each month. Since 50 × 30 = 1,500, Hagar pays a total of 1,500 gold coins in interest over the 50 months.",8,Having Interest in Gold
9,Having Interest in Gold,"b.  230 gold coins; 10,000 ÷ 50 = 200, so Hagar pays 200 gold coins each month toward the principal. He also pays 30 gold coins each month in interest, so he pays 200 + 30, or 230 gold coins to the bank each month.",9,Having Interest in Gold
10,Having Interest in Gold,"c.  11,500 gold coins. Hagar pays the bank the 10,000 gold coins he borrowed, plus 1,500 gold coins in interest over the life of the loan.",10,Having Interest in Gold
11,Having Interest in Gold,"d.  Sample answer: Hagar’s loan officer should charge interest on the loan because Hagar now has the use of the money that belonged to the bank. Banks, like other businesses, need to make money to stay in business.",11,Having Interest in Gold
12,Having Interest in Gold,One way they make money is to charge more interest on loans than they pay on depositors’ accounts.,12,Having Interest in Gold
13,Having Interest in Gold,"3. 1,250 gold coins. 0.03 × 10,000 = 300, so Hagar pays 300 gold coins in interest per year. In 4 years (48 months), Hagar pays 4 × 300, or 1,200 gold coins. The remaining 2 months represent 2/12, or 1/6 year, so Hagar pays 1/6 × 300, or 50 gold coins for the remaining 2 months. Thus, Hagar would pay a total of 1,200 + 50, or 1,250 gold coins in interest over the 50 months.  You may need to provide support to students when they are figuring out what to do with the extra 2 months after the first 4 years (48 months) are over.  4. 25%. This question is assuming simple interest. Sample solution: At 5% interest per year for 3 years,",13,Having Interest in Gold
14,Having Interest in Gold,"Hagar will pay the bank 0.05 × 10,000 × 3, or 1,500 gold coins in interest over the 3 years. This means Hagar must charge the loan officer 1,500 gold coins in interest on the loan of 2,000 gold coins over the 3 years. As such, Hagar must charge the loan officer 500 gold coins per year in interest. Because 500 ÷ 2,000 = 0.25, Hagar must charge the loan officer interest at the rate of 25% per year.  5. 5 $50 coins and 14 $100 coins.",14,Having Interest in Gold
15,Having Interest in Gold,Sample solution: Let x = the number of $50 coins he has. Then 19 – x represents the number of $100 coins he has. Solve the following equation showing the total value of each type of coins on the left side and the total value of the coins on the right side: 50x + 100(19 – x) = 1650 50x + 1900 – 100x = 1650 –50x = –250 x = 5,15,Having Interest in Gold
16,Having Interest in Gold,"So, there are 5 $50 coins and 19 – 5, or 14, $100 coins.",16,Having Interest in Gold
17,Having Interest in Gold,FIELD-TEST COMMENTS,17,Having Interest in Gold
18,Having Interest in Gold,"My sixth-grade prealgebra students were familiar with car payments and mortgages prior to reading about Hagar the Horrible’s situation. Understanding that the bank needs to make a profit on the service provided, they did not feel the interest rate was unreasonable. Exploring solution strategies for problems 4 and 5 provided an opportunity for a mathematical discussion. Calculating Hagar’s number of coins in interest was easily achieved by multiplying the principal × rate × time. The loan officer rate was calculated by one student who noticed that 2,000 is one fifth of 10,000, so five times the rate is 25 percent. Hagar became a loan shark charging 25 percent!",18,Having Interest in Gold
19,Having Interest in Gold,"The final question’s solution was  modeled with systems and tables. Students made a table with $50 coins, $100 coins, and the total value. They listed the number of each coin to total 19 and calculated the value. Realizing that they had to have an odd number of $50 coins, many began with 1 and 18 to arrive at $1,850. Then they continued  with 3 and 16, and finally 5 and 14. Other students set up a system with 50x + 10y = 1,650 and x + y = 19. Solving for y, they multiplied the second equation by 50 with the result of y = 14. Sharing strategies, students looked at this problem from various perspectives. Having multiple strategies in their mathematical toolbox builds confidence! ",19,Having Interest in Gold

23,Having Interest in Gold,"I did this activity with my two accelerated classes. In general, these students complete the last half of seventh-grade math and all of eighth-grade math in their seventhgrade year. We had already covered the concepts of interest, percentages, and proportional reasoning and were working on systems of equations. I used this as a Friday activity to give the students a break from the normal hustle and bustle of every day. They really enjoyed it.

Students worked as partners on each of the questions. While students were working, I walked around and took pictures of different strategies to solving the problems. Then we analyzed the strategies and made connections between them. ",24,Having Interest in Gold
25,Having Interest in Gold,"We did not do problem 4 for the sake of time; however, students realized that they could write a system of equations for problem 5. It was challenging for them to write a system of equations for the problem because we had only worked with systems in the form of y = mx + b. For problem 5, the equations were in standard form Ax + By = C. Most students made a table to solve the problem, so I challenged them to write an equation and solve. They experimented with strategies and properties to rearrange terms. It ",25,Having Interest in Gold

This math problem, completed by Abraham Lincoln, was discovered in some of his old papers. (https://www.illustrative mathematics.org/content-standards/tasks/1550) was good to gauge where they were in terms of writing an equation to represent a word problem. Many did not know how to solve it because we had only worked on setting equations equal to each other, making  tables, and graphing to solve systems. I gained insight into how to approach solving systems in standard form.",28,Having Interest in Gold
