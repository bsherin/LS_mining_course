Twice a month, they deposited their net pay and pay bills ranging from rent and electricity to student loans and car insurance. This lesson was a natural fit! Taxing problems provided them with a new perspective on why their net pay was so much less than their gross amount. Interesting discussions occurred about whether it was better to receive a huge refund or owe money at the end of the tax year. Students were surprised that a refund meant that the government had some of their money for the year and they were not earning any interest on that “investment.”",11,Taxing Problems
