"Mathematics l. lynn stallings, lstalling@kennesaw.edu, teaches in the Department of Secondary and Middle Grades Education at Kennesaw State University, Kennesaw, GA 30144. Interests include dispositions related to effective teaching and the use of technology.",1,mtms2007-11-212a,,
"sSporting News, a popular sports  magazine, runs certain stories under the heading of  “See a different game.” These stories are in-depth analyses of strategy. The slogan means that if you know more about the strategy of the game, you will see the game differently.",2,mtms2007-11-212a,,
"If students are pushed to think  about mathematics more deeply and flexibly, they will, in effect, “see a different mathematics.” We can change our game plans by strategically posing mathematics problems so that students get that chance. As we add to our playbook of problem-posing strategies, our students will come to “understand a different mathematics.”",3,mtms2007-11-212a,,
"The problem-posing strategies suggested here should result in problems that raise the level of cognitive demand for your students. What most determines what students learn is the “level and kind of thinking in which students engage” (Stein, Smith, Henningsen, and Silver 2000, p. 11). In solving these problems, students see that mathematics is not a series of disconnected routines to be memorized but that it involves connected ideas that can be used to solve all sorts of problems.",4,mtms2007-11-212a,,
"The “different mathematics” that we want for all students is described in the Learning Principle of Principles and Standards for School Mathematics: “When challenged with appropriately chosen tasks, students become confident in their ability to tackle difficult problems, eager to figure things out on their own, flexible in exploring mathematical ideas and trying alternative solution paths, and willing to persevere” (NCTM 2000, p. 20). Posing problems in different ways also integrates the Process Standards into our classrooms, especially the Problem Solving Standard (NCTM 2000). Problem solving is defined as “engaging in a task for which the solution method is not known in advance” (p. 52). No matter which mathematics problem is being solved, the Communication Standard is essential because  students need to explain their thinking about mathematics. Students must show how they solved any problem and why they know their answer is correct. The word show is chosen deliberately, with the intention of inviting more than just verbal explanations. Asking students to “Show how you know . . .” is a great discussion starter after any problem has been solved.",5,mtms2007-11-212a,,
"Students cannot “show how they  know” without using the Reasoning and Proof, Representation, and Connections Standards (NCTM 2000). Consider having students use a think-pair-share process in which they first work individually to articulate and represent their own ideas; pair up to show and explain their ideas to a colleague; and, finally, discuss and compare various solutions in a whole-class discussion. All five NCTM Process Standards will be illustrated in that class session.",6,mtms2007-11-212a,,
"Creative problem posing is also enjoyable and rejuvenating for us. Posing nontypical problems provides an opportunity for the teacher to be creative in emphasizing connections between mathematics topics and developing students’ mathematical dispositions. Students see so many typical problems that they begin trying to solve them without thinking, yet a lack of thinking is exactly what we would like students to avoid. Instead, they need to experience problem solving in which they think and stretch themselves mathematically. Let’s look at some typical problems that students might encounter in middle school mathematics and how we might transform them. To show that these strategies for posing problems can be applied to most topics, we will use the same common examples to illustrate each of the these strategies: (1) finding the greatest common factor (GCF), (2) area, (3) perimeter, and (4) the equation of a line.

Jeopardy probleMs,8,mtms2007-11-212a,,
"To mirror the television game show Jeopardy, where contestants are given  answers and told to reply with questions, we can give solutions to our students and ask for questions that result in those answers. For example, “Two numbers with a common factor of 2” might result in the student reply of “What are 4 and 8?” or “What are any two even numbers?” Provide what would typically be the answer, and ask for what might more typically be given as the problem. These types of problems will challenge your students, not because the problems are especially hard but because students do not usually think about constructing problems. Constructing the problem from the answer requires a deeper mathematical understanding and a different mindset than they are used to.",9,mtms2007-11-212a,,

"Present a problem with more than one answer or no answers. Get students out of the habit of assuming that every mathematics problem has only one answer.

Students are so accustomed to finding the one answer that you will need to help them develop this mathematical disposition to always check the reasonableness of their answers and to ensure that more answers are not possible.
