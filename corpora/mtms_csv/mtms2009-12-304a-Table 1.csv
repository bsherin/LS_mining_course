"Mr. and Mrs. Ortenzi want to have three children. They have picked out three names for a boy and three names for a girl. Since Mrs. Ortenzi wants to have three girls, she would like to learn about the chance that this might occur. To help her determine her chance of having three girls, solve the problems below. ",3,mtms2009-12-304a,,
"PRoBleMs 1.  Suppose Mrs. Ortenzi has only two children. If she has girls, the first will be named April and the second will be Chonda. If she has boys, the first will be Billy and the second will be Dylan. Make a list of the ways that her two children can be named, considering all combinations of boys and girls.",4,mtms2009-12-304a,,
"2.  From your list, in how many ways  is it mathematically possible for Mrs. Ortenzi to have two children? How many of these combinations have two girls? What is the theoretical probability of having two girls? ",5,mtms2009-12-304a,,
"This department highlights math concepts in the context of problem solving in the real world. Readers are encouraged to submit ideas or work with someone they know to create a manuscript.

He is currently teaching at Indiana University in Indianapolis.",6,mtms2009-12-304a,,
"3.  Mrs. Ortenzi does not trust the  listing method. Instead, she looks at the genders of twins over the last year at her local hospital. She notices that of 125 sets of twins, 32 were boys only and 63 were one girl and one boy. Using these data, what is the experimental probability of having twins that are two girls?  4. Mrs. Ortenzi decides to flip a coin  to simulate the births of triplets. She flips three coins and records each head as a girl and each tail as a boy. She runs this experiment ten times. Run the same experiment as Mrs. Ortenzi. Count the number of times you get three girls. Determine the experimental probability of having three girls.",7,mtms2009-12-304a,,
"5.  How could Mrs. Ortenzi increase  the accuracy of her experiment? 6.  Suppose Mrs. Ortenzi has three children. If she has girls, she will name them April, Chonda, and Emma—in that order. If she has boys, she will name them Billy, Dylan, and Fred—in that order. Make a list of the ways that her three children can be named. Use your list to calculate the theoretical probability of Mrs. Ortenzi having three girls. How does this compare with your experimental probability?",8,mtms2009-12-304a,,
"The solutions are appended to the online version of “Math for Real” at  www.nctm.org/mtms.  solutions to math for real (Continued from page 304) 1.   Two girls = AC, two boys = BD,  one of each = AB or BA 2.  Four ways; 1 combination with two girls; the probability of having two girls is 1/4 3.  30 sets, 30/125 ≈ .24, or 24%.  This is an ideal time to discuss with students the difference between theoretical and experimental probability.",9,mtms2009-12-304a,,

"It may help students to note that this notation is actually adding a new option to the possibilities from question 1. Of the eight possible ways, only one will result in the three names of the girls being used; 1/8 = .125 = 12.5%.",13,mtms2009-12-304a,,
"On a Texas Instruments graphing calculator, students can use the Prob Sim function. Use the coin toss application to simulate as many births as you want to investigate.",14,mtms2009-12-304a,,
"Another possibility is to use the  random integer function on the calculator: RandInt(0,1,3). This will give three sets of the numbers 0 or 1. Let 0 = girl, and 1 = boy. You can quickly run as many trials as you wish, counting the number of times that three girls appear and the total number of trials.",15,mtms2009-12-304a,,
