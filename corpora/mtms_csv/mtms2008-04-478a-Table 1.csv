"Nathan Armer, Savanna Green,   and Jessica Schneider aAn important goal of school mathematics involves helping students use the powerful forms of representation that have been developed over the centuries through the work of mathematicians throughout the world. However, challenges exist in encouraging students to develop meaning for the mathematical symbols used in formal algebra. Research has demonstrated that students often fail to develop a deep understanding of the meaning of symbolic representations of variables (e.g., Booth 1984; Clement 1982), so much so that Thompson (1994) found that a limited understanding of the meaning of variables negatively impacts students who later take college calculus. The question arises as to how we can develop meaning for formal algebraic symbols in the middle grades so that instruction can build on this meaning throughout students’ high school and college experiences.

"According to NCTM (2000),  representation refers both to process and to product—in other words, to the act of capturing a mathematical concept or relationship in some form and to the form itself. . . . Moreover, the term applies to the processes and products that are observable externally as well as to those that occur “internally,” in the minds of people doing mathematics.

"This definition describes the intertwined nature of a representation as a physical and mental construct—one that is not separate from the view of the representation held in the mind of the individual viewing it. Such a definition points to the difficulty of assessing student thinking when we examine an external representation, such as a student’s written formula, but are unsure how the student views the representations that he or she writes. For example, do students view the expression 4n + 5 (for all n in the ",7,mtms2008-04-478a,,

"Current research on student use of  representations shows that students move from informal, individually meaningful representations toward the use of formal, traditional representations through a gradual process. Smith (2003) notes that students initially “create idiosyncratic representations, draw on conventional representations, and blend idiosyncratic and conventional representations as they solve contextualized problems” (p. 263). Students build meaning for representations by using them in various ways. These ways include talking with other students about various representations and writing explanations about one’s thinking. In both, using a representation should be viewed as a powerful way to communicate one’s ideas with others. ",12,mtms2008-04-478a,,
"The following paragraphs describe  how four fifth-grade students attributed meaning to the informal and  formal algebraic representations they used, moving from verbal representations, to syncopated expressions (Swafford and Langrall 2000), to the use of formal symbols. We worked with these students in eighteen sessions over four months. Initially, they had no experience with formal algebraic symbols. The meaning of formal symbols developed over time as students generalized various situations using computer spreadsheet software.",13,mtms2008-04-478a,,

"Angie quickly recognized that she should multiply the number of posters by 3 to determine the number of tacks required to solve the Poster problem, but she struggled to determine how multiplying by 3 connected to the number of posters. For four posters, she multiplied 5 by 3, arriving at 15 tacks. When asked how many tacks were necessary for five posters, she applied recursive reasoning, adding 3 to the 15 tacks required for four posters. When we asked Angie to determine another method for finding the number of tacks, she returned to counting the number of groups of 3 tacks in the picture, multiplying 6 by 3 as she observed that  there were 6 groups of 3 tacks. Angie described how to determine the number of tacks when given the number of posters, stating that she could take “three times the number of posters, plus 3.” She explained that she recognized that there were 3 tacks on the left side of each poster and an additional 3 tacks on the right side of the last poster. When explaining her rule, Angie clearly communicated a general relationship that connected her verbal rule and the pictorial representation of the situation.",21,mtms2008-04-478a,,

"All students used either verbal rules or syncopated expressions to describe their initial generalizations. During session 9, students were introduced to formal algebraic symbolism through the use of a fictitious student. We demonstrated how a student wrote an expression such as 5 • n + 3 to represent “5 times a number and adding 3” and noted that this was the way that students often wrote general statements in high school algebra classes.",31,mtms2008-04-478a,,
"From this point, students applied formal and informal representations to represent varying quantities. It was difficult for some students to delineate varying quantities and fixed quantities in their generalizations. For example, in session 13, Lloyd wrote the formula  #= for the situation in which he was asked to determine the number of slices that each person would receive if 72 slices of pizza were shared equally among any number of friends. Lloyd described his rule as “Any number divided by any number is any number.” After some discussion with another student regarding the fact that the number of slices of pizza was a known quantity, ",32,mtms2008-04-478a,,

"Lloyd did not replace the # symbol with 72, stating that it could be “any number.” Later, Lloyd noted that the first number represented the number of slices of pizza. From an outsider’s perspective, it appeared that Lloyd used a rule with no invariant conditions. However, on the basis of our discussion, it was clear that Lloyd recognized that the number of slices of pizza was invariant for this problem situation.",37,mtms2008-04-478a,,
"In session 14, Dallas grappled with how to use variable notation to match his verbal rule for the Border problem (see fig. 5). Dallas built on his understanding of area, determining the total number of squares, both dotted and not dotted. He then subtracted the number of squares that were not dotted from the total number of squares to determine the number of squares in the border. For example, he recognized that a 7 × 7 design contained 49 total squares (because of the 7 × 7 array) and that 25 squares (a 5 × 5 array) were in the inner portion of the figure. He calculated the total for the squares by subtracting the number of inner squares (25) from the total number of squares (49).",38,mtms2008-04-478a,,
"When asked to write his new  rule, Dallas initially wrote a rule that contained a combination of formal and informal symbols (see fig. 6). When he described this rule, it became clear that ",39,mtms2008-04-478a,,
Fig. 6 Dallas’s initial symbolic representation for the Border problem,40,mtms2008-04-478a,,
"Dallas viewed the # symbols and N as being the same quantity. We suggested that Dallas write his rule as if entering the calculations in a single cell in his spreadsheet. In the past, we engaged students in discussions about writing formulas in single cells instead of breaking the calculations into separate chunks, as students are forced to do when using a calculator. This led them to consider how to combine their operations into a single expression. After this suggestion, Dallas stated that he would first start with a “square number,” such as 5 × 5, 4 × 4, and so on. He represented this relationship as N × E. When asked whether the quantities were the same or different, he stated they were the same and adjusted his expression to N × N. After further deliberation, Dallas wrote his rule as N × N – (N – 2) × N. As he explained his rule in relation to the 7 × 7 grid, he noticed that the (7 – 2) × 7 portion  of his rule should result in the expression 5 × 5 rather than 5 × 7. He then adjusted his rule so that the final part of his expression read N × N – (N – 2) × (N – 2) (see fig. 7). ",41,mtms2008-04-478a,,
"In this example, Dallas was able to identify the independent variable, the length of the border design, and write a formal algebraic expression to match his verbal rule. However, he struggled with the repeated use of the independent variable in the situation. After being questioned about the meaning attached to each of the quantities, he was able to construct such a rule. However, throughout our work with students, we found that although all students were able to write and interpret symbolic representations, they were more successful when verbally describing their general rules than formally representing them with algebraic notation.  dEVELoPiNG MEANiNG For SyMBoLic rEPrESENTATioNS In the following paragraphs, we further discuss how students develop meaning for symbolic representations and provide strategies to deepen student understanding of the meaning of formal algebraic symbols. ",42,mtms2008-04-478a,,
"Giving students opportunities to construct their own representations, discuss the meaning of these representations, and debate the advantages and limitations of each are important elements in the process of developing and refining algebraic representations. ",43,mtms2008-04-478a,,
"Once a student develops a general rule, focusing discussion on the meaning and usefulness of this representation has many benefits. First, discussion can help the student who created the representation to better understand the general nature and meaning of the representation. This strategy allows other students to consider representations that they might not have independently developed. The teacher can encourage students to consider the advantages and disadvantages of various representations. For example, a verbal representation is closely connected to the meaning of the situation, and the variables are clearly defined. However, a verbal representation is not as efficient as the symbolic representations that are used in formal algebra. Formal symbols are powerful shorthand but can often be confusing because of the lack of meaning that students associate with these symbols. ",44,mtms2008-04-478a,,
"In addition, through discussion,  students can link verbal and symbolic representations. We encourage teachers to help students transition to the use of symbolic representations by beginning with students’ natural ways of representing generalizations, moving to the use of a combination of verbal and symbolic representations, and concluding with the use of formal symbolic representations. By providing problems that can be solved with both informal and symbolic representations, students are encouraged to make connections between these two types of representa-",45,mtms2008-04-478a,,
"Fig. 7 Dallas’s revised symbolic representation for the Border problem tions. These problems can also help students make the transition to the use of formal symbols. For example, the teacher can have students write a verbal description such as “multiply the number of posters by 3 and add 3 more tacks” and a formal algebraic representation of the same rule N × 3 + 3 or  3N + 3 so that students demonstrate the connection that they have made between these two types of representations. Encouraging students to write these two types can also better allow the teacher to determine whether the student is having difficulty constructing a generalization or difficulty representing the generalization.",46,mtms2008-04-478a,,
"Another challenge in assessing student understanding of representations is that a student-developed algebraic representation has a degree of generality that is initially known only to the student who developed the representation. We applied two strategies to assess student views of the generality of their expressions: (a) we asked them to explain their general rule in relation to the context of the problem situation and (b) we questioned students regarding what values they deemed appropriate for their rules. For (a), we encouraged students to describe what variables represented and what various components of their generalizations represented (e.g., in the expression 3x + 2, what quantity does the expression 3x represent in relation to this problem?). Through asking such questions, a deeper view of the student’s understanding of the generality of her rule was revealed. In addition, after students verbalized and wrote their generalizations, we questioned them about the domain of the expressions, asking them questions about the values  that they deemed appropriate for their rules. This often led to lively discussions about whether zero, various fractions, or other numbers would generate appropriate values for the problem context. As students moved toward the use of symbolic representations, these discussions caused students to focus on the generality of the expressions they wrote.",47,mtms2008-04-478a,,
"Another consideration in helping students develop meaning for formal symbols is through the use of technology. Our students had access to computer spreadsheet technology. As students clicked on various cells to create their rules, they were able to construct symbolic expressions (e.g., 3 * A4 + 5) that closely mirrored the formal symbolic representations used in algebra. Initially, students tended to ignore the symbols that were generated in the cells on the spreadsheet. As the spreadsheet notation became more familiar to them, they recognized the connection between their verbal rules and the computer syntax. The computer software served as an initial translator of student informal representations into formal symbols. Students were later able to connect their verbal rules, the computer spreadsheet rules, and the formal algebraic symbols so that all these representations had similar meanings.",48,mtms2008-04-478a,,
coNcLuSioN,49,mtms2008-04-478a,,
Developing meaning for symbolic representations is an important part of the middle school mathematics experience for all students. We must not see simply writing symbolic representations as the end goal but focus on the internal meaning that students ascribe to these symbols. ,50,mtms2008-04-478a,,
"Too often, students lack a deep  understanding of the algebraic symbols that they write, failing to recognize the general nature of their representations. In our work, we began with representations that were introduced by students as they developed generalizations. Before introducing formal symbolic  representations, our students developed their own nonstandard means for representing algebraic situations. Through student-to-student and student-toteacher discourse, meaningful formal representations emerged. As meaning continued to develop, students focused on the generality of their representations. Through the development of meaning of formal representations, we can reduce the pitfalls associated with instruction that focuses on manipulating symbols without connection to the meaning behind these symbols.
