"When students are asked to write original story problems about fractional amounts, it can illustrate their misunderstandings about fractions. Think about the situations your students would describe to model 1/2 + 2/3.",1,mtms2010-08-27a,,
"Cathleen M. Alexander and Rebecca C. Ambrose oOne of the joys of our teaching careers has been the “Aha!” moments when  a student’s face lights up with a smile of understanding and fulfillment. We have also experienced the “Oh, no!” sentiments when, while reviewing student work, we realize that someone has not grasped a concept that we were sure had been understood by all. Many times, the topic of confusion involved fractions. Even when students had performed flawlessly on class work and homework assignments, their skill would suddenly disappear only to be replaced by a random method of problem solving when adding fractions with unlike denominators. “What happened?” we asked ourselves. The reality of the students’ lack of real understanding had surfaced.",2,mtms2010-08-27a,,

"Original student-authored story problems reveal a variety of misunderstandings that students hold about fractions. Three elements, in particular, challenge students:  1.  Which of three models (region, or area; measure; or set) is best suited for a particular situation; 2.  Unit consistency relating to the  choice of the whole; and  3.  Action portrayed in the story compared with the operation of the symbolic problem given. ",4,mtms2010-08-27a,,

"While looking for a way to better recognize student misconceptions, author Alexander began to question students individually about one of her favorite problems:",6,mtms2010-08-27a,,
"Reading Surely You’re Joking, Mr. Feynman! (Feynman 1985) inspired her original interest in the problem. Feynman describes a college admissions  office that had neglected to prescreen the math skills of their incoming freshman. Feynman solved this problem quickly. As the freshmen were lining up to register, he asked each one who approached his table just one question: “What is 1/2 + 2/3?” Those students who correctly gave the answer were sent to the math class of their choice. Those who made the common error of adding the numerators and denominators straight across as if they were integers, resulting in 3/5, were assigned to precollege math. Feynman seemed to be saying that this one fraction problem could reveal a student’s general understanding of mathematics and that many university freshmen still did not understand fractions. Alexander was curious to try something like this. ",7,mtms2010-08-27a,,
"Her assessment included the task of writing an original story problem for a given mathematical expression. As a teacher-researcher, Alexander asked students from various other classrooms to write their own story problem that demonstrated the sum of 1/2 + 2/3. The stories described here are from the first sixteen students to whom she gave this task, fifteen upper elementary and middle school  students and one high school student. Everyone sampled had received instruction in adding fractions. Asking students to write their own story problems highlighted particular understandings as well as misunderstandings regarding fractions. Since students made sensible mistakes (Peck and Jencks 1981), that is, their answers made sense to them, we thought we could learn a great deal about students’ fraction conceptions from reading their stories. We hoped to begin thinking about how to enhance fraction instruction so students would be more successful.  sWeet stoRY PRoBleMs",8,mtms2010-08-27a,,
"Alexander continued to collect story problems. She found that although most students could complete the task of writing a story, they had varying degrees of success. Of sixteen students who were sampled, three did not try to write a problem, indicating that it was too difficult. One of the three noted that he did not know how to deal with the fact that the result would be greater than 1. ",9,mtms2010-08-27a,,
Table 1 contains the problems  written by the other thirteen students. It is striking to see that the problems  table 1 students were asked to write story problems to represent the sum of 1/2 + 2/3. their work illustrated their different  understandings and misunderstandings about fraction addition. ,10,mtms2010-08-27a,,

After reading these stories, we got the impression that students think that fractions usually apply to dessert,  and that the fractional portions need to be eaten. ",24,mtms2010-08-27a,,
"Before asking students to write a story problem, Alexander presented the problem to them symbolically. Four of the sixteen students could successfully find a common denominator and generate the correct answer. Nine  students were unsuccessful at solving the problem and writing a story around it. Six students made the same mistake as Feynman’s university freshmen and answered 3/5. One such student, who wrote story K, started with 3/5 of a cookie. Since over half the students sampled were unsuccessful at both tasks,  we hoped that examining their story problems would give us some insight into their difficulties with fractions. ",25,mtms2010-08-27a,,
"Two of the students (authors of stories B and D), who successfully solved the symbol problem, could write a sensible story problem for the task. The other two students who successfully solved the symbol problem had some issues with their story problems. The author of story C knew that he had forgotten how to solve the symbol problem but was able to successfully write a story problem. We felt that this mismatch  between story-problem construction and symbol manipulation warranted further examination. In particular, we needed to pay closer attention to the stories that students wrote to assess the extent of their fraction understanding.",26,mtms2010-08-27a,,
"To judge if the overall story made  sense, we looked at both the individual parts and the story as a whole. Although most had a food context, differences occurred regarding the consistency of the units in the problem and the fraction models used. Students also differed in the actions that they incorporated into the problem. Other factors added complexity but not clarity to many stories, including its more-than-1-whole solution. ",27,mtms2010-08-27a,,
Model tYPe,28,mtms2010-08-27a,,
"According to van de Walle (2007), fractions are equal shares or equal- sized portions of a whole or unit and can be modeled in three ways: region, or area; measure; and set.",29,mtms2010-08-27a,,
"Area The region, or area, model is employed when a region is evenly shared or divided into a number of smaller parts or portions. The parts are named by comparing them with the whole. A common representation of this model is a circle divided into equal-sized sections.",30,mtms2010-08-27a,,
"Of the nine students who attempted to use the area model, three were successful. These three used circular food items and acknowledged that the answer would be greater than 1. Story A included two different pies. In story B, Nana explicitly started out with 2 cheesecakes, and story C implied 2 pizzas. The other stories included cookies, apple, and pies but did not include an appropriate action, a point we explore shortly.",31,mtms2010-08-27a,,
Measure,32,mtms2010-08-27a,,
"Only one student wrote a story using the measure model; it is also the only problem in the sample that did not involve food. Story D requires that the reader both solve the addition operation and decide if the answer exceeds 1 whole. This second part was not strictly necessary, as the question could have been: “How many pounds  of soil did they have altogether?” Unlike the successful area model stories in which 2 wholes were needed for reference (stories A and B), this model assumes a continuous quantity. Thus, it was unnecessary to alert the reader when the sum exceeded 1 pound. The measure model works well for this particular problem because having more that 1 whole is a real-life measurement situation. ",33,mtms2010-08-27a,,
"Set A few authors used wholes that were collections of items. Although only story H successfully used the set model, it was unclear if the batches of cookies in this story were the same size. The set model also made it difficult for the author to pose the question. Note that the collections tended to be groups of apples, but in one case the group was a batch of cookies. ",34,mtms2010-08-27a,,
"In some stories, as found in E, the number of apples in the collection was specified, in this case, 6, which was a strategic choice because 6 is the common denominator of the two fractions. In other cases, as in stories F and G, a number was not given. This model turned out to be challenging for students to use with this particular task because of unit consistency. ",35,mtms2010-08-27a,,
Unit consistencY,36,mtms2010-08-27a,,
"Most students who used the set models ran  into trouble with unit consistency. Successful stories tended to use the region or area model where “1 whole” was clearly defined, such as 1 whole cookie, 1 apple, or 1 pie. Six of the thirteen stories had consistent units. Although the units were clearly defined, none of the authors made it explicit that the 2 wholes in the problems were the same size.",37,mtms2010-08-27a,,
"This is similar to what occurred  with fourth graders who took the Sixth Mathematics Assessment of NAEP (Kouba, Zawojewski, and Strutchens 1997): They tended not to distinguish between halves that originated from different-sized wholes. When symbolically adding 1/2 and 2/3, students have to realize that the fractions refer to wholes of the same size, so it is not surprising that authors failed to specify samesized wholes. See, for example, story A: Tina’s and Jason’s pies were the same size. ",38,mtms2010-08-27a,,
"The authors of stories E, F, and ",39,mtms2010-08-27a,,
"G (which fall into the set-model category of stories), switched units in the middle of the problem. Each problem started with collections of apples. However, the final question in each problem asked for a certain number of apples rather than for a  fraction of the collection of apples. This was problematic, since the stories each began with the collection as the whole. ",40,mtms2010-08-27a,,
"L, Molly needed to share her half cookie with two friends. If Molly does not get a share herself, this situation would model  action",41,mtms2010-08-27a,,
"Even though addition is usually considered the most simple of the mathematical operations with fractions, the interpretation of addition in this context proved to be difficult for some students. In successful stories, the action combined two separate quantities united into one new quantity. For example, in story A, Tina and Jason combined their 2 pieces of pie, which could then be considered as 1 whole pie, with an additional 1/6 piece of the same-sized pie. ",42,mtms2010-08-27a,,
"Six of the stories did not use the action of combining. Stories G and J required the operation of multiplying 2/3 by 1/2, and story K implied division of 3/5 by 3. Four of the six nonaddition problems included sharing actions. In story I, the author wanted Jim to share evenly to prevent an argument, but he was unclear as to how many cookies Jim had to begin with or if Jim was going to share whole or half-sized cookies. In story J, the author indicated that you are giving parts of an apple to a friend. In story K, Kitty started with a fractional portion of a cookie and three friends to share with and needed to know if sharing was even possible. In story  which is a division problem. In story L, 1/2 referred to a cookie, and 2/3 referred to 2 out of 3 friends, suggesting that the author had difficulty interpreting the quantity 2/3. ",43,mtms2010-08-27a,,
"The author of story L, along with  the authors identified above, associated fractions with sharing. We hypothesize that this was the case because teachers and texts often appeal to students’ informal experiences, with sharing as a starting point in fraction instruction (Empson 2001; van de Walle 2007). These sharing stories made us suspect that these authors had not yet matured enough in their thinking to consider the result of sharing as a single quantity. In other words, these authors seemed to think about 2/3 in terms of 3 people sharing 2 wholes rather than as a quantity in and of itself. For these authors, sharing was a more prominent action than combining.",44,mtms2010-08-27a,,
"Eight out of thirteen stories  contained some mention of a givingaway action or a missing piece. Two authors of successful stories, stories B and C, described food that went away as it was eaten and/or then leftover. ",45,mtms2010-08-27a,,
"More often, these associations with taking away and leftovers were negative in that they confused the story or distorted the context. For example, in story M, the author confused the eaten pie with the leftover portion. If 2/3 were eaten, then only 1/3 was leftover to be added to the other 1/2 pie. This problem had other issues, including being unclear that the pies and the pieces were the same size. In story J, the only action was giving away; in story G, Gino gave some apples away by throwing some at Tony. ",46,mtms2010-08-27a,,
"Half the authors wrote a story  involving an appropriate combining action. They were able to connect the meaning of addition in whole numbers to the meaning of addition of fractions. For the others, the connection was tenuous at best. These authors did not incorporate an appropriate combining action into their story problems. We wondered if they just assumed that fraction pieces must be shared or given away before they could be operated on. Whatever the explanation for students’ difficulty incorporating appropriate joining actions into their stories, it is clear that many students strongly associate sharing and other subtraction ideas with fractions.",47,mtms2010-08-27a,,
iMPlications FoR teaching,48,mtms2010-08-27a,,
"As Barlow and Drake (2008) noted, having students write original story problems for particular expressions or equations allows teachers to assess their students’ levels of mathematical understanding. The writing task described here provided us with insight into three particular elements of students’ fraction (mis)understanding. Looking at each of these elements, we have three recommendations to offer.  1. Provide Multiple Models",49,mtms2010-08-27a,,
"Multiple aspects of the students’ stories indicated that they had a narrow view of fractions and may not have  had experience with a wide enough variety of fraction models. Within the familiar area model, students might benefit from exploring fractions of regions that are not circles. Students might also benefit from experiences with the set and measure models. Set models could include a dozen eggs, a six-pack of soda, or a deck of fiftytwo cards. Measuring models could include length (inches, feet, and meters); time, capacity (cups and liters); and weight (pounds and grams).",50,mtms2010-08-27a,,
2. Pay Attention to the Units and the Whole,51,mtms2010-08-27a,,
"Students’ difficulty with unit consistency suggested that they are doing most of their fraction work with numbers that are devoid of units or context. In these computational environments, students do not have to think about the meaning of quantities. Students could be working on fractional quantities in a variety of meaningful contexts. For example, one situation could involve determining how far they have gone if running 1/2 mile now and 2/3 mile later; this scenario could help them understand that their answer will also need to be in miles. ",52,mtms2010-08-27a,,
"We encourage teachers to emphasize the notion of units, even insisting that students write the answer with units after the number, despite the possible objection that it is too much trouble to answer “3/4 apple” or “3/4 mile,” rather than just a simple “3/4.” This attention will help students keep in mind that there is always a whole to which the fraction refers, and this whole remains the same when fractions are combined.  that some of the pieces have to be missing. However, the stories were not always clear as to what was broken up, what it looked like when it was whole, and if the missing pieces were more important to the story than the parts that were still there. ",53,mtms2010-08-27a,,
"We contend that students’ informal  experiences with sharing aspects of fractions need to be solidified before students start to operate on fractions. Once students have a firm understanding of fractional quantities, they should be given many opportunities to make sense of combining and separating them. Our collection of stories suggested that class discussions of the distinction between sharing and combining might help students appreciate the role that each plays in fraction contexts. For example, here is a student-generated problem that requires both sharing and adding  1/2 + 2/3:  Three kids are going camping and need to distribute and carry a total of 2 pounds of rice in their backpacks. Just as they are packing up to go, they find out that each one needs to carry an additional 1/2 pound of rice. What is the total weight of the rice in each kid’s pack?",54,mtms2010-08-27a,,
Our experience with the studentauthored story problems was another reminder of the message shared by Riddle and Rodzwell (2000) that many students have a limited understanding of fractions because instruction jumps too quickly into symbol manipulation without giving students enough time to make sense of fractions.  3. Explore Actions beyond Sharing,55,mtms2010-08-27a,,
"We observed that many students were unable to develop an appropriate interpretation of addition in the fraction context. Instead, many stories implied that fractions meant that something was shared or broken into pieces and  conclUsion",56,mtms2010-08-27a,,
"We encourage teachers to try this assessment tool with their students to see if some of their students have the same limited understanding apparent in many of the problems we collected. If so, stepping back and helping  students make sense of fractions in meaningful contexts may prevent further confusion. When students falter with fractions, as many of the college freshman that Feynman talked with did, the fault may be ours for rushing them too quickly through this complex terrain of fraction concepts.",57,mtms2010-08-27a,,
