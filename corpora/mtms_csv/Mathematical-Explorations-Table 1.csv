3,"Mathematical Explorations: Exercise Away the Big Mac: Ratios, Rates, and Proportions in Context","Proportional reasoning is defined as a cornerstone concept that lays the groundwork for students’ understanding of higher-level mathematical concepts such as those in algebra and measurement. On March 11, 2013, NCTM published a Research Brief on ratio and proportion, highlighting the need for extended time to be allocated to ratio and proportion study at the middle school level. Understanding percentages and the concepts of ratio and rate is essential for the development of a student’s proportional reasoning ability.

7,"Mathematical Explorations: Exercise Away the Big Mac: Ratios, Rates, and Proportions in Context","The activity described below helps  students think proportionally by presenting a realistic context. In the Research Brief, NCTM raises the question, “How should teachers balance teaching skills versus concepts?” One central concept in proportional reasoning is “learning to attend to two quantities simultaneously” in a multiplicative manner (NCTM 2013, p. 1), which involves tracking multiplicative change in both quantities. We believe that the food context can be beneficial in helping students think about two quantities simultaneously.

9,"Mathematical Explorations: Exercise Away the Big Mac: Ratios, Rates, and Proportions in Context","For this activity, allow two class sessions. The materials that will be  needed are a laptop computer and the activity sheets. Give students these instructions:  You will work in pairs today and share a laptop computer. Please take turns when completing the computer activities. Work with your partner to answer questions 1-3 on activity sheet 1. After all groups have finished, the class will reconvene to answer questions 1-3. We will repeat this process for questions 4-5 on activity sheet 1 and throughout activity sheet 2.",9,"Mathematical Explorations: Exercise Away the Big Mac: Ratios, Rates, and Proportions in Context"
10,"Mathematical Explorations: Exercise Away the Big Mac: Ratios, Rates, and Proportions in Context","We completed this activity in  two sixth-grade classes in one school and in three mixed sixth-grade and seventh-grade classes in another. Students were paired, and each pair had access to a laptop computer. We also suggest providing a calculator or pointing students to basic calculator software on their computer to complete computations during the activity. We did not want students to have to calculate Big Mac percentages by hand. ",10,"Mathematical Explorations: Exercise Away the Big Mac: Ratios, Rates, and Proportions in Context"
11,"Mathematical Explorations: Exercise Away the Big Mac: Ratios, Rates, and Proportions in Context","Working in pairs, students helped  each other follow the activity, both conceptually and technologically. We instructed students to work through  the activity sheets and share ideas in sections, rather than working on the entire task at once. In this way, we were able to follow the pair work with whole-class discussions. Thus, all students received feedback on their work. We completed this activity in one class session. However, based on our experience, we suggest that teachers allow two sessions for this activity.",11,"Mathematical Explorations: Exercise Away the Big Mac: Ratios, Rates, and Proportions in Context"
12,"Mathematical Explorations: Exercise Away the Big Mac: Ratios, Rates, and Proportions in Context","Potential stRengths  and diFFicUlties Students had difficulty reading the  Big Mac nutrition table provided on the McDonald’s website. Some students used grams of fat, rather than calories from fat, to write the first ratio of calories from fat to total calories. They found 29/550 instead of 260/550. Other students mistook the percentage, 45, that appears online in the same cell with 29 g of fat for the percentage of calories from fat. The 45 percent in the online table is actually the percentage of the recommended daily amount of fat that the 29 g represents. Nowhere in the McDonald’s table, nor to our knowledge in any other nutrition table, is this information provided. Therefore, we suggest that teachers discuss how to read a nutrition table before starting the activity.",12,"Mathematical Explorations: Exercise Away the Big Mac: Ratios, Rates, and Proportions in Context"
13,"Mathematical Explorations: Exercise Away the Big Mac: Ratios, Rates, and Proportions in Context","At times, students answered the  questions using their nonmathematical knowledge of the context. One student stated that because it does not contain fruits and vegetables, it is not in the healthy percentage range of calories from fat. Although we want students to use the context (and their related knowledge) in the problem-solving process, we do not want them to ignore the math completely. We need to ensure that the context is supportive and helpful when students construct and use their mathematical knowledge. In this case, we asked whether fruits and vegetables are the only food sources with a healthy percentage of fat and followed up by asking how ",13,"Mathematical Explorations: Exercise Away the Big Mac: Ratios, Rates, and Proportions in Context"

15,"Mathematical Explorations: Exercise Away the Big Mac: Ratios, Rates, and Proportions in Context","It was encouraging to see that  students used various ways to answer the missing value proportion question in question 1 on activity sheet 2. To solve, students used a variety of approaches. They— •	 calculated	a	unit	rate	(61/10	=	6.1	 and then divided 550 by 6.1); •	 divided	550	by	61	and	then	  multiplied by 10;  •	 estimated	by	creating	equivalent	 fractions nearly equal to the ratio 61/10 (6 ×	9	=	54,	so	60	×	9	=	540);	 or  •	 set	up	and	solved	the	proportion 61 cal.",15,"Mathematical Explorations: Exercise Away the Big Mac: Ratios, Rates, and Proportions in Context"

20,"Mathematical Explorations: Exercise Away the Big Mac: Ratios, Rates, and Proportions in Context","The goal of this activity was not to teach or focus on any specific skill. We started with a concept situated in a context and allowed students to formulate their own solution paths. By asking students to present their solutions to the whole class and providing the correct language and vocabulary for the strategies and solutions, we emphasized different skills and extended students’ spectrum of strategies for solving future problems. We believe that this approach  demonstrates the balance between concepts and supporting skills that NCTM suggested in the Research Brief (2013). For example, for the first bullet, teachers can reiterate the strategy after the student presents it to the class. For example, “Sarah first calculated the unit rate by dividing 61 by 10 to find out how many calories Lori would burn in 1 minute, and then she divided 550 by 6.1 to find out how long, or how many minutes, it would take to burn off the calories in a Big Mac.” This strategy is even more powerful when another student is able to provide the summary statement.",20,"Mathematical Explorations: Exercise Away the Big Mac: Ratios, Rates, and Proportions in Context"
21,"Mathematical Explorations: Exercise Away the Big Mac: Ratios, Rates, and Proportions in Context","The students who set up a proportion found an answer of approximately 9; some students, however, stated  9 hours and some stated 9 minutes. The 9 minute answer was not troublesome for some despite knowing that Lori would burn only 61 calories in 10 minutes. We know, and students know, too, that for most of the textbook questions, once students set up a proportion and solve it, they are done. Thinking about 9 units of 10 minutes was not automatic and was difficult for some students. We needed to remind them that the unit of time involved Lori burning 61 calories. Then we had a class discussion about what the result of 9 meant.",21,"Mathematical Explorations: Exercise Away the Big Mac: Ratios, Rates, and Proportions in Context"
22,"Mathematical Explorations: Exercise Away the Big Mac: Ratios, Rates, and Proportions in Context","During the activity, only question 7  from activity sheet 2 did not require  computation. It asked if another  student would need to jog less time or more time to burn the same amount of calories. Students responded with “more time.” First, we needed to ask if a person who carried more weight would burn more calories or fewer calories per minute of activity. ",22,"Mathematical Explorations: Exercise Away the Big Mac: Ratios, Rates, and Proportions in Context"
23,"Mathematical Explorations: Exercise Away the Big Mac: Ratios, Rates, and Proportions in Context","After establishing “more calories,”  we discussed whether it would take more time or less time. This “qualitative” question included two questions, which each required quantitative reasoning. To help students with this more complicated question, we added another qualitative question earlier in the activity. Knowing that Lori would burn more calories by jogging, we asked whether it would take more time or less time to burn a Big Mac when Lori jogs. A rich discussion ensued with the qualitative question; by adding one more question, we wanted to help students improve their proportional reasoning by being able to think about a proportion without making any computations.

24,"Mathematical Explorations: Exercise Away the Big Mac: Ratios, Rates, and Proportions in Context","We asked questions in a certain order to scaffold students’ responses: “For every calorie Lori burns, how many does Kim burn?” First, we asked them to find the ratio of the calories Kim burns to the calories Lori burns, which is 71/61. However, the transition from 71/61 to 1.16/1 was not straightforward. After having a class discussion, rereading the question, and highlighting the part “for every calorie Lori burns,” one student suggested computing the unit rate. At that point, they were able to see the equivalent ratios  550 cal.",24,"Mathematical Explorations: Exercise Away the Big Mac: Ratios, Rates, and Proportions in Context"

29,"Mathematical Explorations: Exercise Away the Big Mac: Ratios, Rates, and Proportions in Context","We observed, as did Singh (2000),  that some students still think additively when they work with ratio  and proportion. For example, when asked to create the ratio in the first question, one group wrote 290. When asked how they found 290, students said they subtracted 260 from 550. Another group subtracted 61 from 71 when finding how many calories Kim burns for every calorie that Lori burns. Knowing that multiplicative thinking does not come naturally to all students, teachers need to expect these kinds of responses and be prepared to discuss these issues. Help students use additive thinking based on repeated addition as a bridge to multiplicative thinking.",29,"Mathematical Explorations: Exercise Away the Big Mac: Ratios, Rates, and Proportions in Context"

31,"Mathematical Explorations: Exercise Away the Big Mac: Ratios, Rates, and Proportions in Context","We asked students their opinions about the activity. If they liked it, we asked what they enjoyed. They understood the McDonald’s real-life connection. They liked being surprised with results, such as learning that it takes three hours of walking to burn the calories from a Big Mac and trying to figure out what to remove from a Big Mac to calculate a healthy percentage. One student even shared that now he knows what he needs to do when he eats a Big Mac.",31,"Mathematical Explorations: Exercise Away the Big Mac: Ratios, Rates, and Proportions in Context"
32,"Mathematical Explorations: Exercise Away the Big Mac: Ratios, Rates, and Proportions in Context","We believe that the authentic context helped to motivate students and keep their interest. Moreover, the context helped students think about two quantities simultaneously, as might occur in real life. When a student responded to the question asking how long Lori needs to jog to burn a Big Mac, he created an equivalent fraction with rounded numbers (6 ×	9	=	54,	so	 60 ×	9	=	540)	as	one	would	do	in	real	 life to reason proportionally. Although we are unsure if he will be able to set up a proportion formally and execute the cross-multiplication procedure, we believe that he had a grasp of the concept. As NCTM suggested in the Research Brief, he is at the stage at which he can “engage in repeated reasoning . . . by thinking through the  logic of ratio and proportion problems again and again . . . [and] be encouraged to formalize . . . repeated reasoning into a general procedure that can be applied to many different problems” (2013, p. 4).
