"Perspectives on  the Design and Development of School Mathematics Curricula provides information concerning the development of several mathematics  curricula funded by the National Science Foundation. The curricula described are not traditional in that they consist primarily of skill development and do not involve applications, thematic units, and problem solving. Each description explores how the curriculum was developed, the pedagogical viewpoint of developers, major components, professional development  and teacher support, problems encountered in its implementation, and distinguishing characteristics. The explanations are objective and informative. Many of the descriptions are written by an author of the curriculum, thereby providing in-depth and anecdotal information concerning its development, the rationale of the development process, and some persuasive views and statements concerning its benefits. ",5,mtms2008-11-255a,,
"Even though some of the explanations about the curricula appear to be somewhat persuasive toward particular products, they nevertheless provide valuable information that is important when selecting materials. I would recommend this book to anyone in the process of obtaining mathematics curricula.",6,mtms2008-11-255a,,

Most teachers today are looking for ways to increase multiculturalism in their classrooms. The universal qualities of mathematics make it a challenging subject area in which to reflect diversity. Drawings from Angola is a gem because it not only reflects ,11,mtms2008-11-255a,,

diversity but also contains substantive mathematical content. ,13,mtms2008-11-255a,,
"The book begins with a brief geography and history lesson on Angola to orient students to the country. The Cokwe people of Angola are introduced, and their tradition of drawing in the sand is explored. The drawings are composed of rectangular arrays and lines, and each drawing can have a particular rhythm. The book presents various drawings and stories with activities that invite students to either interpret or make a drawing. Students are then directed to look at the drawings from the point of view of the axes of symmetry, specifically, rotational symmetry. Finally, the drawings are used to demonstrate summing patterns. As in the beginning, activities continue to be sprinkled throughout. ",14,mtms2008-11-255a,,
"Drawings from Angola can be used  with most grade levels, because the material can be simplified or expanded. I found this book to be valuable as a source to explore how other people use mathematics. ",15,mtms2008-11-255a,,

"In Hypatia, the author attempts to make the first woman of mathematics  come alive for middle school students. I believe she succeeds. Not much is known about the details of Hypatia’s life, but this text weaves fact and plausible descriptions of the times and events to deliver an interesting read about Hypatia, her life, and her times. Her end at the hands of a mob is handled with care. ",18,mtms2008-11-255a,,
"The text contains many photographs, illustrations, and maps that embellish the story of Hypatia’s life. Many of the illustrations are clearly from  museums and historical collections. These visual images add to the story of a remarkable woman. They made the text come alive for me and will certainly engage any middle schooler. The book also contains an effective glossary and a descriptive timeline of Hypatia’s life. ",19,mtms2008-11-255a,,
"My one concern is that Hypatia’s  mathematical findings are not detailed. Her writings are described, but no particulars are given. True, few specifics of Hypatia’s work have survived, but perhaps the author could have included one of the problems attributed to her, such as this:",20,mtms2008-11-255a,,

A K Peters; (781) 416-2888; www.akpeters.com.  accompanied by quality illustrations, are easy to follow. This would be an excellent reference for members of a mathematics club who are looking for projects. ",25,mtms2008-11-255a,,
"Through detailed instructions and illustrations, the author introduces the reader to modular origami, a  process of using multiple, identically folded units to assemble threedimensional objects. Basic origami folding skills and terminology are clearly reviewed in a chart. Using the Sonobe unit, one of the earliest recognized pieces in modular origami, directions are given for creating many of the Platonic solids. The author shares her self-created Sonobe-style units and presents three-dimensional designs that are intricate and have much artistic appeal. Some of the unit patterns start with a rectangle rather than the traditional square. Over twenty-five different constructions are shown. Making floral ball models, with names such as Phlox Ball or Petunia Floral or the more precisely titled dodecahedron models, will provide challenge and, by the author’s wishes, inspiration. ",26,mtms2008-11-255a,,
Of special appeal to mathematicians who enjoy this craft is a section of the book that explains mathematical relationships in the designs of selected units. The author also suggests geometric proofs based on the lines and angles created by the folds of a unit’s construction.,27,mtms2008-11-255a,,

"Classic Thinking Games with Java provides challenging supplemental material for the gifted mathematics or computer programming class. It details the use of Java to solve traditional, thought-provoking games and puzzles. Among the most prevalent is a variety of the Peg Solitaire games, which have complex solutions. A number of two-player games including Connect Four and Qubic are also examined as technological possibilities. ",31,mtms2008-11-255a,,
"Initially, the book can be overwhelming for the student or teacher who does not have a background in computer programming. Software is not included, which can add to the apprehension to delve further into the content. There is an exceptional collection of teacher notes and discussions that would need to be used within a classroom. ",32,mtms2008-11-255a,,
I would recommend this product for the exceptional mathematics or gifted mathematics student from grades 8–11 as an enrichment activity or project or for independent study.,33,mtms2008-11-255a,,
