0,Dilations and the Equation of a Line - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I recently asked a group of eighth-grade students to solve an application problem involving a runnerâ€™s distance with respect to time. The goal was to develop the equation of a line using slope and similar-triangle concepts. The Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSI 2010) suggests that middle school students might abstract the equation of a line as they repeatedly calculate slope and â€œcheck whether points are on a line through (1, 2) with slope 3â€ (p. 8). Additionally, the Grade 8 content standards assert that students can use similar triangles â€œto explain why the slope m is the same between any two distinct points on a non-vertical line in the coordinate planeâ€ (p. 54). I wanted to link these two Common Core recommendations in a way that makes rich connections to proportional reasoning.",,
1,Dilations and the Equation of a Line - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Students engage in proportional reasoning when they use covariance and multiple comparisons. Without rich connections to proportional reasoning, students may develop inadequate understandings of linear relationships and the equations that model them. Lobato and Ellis (2002) found that some students tended to view the equation y = mx + b as a storage container to place values for m and b, while losing sight of the covariance relationship between the quantities x and y that the equation models. Teachers can improve studentsâ€™ understanding of linear relationships by focusing on realistic situations and directing studentsâ€™ attention toward the dependency of x and y and the covariant relationship expressed in linear equations (Lobato and Ellis 2002).",,
2,Dilations and the Equation of a Line - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Students can also develop a thorough understanding of y = mx + b when they treat slope as an invariant ratio across a family of similar triangles (Sinclair, Pimm, and Skelin 2012). Students are able to apply this thinking to solve problems and make observations using the processes described in the equation of a line, without explicitly developing the equation. They can be given a rate of change (e.g., speed) and one or more known points related by this rate of change. To infer that the information determines a line, students employ the converse of the standard discussed above: If we know that the rates of change between all pairs of points in a collection are equal, then the collection of ordered pairs determines a line.",,
3,Dilations and the Equation of a Line - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"A novel approach, described below, uses dilations of a rate-of-change triangle to abstract the equation of a line. The hypotenuses of all possible dilations of a rate-of-change triangle will span a line. The tools for this approach become available when students understand â€œthat a two-dimensional figure is similar to another if the second can be obtained from the first by a sequence of rotations, reflections, translations, and dilationsâ€ (CCSSI 2010, p. 56). This is transformational geometry.",,
4,Dilations and the Equation of a Line - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Responses from two of the eighth-grade students in our class, Julie and Rob, illustrate studentsâ€™ thinking as they solve a linear relationship problem using similar triangles. Their responses spark ideas for how to leverage this thinking to develop the equation of a line.",,
5,Dilations and the Equation of a Line - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,DEFINITIONS AND TERMINOLOGY,,
6,Dilations and the Equation of a Line - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Standards specify that seventh-grade students should solve problems about scale drawings by relating lengths within and between objects (CCSSI 2010, p. 46). A within ratio compares the lengths of two sides of one triangle. A between (or across) ratio compares the lengths of two corresponding sides of two different triangles. When two triangles are similar, the corresponding within ratios and all across ratios are equal.",,
7,Dilations and the Equation of a Line - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
8,Dilations and the Equation of a Line - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In transformational geometry, two triangles are similar if one can be superimposed onto the other using a sequence of translations, reflections, rotations, or dilations. A dilation of a triangle is obtained by identifying a center of dilation D and a scale factor r. This process moves each point P in the plane to a new location PÂ´. The new location, PÂ´, lies on a line of dilation determined by center D and point P. The point PÂ´ is r times as far from the center D as the original point P. Figure 1 illustrates a dilation of triangle ABC using center D and a scale factor r = 2.",,

10,Dilations and the Equation of a Line - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In figure 2, a group of eighth-grade students argues that a collection of ordered pairs that forms a line has a constant rate of change among all pairs of ordered pairs. Their diagram depicts rate-of-change triangles. A rate-of-change triangle from a point A to a point B is a right triangle with its hypotenuse connecting points A and B. Its vertical and horizontal legs measure |Î”y| and|Î”x|, respectively. The rate of change from any point to another is a within ratio of a rate-of-change triangle, with the appropriate sign (+/-) attached.",,
11,Dilations and the Equation of a Line - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
12,Dilations and the Equation of a Line - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Although it is a proof, the studentsâ€™ argument expresses an understanding of how to use dilations to move one rate-of-change triangle to another. It also shows an understanding of the connection between the slope of the line and the within ratios of rate-of-change triangles. The studentsâ€™ work illustrates that the line through a collection of points is a line of dilation for moving the hypotenuse of one rate-of-change triangle onto another. Other students included four distinct ordered pairs in their argumentâ€™s diagram (referent), which expresses a more generalized approach for using dilations to superimpose one rate-of-change triangle onto another.",,

18,Dilations and the Equation of a Line - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Students in this class had the following daily learning goal: â€œAt the end of this activity, I will be able to use dilations and similar rate-of-change triangles to solve problems involving a runnerâ€™s distances, times, and rate (speed).â€ This goal complemented their weekly learning goal: â€œAt the end of this week, I will be able to make viable arguments using similarity concepts for claims about lines, linear relationships, and rates of change.â€",,
19,Dilations and the Equation of a Line - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,I gave the students a task with a sequence of guided discovery prompts:,,
20,Dilations and the Equation of a Line - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Jana starts running 15 feet from the starting line. After 9 seconds, she notices that she is 57 feet from the starting line. After 21 seconds, [what question am I about to ask you]?",,
21,Dilations and the Equation of a Line - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Next, I asked the students toâ€”",,
22,Dilations and the Equation of a Line - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"â€¢ plot the information provided in the task on a (t, d) coordinate system, in which t and d represent time and distance, respectively;",,
23,Dilations and the Equation of a Line - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,â€¢ construct a rate-of-change triangle from the ordered pairs expressed in the task; and,,
24,Dilations and the Equation of a Line - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,â€¢ use a dilation of the first rate-of-change triangle to create a rate-of-change triangle for the points determined by t = 0 and t = 21 and label the legs appropriately.,,
25,Dilations and the Equation of a Line - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
26,Dilations and the Equation of a Line - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Students had already received lessons on constructing rate-of-change triangles; finding within and across ratios of similar triangles; dilating rate-of-change triangles along a line (a line of dilation); and superimposing one rate-of-change triangle onto another, using both positive and negative scale factors. Students needed this information to continue their work with this lesson.",,
27,Dilations and the Equation of a Line - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Figure 3 displays Julieâ€™s written response to the dilation prompts, which was very similar to Robâ€™s response. When asked about the approaches used to develop their responses, both Julie and Rob reported using the ordered pair (0, 15) as the center of dilation and 21 Ã· 9 as the scale factor. However, they appeared to use a different method in subsequent prompts.",,
28,Dilations and the Equation of a Line - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Figures 4 and 5 display Robâ€™s and Julieâ€™s responses, respectively, to subsequent prompts. In these prompts, I asked students to consider how they can use properties of similar triangles and the values of Î”t to predict Janaâ€™s distance from the starting line after  21 seconds. Their work contains errors. In their responses to (g), Rob mistakenly writes 13 instead of 15, and Julie creates a false equation when she combines two processes into one equation. Julie also mislabels the units in the left-hand side of her equation. Nevertheless, the responses express appropriate approaches for predicting Janaâ€™s distance. It is not clear, however, that these students had yet connected dilation approaches to solving the problem in task (g).",,
29,Dilations and the Equation of a Line - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
30,Dilations and the Equation of a Line - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,COMMENTARY ON STUDENT RESPONSES,,
31,Dilations and the Equation of a Line - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In response to prompt (g), some students used a dilation factor 21/9 (which is equivalent to 98/42) found in earlier prompts to determine the length of the vertical side of a rate-of-change triangle from point (0, 15) to (21, ?): 21/9 Ã— 42. This is across-triangle proportional reasoning because the length of the vertical leg of a rate-of-change triangle from (0, 15) to (9, 57) is multiplied by a scale factor obtained by finding an across-triangleor between-triangle ratio. If we assume that Jana ran the entire distance at a constant rate of change, then her distance from the starting line would be 21/9 Ã— 42 + 15. Notice that the scale factor is not Janaâ€™s rate of change.",,
32,Dilations and the Equation of a Line - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
33,Dilations and the Equation of a Line - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Julie and Rob approached prompt (g) differently and do not appear to have used the dilation work they reported in previous prompts. After multiplying the ratio 42/9 by Î”t = 21,they added Janaâ€™s initial distance from the starting line. Julieâ€™s and Robâ€™s thinking can be described as within-triangle thinking because the ratio used in the approach compares the side lengths within only one triangle. Notice that this ratio is Janaâ€™s rate of change.",,
34,Dilations and the Equation of a Line - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"When asked about his work, Rob stated:",,
35,Dilations and the Equation of a Line - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I knew this triangle . . . is 42 tall and 9 wide, and I just divided 42 by 9 and then dilated by 21. I got 98 and added 15. . . . This is kind of the triangleâ€™s side lengths, and I wanted to make it larger so that it is 21 seconds, and since 21 is seconds, I multiplied by 21 and got 98. And, since the y-intercept is 15, I added 15.",,
36,Dilations and the Equation of a Line - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Rob claims to use dilations, but he uses a different scale factor than he reported earlier. Robâ€™s solution method is better described as proportional reasoning using within-triangle thinking because he first finds a within ratio.",,
37,Dilations and the Equation of a Line - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"A variety of approaches are possible for determining Î”d and the unknown in (21, ?). Some approaches, such as Julieâ€™s and Robâ€™s, do not directly involve dilations. When the instructional goal is to use dilations, comparing and contrasting different approaches allows the class to discuss how some approaches lead to the â€œdilationsâ€ goal, whereas other approaches need to be modified to achieve that goal. Julieâ€™s and Robâ€™s work presented the opportunity to modify the studentsâ€™ reported approaches, align their reported approaches with their written work, and extend their thinking to meet the goal of the lesson.",,
38,Dilations and the Equation of a Line - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Toward this end, I showed Rob the approach used by other students and asked him to discuss similarities and differences. The following is an excerpt of that conversation:",,
39,Dilations and the Equation of a Line - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Rob: Itâ€™s just using within instead of across. This is within [points with two fingers to the two legs of the rate-of-change triangle from (0, 15) to (9, 42)]. This is across [points with two fingers to the corresponding horizontal legs of his two rate-of-change triangles, which are similar to those in fig. 1].",,
40,Dilations and the Equation of a Line - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Yopp: What did you do?,,
41,Dilations and the Equation of a Line - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Rob:I did within.,,
42,Dilations and the Equation of a Line - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Yopp:The one [approach] I just told you about?,,
43,Dilations and the Equation of a Line - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Rob: Across.,,
44,Dilations and the Equation of a Line - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Dilation approaches correspond to across-triangle reasoning because any across ratio (or its reciprocal) of similar triangles is a scale factor for superimposing one triangle onto the other. In particular, Rob was able to distinguish between within-triangleand across-triangle thinking, and he could identify dilation factors.",,
45,Dilations and the Equation of a Line - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,BRIDGING THE GAP BETWEEN â€œSTATICâ€ GEOMETRY AND â€œDYNAMICâ€ GEOMETRY,,
46,Dilations and the Equation of a Line - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We might view Julieâ€™s approach in figure 5, part (i), as static geometry because the proportion she creates compares two â€œfixedâ€ situations modeled by two triangles. Dilations are dynamic because they involve changing one triangle continuously to obtain others. This is important because as Jana runs, her distance changes as time elapses. Students can model this change by â€œgrowingâ€ rate-of-change triangles.",,
47,Dilations and the Equation of a Line - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
48,Dilations and the Equation of a Line - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Robâ€™s and Julieâ€™s approaches, with modification, can connect to slope and dilation concepts in the following way: A dilation of 21 corresponds to a dilation of a rate-of-change triangle with vertex (0, 15), a horizontal leg of length 1, and a vertical leg of length 42/9. Figure 6 expresses this transformation. Although Rob reported his triangle dilating by 21, the triangle that his scale factor dilates was not depicted in his diagrams, and he may not have been aware of this geometry. The scale factor of 21 dilates a rate-of-change triangle whose vertical leg is 42/9 (Î”y/Î”x or Î”d/Î”t)as shown in figure 6.",,
49,Dilations and the Equation of a Line - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,GENERALIZING THE PROCESS,,
50,Dilations and the Equation of a Line - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Julieâ€™s and Robâ€™s modified approaches involve multiplying an x-value by the rate of change and then adding the y-intercept to that result. This process is the function expressed in the equation of a line. After discussion, our class generalized the process, relating it to the diagrams in figure 6. The summary that follows is abstracted from our discussion.",,
51,Dilations and the Equation of a Line - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Assume that we have a collection of ordered pairs known to have a constant rate of change among all pairs of ordered pairs. Create a rate-of-change triangle between any two points on the line. A dilation can be used to create a rate-of-change triangle that has a leftmost vertex on the y-axis and a horizontal leg of length 1. The vertical leg will have length Î”y/Î”x,which is equal to a within ratioof the first triangle created and is the rate of change from Janaâ€™s starting ordered pair to her second ordered pair. Call this rate-of-change triangle the base rate-of-change triangle.",,
52,Dilations and the Equation of a Line - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Because we predicted that Jana runs at a constant rate of change, all rate-of-change triangles are similar (one needs right-triangle properties for this). Because the triangles are similar, we can dilate our base rate-of-change triangle using the vertex on the y-axis as the center of dilation to create a rate-of-change triangle that includes any other point in the collection. The hypotenuses of these rate-of-change triangles are coincident with a line of dilation.",,

54,Dilations and the Equation of a Line - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"1. Let A(x1, y1) and B(x2, y2), with x2 > x1, be any two known ordered pairs in a collection with a constant rate of change. Let C(x, ?) be an ordered pair, whose x-coordinate is given and whose y-coordinate is unknown and is assumed to be in a linear relationship with A and B.",,

56,Dilations and the Equation of a Line - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,3. Choose B as the center of dilation and choose the scale factor x2/(x2 â€“ x1). Dilate the rate-of-change triangle from A to B. This process creates a rate-of-change triangle with one vertex AÂ´ on the y-axis and another vertex at B. Dilate this rate-of-change triangle using AÂ´ as the center and 1/x2 as the scale factor. This creates a rate-of-change triangle with a horizontal leg of length 1 (see fig. 6a).,,
57,Dilations and the Equation of a Line - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,4. Dilate our base triangle using the vertex AÂ´ on the y-axis as the center of dilation and using a scale or dilation factor of x (see fig. 6b).,,

62,Dilations and the Equation of a Line - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In figure 6, x is depicted by a positive value, yet the approach works for negative values of x as well. Dilations by negative values have images on the opposite side of the y-axis and create rate-of-change triangles that lie on the opposite side of the line. Other related approaches for developing the equation of the line using dilations, such as the one presented in figure 7, are possible.",,

64,Dilations and the Equation of a Line - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,DISCUSSION,,
65,Dilations and the Equation of a Line - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Students can use dilations to navigate among rate-of-change triangles for points in a linear relationship. The rate of change between two points is a within ratio of a rate-of-change triangle between the two points. Dilations of rate-of-change triangles offer ways to develop the equation of a line. Dilation tasks can involve a runnerâ€™s speed and motivate geometric properties of a line. Critical to this development is a geometric understanding of rate of change as the lengths of the legs of a rate-of-change triangle.,,
66,Dilations and the Equation of a Line - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Although there are other ways to develop the equation of a line, I emphasize dilations because the approach uses similar triangles to produce the equation of a line naturally and meaningfully. Using dilations can emphasize proportional reasoning because of the multiple comparisons of legs of triangles and the covariant relationships between horizontal and vertical legs of these triangles. As students use properties of one rate-of-change triangle and a known dimension of another to find an unknown dimension, they illustrate the covariance relationship between x and y expressed in the equation of a line.",,
