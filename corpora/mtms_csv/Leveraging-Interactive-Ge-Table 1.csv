0,Leveraging Interactive Geometry Software to Prompt Discussion - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Ask your students to construct a square. What do you think they might do? Some students may use a ruler to create a square-like figure, which they may justify as being a square by stating that the figure has four congruent sides but neglecting to confirm the angle measures. What if you asked them to create a square using interactive geometry software? Although the software can encourage a greater level of precision than pencil-and-paper representations, students may still produce a shape much like that shown in figure 1.",,

2,Leveraging Interactive Geometry Software to Prompt Discussion - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The approach shown is fundamentally imprecise, as it relies ultimately on trial and error. Students who use this method will find that moving any vertex of the figure will result in the deformation of their square (assuming that they manage to successfully create a right angle in the first place). How can we, as teachers, encourage students to move from drawing geometric objects to constructing them and thereby build their mathematical reasoning skills?",,
3,Leveraging Interactive Geometry Software to Prompt Discussion - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"One way to encourage students to construct instead of draw shapes and to help students develop more robust understandings of geometric relationships and constructions is to use interactive geometry software, such as The Geometerâ€™s Sketchpad (or Sketchpad) or GeoGebra. (GeoGebra, free to download from http://www.geogebra.org, can also be used online through an applet found at the same website.) On their own, such software programs have tools that allow students to produce multiple different representations of a two-dimensional shape. Such shapes can include a drawing that represents only one particular version of the shape or a geometric construction that can represent an entire class of shapes that share certain necessary and sufficient properties of the shapeâ€™s definition. The challenge for teachers using this software in class is to develop the depth and sophistication of studentsâ€™ thinking. In fact, we can leverage the dynamic nature of the software to support students in moving beyond drawing geometrically defined shapes by sight to constructing shapes by challenging them to change aspects of a particular representation of a shape while maintaining its underlying properties.",,
4,Leveraging Interactive Geometry Software to Prompt Discussion - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The activity in this article is an introductory exploration of interactive geometry software (shown here with GeoGebra), an effective probe of studentsâ€™ understanding of basic geometric definitions, and a blueprint for orchestrating a discussion that can help students work on their mathematical reasoning skills. The Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSM) asks seventh-grade students to â€œdraw, construct, and describe geometrical figures and describe the relationships between themâ€ (CCSSI 2010, p. 49). This activity addresses this standard and reinforces fourth-grade and fifth-grade standards for students to â€œclassify shapes by properties of their lines and anglesâ€ and â€œclassify two-dimensional figures into categories based on their propertiesâ€ (CCSSI 2010, pp. 28, 34). This activity also helps students develop a foundation for high school geometry in which they are required to construct geometric figures. In a summary of research done on interactive geometry software, Hollebrands, Laborde, and Strasser (2008) assert that such programs allow teachers a clearer picture of studentsâ€™ thinking as they complete construction tasks. The activity in this article is an example of a â€œconstruction task [that] induces the need to use geometrical knowledgeâ€ (Hollebrands, Laborde, and Strasser, p. 190). The structured discussion that follows the activity is based on the framework for discussions established by Kazemi and Hintz (2014).",,
5,Leveraging Interactive Geometry Software to Prompt Discussion - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,The goals of this activity are these:,,
6,Leveraging Interactive Geometry Software to Prompt Discussion - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,1. To encourage students to think abstractly about geometric objects by having them construct those objects from their definitions,,
7,Leveraging Interactive Geometry Software to Prompt Discussion - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,2. To allow students to explore the difference between drawing and constructing,,
8,Leveraging Interactive Geometry Software to Prompt Discussion - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,3. To prompt and anchor a discussion about the importance of construction in geometry,,
9,Leveraging Interactive Geometry Software to Prompt Discussion - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,It should be noted that this activity and the directions discussed were designed for use with GeoGebra. (See the sidebar.) Finzer and Bennet (1995) discuss similar ways in which to use Sketchpad to help students begin to understand the distinction between drawing and constructing.,,
10,Leveraging Interactive Geometry Software to Prompt Discussion - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Although this is a good introductory activity for interactive geometry software, students should first have the opportunity to explore the softwareâ€™s tools and capabilities. This can take the form of simply letting students play with the program themselves for some time or by having students work through the tutorials. (Marc Renault provides a set of tutorials for GeoGebra at http://webspace.ship.edu/msrenault/tutorial but a quick Internet search yields many others.) This activity can be facilitated by using either the downloaded software or the online applet. It is also possible to use the tablet app, but students might find it challenging to achieve the same level of precision with a tablet and stylus (or finger) as they can attain with a computer and a separate mouse. However, given a choice between using a tablet and using a laptop with a touchpad mouse, the tablet is preferable. To be successful at this activity, students need to be familiar with the basic tools for construction provided by the software: plotting points, creating segments and lines, making parallel and perpendicular lines, and drawing circles. If students keep the coordinate grid visible in the drawing plane, they can draw on their spatial reasoning skills and previous knowledge about the Cartesian coordinate system, although approaches of this sort may not prove as fruitful as students might hope.",,
11,Leveraging Interactive Geometry Software to Prompt Discussion - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The results and recommendations presented in this article come from facilitating this lesson with geometry students who had access to a very small laptop with a touchpad mouse. The students with whom I worked were familiar enough with technology that they figured out the small tasks in the online GeoGebra tutorials quickly on their own and usually with only a cursory reference to the directives given in the tutorial. These students generally did not have any difficulties accessing and using the GeoGebra tools that they needed in productive and appropriate ways, nor did they struggle very much with the physical demands of using the laptop. However, this may not be the case for every classroom. Thus, this activity is best used once students have had sufficient time to familiarize themselves with both the software and the computing devices.",,
12,Leveraging Interactive Geometry Software to Prompt Discussion - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,IMPLEMENTING THE LESSON,,
13,Leveraging Interactive Geometry Software to Prompt Discussion - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Once students have had a chance to explore the software, students are given a copy of the activity (see activity sheet 1). However, some teachers may want to review the different types of quadrilaterals and triangles if they feel that their students have not engaged with those definitions for some time because this activity gives students the opportunity to interact meaningfully with these definitions. Moreover, in this exploration, students are asked (implicitly) to identify sets of properties that are necessary and sufficient for defining each shape. For example, to successfully construct a square, a student needs to coordinate all aspects of the definition: Not only must all four sides be congruent, but all angles must also be right angles. The ways in which students think about these definitions can influence their attempts at construction. For example, one method of construction was described as follows: â€œI created point A and point B. Then I created two other points and connected them. Then I used the Move tool and moved it around until it showed that all the segments were equal, and it showed they were equal in the Algebra Window.â€ This student clearly considered only part of the definition of a squareâ€”the requirement for congruent sidesâ€”as necessary for the creation of a square.",,
14,Leveraging Interactive Geometry Software to Prompt Discussion - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The structure for an Open Strategy Sharing lesson plan proposed by Kazemi and Hintz (2014), followed by their Whatâ€™s Best and Why? discussion format, provides an ideal structure for helping students notice and articulate the differences between drawing and constructing geometric objects, as well as allowing them to notice the affordances and drawbacks of particular creation strategies. Roughly outlined, this lesson plan requires launching the task as described above, taking note of studentâ€™s strategies, choosing students whose strategies should be presented to the whole class, and having the whole class discuss which strategy is best and why.",,
15,Leveraging Interactive Geometry Software to Prompt Discussion - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Once the lesson is launched and students have an opportunity to begin their explorations, teachers will want to note the different methods of constructions that students produce. Since this activity is structured so that students who are inclined to draw the first object have the opportunity to do so, students who have not had much experience with creating geometric objects independently, whether on paper or with dynamic geometry software, are likely to attempt to draw (not construct) the first object: a parallelogram. As students try to articulate their method of creation in step 4 of the activity, look for explanations that do not include the use of the parallel line tool because it is likely that these students did not construct parallelograms and only drew them. When I introduced this activity in class, almost half the students used their coordinate intuition to create parallel line segments using the Cartesian coordinate grid. When these students deformed their parallelograms in step 6, their shapes did not retain the properties of parallelograms.",,
16,Leveraging Interactive Geometry Software to Prompt Discussion - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"This type of strategy is good to highlight for the Whatâ€™s Best and Why? portion of the discussion, along with a strategy that relies on construction. Students will notice the differences between the two strategies when each figure is deformed. In the resulting discussion, look for students to describe creating a parallelogram by constructing parallel lines using the softwareâ€™s parallel line tool, ensuring that the opposite sides will remain parallel even after the shape is deformed.",,
17,Leveraging Interactive Geometry Software to Prompt Discussion - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"A student who used this approach reasoned that â€œmy shape is a parallelogram because opposite sides are all parallel.â€ It is important to note that the generality of this reasoning should be highlighted. Students may also assert that opposite sides are parallel by citing that the specific slope measures of the opposite sides are numerically equal; this reasoning is as dependent on the specific figure as the following student statement. Using a coordinate intuition approach, another student reasoned: â€œHow you can tell that itâ€™s a parallelogram is looking at the points [in segment AB] and telling if one side of points slide out by the same amount.â€ Make sure that students understand that although both approaches rely on the â€œconstructionâ€ of parallel lines, the coordinate intuition approach relies on a specific parallel line (or line segment), so this approach does not result in a general parallelogram but a specific one.",,
18,Leveraging Interactive Geometry Software to Prompt Discussion - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"As demonstrated by these student responses, asking students to reason about their constructions can result in a variety of answers. The Whatâ€™s Best and Why? discussion format allows teachers to compare and contrast these attempts at reasoning, as discussed above. The timing of this discussion is up to the teacher, but a good time to hold it may be right after most students have attempted to create their parallelograms. This timing has the potential to encourage students who have been relying on drawing strategies to try the construction strategy that they saw presented. It is important at this stage to encourage students to revise their approach for subsequent shapes as well, this time keeping in mind that they will be dragging one point and changing their figure. Students should be prompted to focus on generating creation strategies that will ensure the preservation of the shapeâ€™s defining properties.",,
19,Leveraging Interactive Geometry Software to Prompt Discussion - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"From a teacherâ€™s point of view, it is easy to assess the robustness of studentsâ€™ geometric constructions during this process. Asking a quick question (â€œPlease move point B around. Do you still have a square?â€) or making a cursory visual inspection of the studentâ€™s open GeoGebra window is usually all that is needed to know whether the student has properly constructed a figure. This is also a good time to identify the studentsâ€™ strategies and decide whether or not it should be included in the sharing of strategies. Strategic placement of the Whatâ€™s Best and Why? discussion may even prompt students to anticipate the robustness of their figures as they work through the list of shapes given in the activity.",,
20,Leveraging Interactive Geometry Software to Prompt Discussion - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,TYPICAL STUDENT RESPONSES,,
21,Leveraging Interactive Geometry Software to Prompt Discussion - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"To run more iterations of the Open Strategy Sharing discussion, it helps to know what types of student creation strategies to look for. Figures 2 and 3 are examples of student strategies that should be shared during the whole-class discussion.",,

24,Leveraging Interactive Geometry Software to Prompt Discussion - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"This is by no means an exhaustive list of strategies; it is likely that different students will produce interesting and rich strategies that are not listed here. Figures 2 and 3 show prototypical examples of student work on squares and parallelograms that are based on actual student work from multiple facilitations of this activity, as well as actual examples of their reasoning and justification. Figure 2 illustrates methods of creating parallelograms, whereas figure 3 shows some examples of how students created squares.",,

26,Leveraging Interactive Geometry Software to Prompt Discussion - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I have used this activity in class with students and with preservice teachers, and I have heard from other teachers who have used it in their own classes. What we have all noticed is that this activity provides a concrete introduction to interactive geometry software as well as a revealing look into studentsâ€™ thinking. Moreover, it provides a useful counterpoint to the usual introduction to quadrilaterals and triangles that most traditional curricula provide. Finally, by setting up a discussion about the difference between drawing and constructing, this activity provides a good grounding for exploring an issue that can be confusing for many students.",,
