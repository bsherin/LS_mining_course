"There is growing recognition that learning to reason algebraically is an essential component of middle-grades mathematics education. But what does it mean to reason algebraically? Blanton and Kaput (2005) describe it as a “process in which students generalize mathematical ideas from a set of particular instances, establish those generalizations through the discourse of argumentation, and express them in increasingly formal and ageappropriate ways” (p. 413). Algebraic reasoning takes various forms, including functional thinking in which  students explore generalizing patterns to describe functional relationships (Blanton and Kaput 2005).",4,mtms2009-08-24a,,

"Mathematics (NCTM 2000) states that focusing on understanding patterns, relations, and functions is a primary goal of algebra instruction. Relationships that are inherent in numerical and geometric (visual) patterns can be represented using words, tables, graphs, and symbols. Students can make and explain generalizations about patterns and use those relationships to make predictions. ",6,mtms2009-08-24a,,
Driscoll (1999) highlights the importance of building rules to represent functions: “Critical to algebraic thinking is the capacity to recognize patterns and reorganize data to represent situations in which input is related to output by well-deﬁ ned functional rules” (p. 2). Working with patterns involves exploring and expressing regularities. ,7,mtms2009-08-24a,,

"In our investigations of growing pattern tasks, we have explored the development of a framework that can be used to characterize the nature and complexity of such tasks. We are particularly interested in visual growing patterns, referred to as geometric patterns (NCTM 2000) or pictorial growth patterns (Billings, Tiedt, and Slater 2007/2008), which involve the use of ﬁ gural objects (Rivera 2007).",30,mtms2009-08-24a,,
"The term ﬁ gural objects refers to  items that possess both spatial properties and conceptual qualities (Rivera 2007, p. 69). Figural means that the objects (or pictures of the same) “possess attributes or exhibit relationships among one another” (Rivera and Becker 2005, p. 199). ",31,mtms2009-08-24a,,
"In exploring geometric patterns (see  ﬁ gs. 1−18), the focus is on the use of inductive reasoning to analyze sequences of ﬁ gural and numerical cues, with numerical cues following a certain numerical order (Rivera and Becker 2005). In particular, we emphasize the use of ﬁ gural reasoning during the process of inductive reasoning. “A numerical mode of inductive reasoning uses algebraic concepts and operations (such as ﬁ nite differences), whereas a ﬁ gural mode relies on relationships that could be drawn visually from a given set of particular instances” (Rivera and Becker 2005, p. 199). ",32,mtms2009-08-24a,,
"When students use ﬁ gural reason- several issues:  ing, they are able to make sense of patterns, such as those in ﬁ gure 1, by paying attention to visual cues that can be organized and translated to numeric sequences. These cues explain and support pattern generalization for function rules.",33,mtms2009-08-24a,,
"As we explored the kinds of geometric pattern tasks that lend them- •  First, we will look at a problemsolving process that supports the use of ﬁ gural reasoning to explore and interpret geometric pattern tasks and generalize function rules.  •  Second, we will discuss a framework for characterizing the complexities of geometric pattern ",34,mtms2009-08-24a,,
Pedagogy for approaching these tasks,35,mtms2009-08-24a,,
"In thinking about the framework, an additional component is the pedagogy that may be used to interact with students as they solve such problems. One common strategy asks students to begin with the ﬁ rst three or four stages in the sequence and use the three phases in table 1 to guide investigation. Another strategy (Friel et al. 2009) involves providing only a third or fourth stage in a geometric pattern sequence and asking students to draw the missing early stages in the sequence to promote backward and forward thinking about possible relationships in the pattern. ",36,mtms2009-08-24a,,
"An interesting variation of a starting-point task is to use a ﬁ gure in a  sequence that does not have an obvious designated place in a sequence. Its structure can be analyzed ﬁ gurally without needing to reference a stage number. Boaler and Humphreys (2005) provide an excellent model using both text and video for a 10 × 10 image from the sequence in ﬁ gure 10. See also a discussion that addresses the use of this task across grade levels, indicating the various ways that different grade levels of students might approach solutions (Ferrini-Mundy, Lappan, and Phillips 1997).",37,mtms2009-08-24a,,
"selves to ﬁ gural reasoning, we found several resources that provide a variety of different tasks. In many instances, they also discuss ways in which these tasks might be analyzed and how they might lead to pattern generalizations for function rules. The analyses varied in their levels of abstraction and in how students were supported in their development of function rules. Although we did not ﬁ nd any discussion of a framework for characterizing the pattern-task complexity, we did ﬁ nd several examples that could be incorporated into a well-developed problem-solving process (Lee and Freiman 2006).

"Friel, Rachlin, and Doyle (2001) provide guidelines for generating and describing growing sequences that are introduced through a variety of contexts that frequently involve geometric pattern tasks. One guideline that highlights ﬁ gural reasoning involves “describing the shapes succinctly with words in such a way that someone who has not seen them will be able to duplicate the sequence” (p. 7).",41,mtms2009-08-24a,,

This strategy involves using the previous ﬁ gure and adding 1 more to each of three “arms.” To ﬁ nd the 43rd stage would require knowing what the 42nd ﬁ gure looked like (how many smiley faces) and then adding 3 more. ,50,mtms2009-08-24a,,

"This reasoning leads to a function rule, again, that connects the input and the output. Students can compare the expression for ﬁ gure A with that for ﬁ gure C and consider the question, “Which of the expressions for the nth shape is a ‘right’ one?” Students can look back to the reasoning that produced each to determine if the expressions are equivalent.  (Note: h refers to horizontal parts, and v refers to vertical parts of the ﬁ gure structure.) quickly to how-many questions. For example, consider the geometric pattern in ﬁ gure 17. Typical how-many questions include the following:  •  How many smiley faces does it  take to make the 10th stage? •  How many smiley faces does it  take to make the 43rd stage? •  How many smiley faces does it take to make the 100th stage? •  How many smiley faces does it  take to make the nth stage?",59,mtms2009-08-24a,,

Three possible strategies and their usefulness in promoting generalizations are discussed in table 2.",61,mtms2009-08-24a,,
"Students can talk through their  ﬁ gural-reasoning strategies and develop rules to match their patterns of thinking. After they have mastered  these items, they can be introduced to the use of tables to record the numerical summaries. Visual strategies can be translated to numerical summaries, preserving a record of the thinking process, by using three-column tables (e.g., Lawrence and Hennessy 2002; Wickett, Kharas, and Burns 2002).

"Before you read on, take another look at the eighteen geometric patterns in ﬁ gures 1−18 on p. 26. Think about sorting the ﬁ gures into two groups:  simple patterns and more complex patterns.  •  Which patterns would you consider simple? Why? •  Which patterns would you consider complex? Why? •  What are the similarities and differences among the patterns? •  How might these similarities  and differences be highlighted to promote different ﬁ gural reasoning strategies?",66,mtms2009-08-24a,,
"Although a teacher can ask various questions about any of these geometric patterns, consider queries that will help focus on ﬁ gural reasoning strategies. As you look at each item, what different patterns do you see? How would you draw or build the  next stage? The 10th stage? The 58th stage? How would you tell someone how to draw any stage in this pattern group? In our analysis of these and many other geometric patterns, in this phase of analysis we have identiﬁ ed several complexities that emerge and that deserve articulation. ",67,mtms2009-08-24a,,
"The most basic geometric pattern reﬂ ects a linear, direct variation relationship, as shown in ﬁ gures 1 and 2, in which the total number of blocks is a multiple of the stage number. Note that we refer to each ﬁ gure in a sequence as a stage number. Other terms, such as ﬁ gure number, pattern number, or picture number, may also be used. These numbers designate the order and sequence of the ﬁ gures within a growing pattern and are the input to a function rule.",68,mtms2009-08-24a,,
"Once you move to phase 2 of the problem-solving process, calculating the total number of blocks involves a single, multiplicative step when relating the pattern number and the number of blocks. Adding a constant to a geometric pattern usually increases its complexity. Notice the difference between the patterns in ﬁ gures 1 and 3. One additional tile is in each stage of the pattern in ﬁ gure 3. This difference may seem minor, but it increases the complexity of the pattern by making  the calculation of the total number of tiles (phase 2) a two-step process involving multiplication (by 1) and addition (plus 2). Thus, the functional relationship of the pattern in ﬁ gure 3 becomes T = n + 1, in which T is the total number of blocks, and n is the stage number. ",69,mtms2009-08-24a,,
"For students who are just beginning to work with geometric patterns, identifying a constant may not be obvious. Figural-reasoning strategies can be prompted in different ways.",70,mtms2009-08-24a,,
"For example, the constant term can be represented using a different color. In ﬁ gures 3, 4, and 7, the constant (plus 1) is shown with a differentcolored tile in each pattern sequence. Constants can also be shown using different shapes; the constants in ﬁ gures 5 and 6 (again, plus 1) are represented by a triangle at the top of the tree and a single center hexagon, respectively.",71,mtms2009-08-24a,,
"What makes the geometric  patterns in ﬁ gures 5 and 11 more complex, however, is that two shapes grow in each successive stage. The tree in ﬁ gure 5 increases by both 1 square and 1 trapezoid in each stage. Students use ﬁ gural reasoning when they observe these relationships. When students transition to phase 2 of the process, since there is n number of squares and n number of trapezoids, one way they can justify the functional relationship is through the rule T = n + n + 1, with the constant of 1 representing the triangle at the top. The pattern in ﬁ gure 11 is more  problematic. The number of hexagons is clear; this value corresponds to the stage number. However, although a student might expect the number of squares to grow by 6 in each stage (add 1 hexagon, so add 6 squares around it), this is not the case. One square can be pictured as overlapping, so that only 5 squares are in fact added in each successive stage. ",72,mtms2009-08-24a,,

"ﬁ gure 9 presents a similar situation. Although a triangular shape is added in each successive stage, only 2 toothpicks are added to the stage, because a third toothpick would overlap with a toothpick already in place from the previous stage. ",76,mtms2009-08-24a,,
"What makes the geometric pattern in ﬁ gure 12 more complex than that in ﬁ gure 7? The difference between these two patterns is only in how they begin, but this makes its function more difﬁ cult to derive. In ﬁ gure 7, the pattern has three spokes in each stage; the number of squares in each spoke corresponds to the stage number (see the student work in ﬁ g. 19). Thus, the functional relationship can be represented by the equation T = 3n + 1. In ﬁ gure 12, the number of squares in each spoke actually corresponds to 1 fewer than the stage number. This functional relationship can be represented by the equation T = 3(n – 1) + 1. Students may have difﬁ culty generating this rule if they are not encouraged to focus on the growing pattern itself and its translation to a numerical pattern through the use of a threecolumn table.",77,mtms2009-08-24a,,
"The geometric patterns in ﬁ gures  14 and 18 are more complex than the others because they represent nonlinear relationships. Although the pattern in ﬁ gure 14 looks exceedingly complex, it is actually well within grasp for students who have had prior experience with geometric patterns, especially in classrooms in which ﬁ gural reasoning has been highlighted. There are multiple ways of seeing the pattern in ﬁ gure 14 (see Smith, Silver, and Stein 2005). In ﬁ gure 20, students present a summary report of their analysis of ﬁ gure 14 with a table showing the pattern structure.

Sasman, Olivier, and Linchevski (cited in Rivera 2007) distinguish between transparent and nontransparent geometric patterns. The other seventeen patterns are transparent patterns; the functional relationships can be obtained easily through ﬁ gural reasoning. However, ﬁ gure 18’s pattern is nontranspar- ent, in that “something more needs to be done before students are able to see a possible function rule from the available cues” (Rivera 2007, p. 72).

Figure 16 brings this same pattern  into three dimensions. The question, “How many smiley face stickers does it take to cover the ﬁ gure?” can promote a rich connection to surface area. Its functional relationship is well within reach of students who are encouraged to articulate their process of ﬁ gural reasoning. Likewise, you may have noticed that the pattern in ﬁ gure 15 is a three-dimensional version of the pattern in ﬁ gure 7.

"Using the FRaMeWoRK With instRUction The increasing emphasis on algebraic thinking across grades K–12 requires that attention be paid to the use of ﬁ gural reasoning. When coupled with an analysis of geometric patterns, students are on the path to developing solid functional thinking. With  this scenario in mind, it is possible to begin to think about the kinds of tasks that might be used at grade 3 versus grade 8. Organizing a loose but reasoned trajectory of growing pattern tasks to be used across grades 2−8 will give teachers and students many opportunities to explore functional thinking in visual settings. One way is to have students investigate “families” of related pattern tasks. ",108,mtms2009-08-24a,,
"For example, ﬁ gure 8 is a count- the-perimeter task (see Smith, Silver, and Stein 2005). What happens when students look at strings of triangles or pentagons or hexagons or other types of patterns composed of more than one kind of polygon? Another possibility is to align choices of pattern tasks that are organized in an instructional sequence and are used within and across multiple grade levels (Smith, Hillen, and Catania 2007). What alignment issues need to be addressed? How might a teacher in grade 8 build on the experiences from those in grade 7? More explicitly, if this alignment process is addressed consistently at all grade levels, how would students’ functional thinking emerge and develop? The answer is possibly at a depth and in ways that we have yet to consider possible. ",109,mtms2009-08-24a,,
"Using geometric pattern tasks to  explore functional relationships has its limitations. Stage numbers are limited to positive numbers, the functional relationships are not continuous, and the contexts are necessarily restricted.
