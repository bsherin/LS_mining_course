"Terry’s teacher was talking about relatively prime numbers. The example being discussed involved 8 natural numbers that were relatively prime to 15 and less than 15 (1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 11, 13, 14). Terry wondered: a.  How many natural numbers less than 100 were relatively  prime to 15? b.  How many natural numbers between 43 and 274 were  relatively prime to 15? c.  How could you determine how many natural numbers were relatively prime to 15 between any pair of natural numbers, a and b? ",4,mtms2012-11-202a,,

"March 2012 issue asked students to examine relatively prime numbers. Part (a) of the problem was fairly straightforward, part (b)’s student work contained a number of common counting errors, and part (c) required that students be precise in their terminology and produce clear explanations. ",6,mtms2012-11-202a,,
"Our own preservice teachers used  one of two common approaches to solving part (a) of this task. The first and most elementary approach was to simply list the numbers from 1 to 100 and eliminate those that had common factors with 15, similar to the sieve of Eratosthenes that is first used in many classrooms to identify prime numbers. Catherine used this strategy as she looked for all the numbers that were not multiples of either 3, 5, or 15 (see fig. 1). She listed the numbers, crossed off the multiples, and then circled the numbers remaining and counted them. Although this method works, it is labor intensive. However, her counting chart illustrates a common issue worth discussing. ",7,mtms2012-11-202a,,
"Students who choose counting charts often produce messy work that contains careless errors, either from writing out their original list or from crossing off numbers. Catherine caught one of her errors; she originally crossed off 43 but then went back and circled it. She also crossed off 67 but did not catch that error. As a result, the labor-intensive work of writing all numbers, crossing off, and counting still produced an incorrect result. Luckily, Catherine also recognized that there was another solution. Her computational approach convinced her that she still had an error in her counting chart that she had not found. She changed her answer to match her computational work. Catherine’s work is not shown here, but it closely matched Samantha’s (see fig. 2). ",8,mtms2012-11-202a,,
"Fig. 1 Catherine listed the numbers and crossed out those with 3, 5, or 15 as  factors. Her work illustrated the potential for errors using this approach.",9,mtms2012-11-202a,,
"A number of other students also started to produce long lists but then realized that there was a simpler way. Samantha started to systematically go through all the natural numbers but instead recorded the ones that were relatively prime to 15. However, by the time she reached the mid 20s, she realized that there was a simpler way and returned to a computational method of counting multiples of 3, 5, and 15. Note that she kept 100 as part of her list; since 100 is a multiple of 5, it was removed in the subtraction step. She also divided 100 by 3 and ignored any fractional remainder, as she did when dividing 100 by 15. This issue of ignoring parts of sets and endpoints caused a number of difficulties for students when they worked on part (b). ",10,mtms2012-11-202a,,
"Other students were very precise about showing how they found multiples of 3, 5, and 15. They were also careful to adjust the endpoints so that they did not have to wonder if they should round up or round down when counting. Kayley’s work on parts (a) and (b) of the task was clear and organized (see fig. 3). She adjusted the endpoints to make sure that she was getting full sets of multiples of ",11,mtms2012-11-202a,,
"Fig. 2 Samantha counted up through the natural numbers, only recording numbers that were among those included in the set. Eventually, she found a pattern and  changed her approach to a computational one.",12,mtms2012-11-202a,,
"Fig. 3 Kayley used a purely computational approach to part (a), including correctly  accounting for the endpoints of the set of numbers.",13,mtms2012-11-202a,,
"3, 5, and 15 and also eliminated the question of rounding her quotients. To answer part (a), she changed the sets from 1–100 for dividing by 5 to 1–99 for dividing by 3 and 1–90 for dividing by 15.",14,mtms2012-11-202a,,
"She changed the endpoint of the interval to match the multiple of 3 or 15 that came just before 100, knowing that these sets would contain all the appropriate multiples. She did not leave fractional parts to worry about. This became particularly important in part (b). In figure 4 she changed the interval 43 to 274 when she worked with each factor. She first found all the multiples of 3, 5, and 15 from 1  to 274, then removed any multiples that occurred before 43, leaving her with those between 43 and 274. She was careful each time to adjust the endpoints to have whole-number quotients. Students who did not do this often produced rounding errors, and their final answers were incorrect. In fact, the most common answer to  part (b) was 124 because of miscounting associated with the endpoints or with rounding up when it was appropriate to truncate a quotient. ",15,mtms2012-11-202a,,
Part (c) of the task asked students  to communicate in writing the process they would follow to find the number of natural numbers relatively prime to ,16,mtms2012-11-202a,,
"Fig. 4 For part (b), as well, Kayley carefully accounted for the ends of the number range correctly.",17,mtms2012-11-202a,,
"Fig. 5 Although Kayley’s method yielded the correct answer for specific ranges of numbers, she struggled to describe her process in general terms.",18,mtms2012-11-202a,,
"Relatively prime means that the numbers do not share any factors other than 1. The factors of 15 are 1 & 15 and 3 & 5. To find the #s between any a & b that are relatively prime to 15 we need to find the #s that have these same factors or are multiples of 3, multiples of 5 or both (mult of 15). Once we find these #s that are not relatively prime to 15 we subtract the # of them from the total # of natural #s in the range to find the ones that are relatively prime (do not share any factors with 15).",19,mtms2012-11-202a,,
"15 between any two given numbers. This proved to be a challenge. The use of the variables a and b caused some students difficulties. Some students routinely used a – b and were not concerned about it resulting in a negative number. Others decided that b had to be the larger of the two and wrote the difference as b – a. Still others simply worked around the notation issues by stating in words that they would find the total numbers between a and b. Kayley’s description was an example of the latter (see fig. 5). Although her description lacked detail, exploring how she was going to find “the total # of natural #s,” her previous work showed that she knew how to do it appropriately but was having trouble describing the process in words. ",20,mtms2012-11-202a,,
"ReFlections on otheR student woRk This task provided some interesting points for discussion beyond those shown in these few examples. Many students who worked on part (b) of the task simply subtracted 43 from 274 to find 231, not realizing that they had removed the 43 by subtracting it, so 232 numbers were actually present. Others wanted “between” to mean “strictly between” and only counted the numbers from 44 to 273. ",21,mtms2012-11-202a,,
"Additionally, the endpoint issue  that was discussed briefly showed itself in many pieces of student work when they took the set of 232 numbers present and divided that number by 15: 232 ÷ 15 = 15R7. Students wanted to round this number down to 15 (or truncate it), explaining that 16 sets of 15 were not present. However, as Kayley’s work in part (b) clearly showed, there were 16 multiples of 15 between 43 and 274. The notion of counting sets of 15 consecutive numbers versus counting multiples of 15 was problematic. The technique that worked when starting a range of numbers at 1 must be adjusted when  starting at a number other than 1. Many students did not make that adjustment. ",22,mtms2012-11-202a,,
"Finally, most of our students had diffi culty explaining their work using precise terminology without losing important details. We worked on this regularly in class, but students’ longheld habits of informally communicating with one another seemed to get in the way when they tried to explain their mathematical processes and reasoning. NCTM’s Process Standards have explored the need for these skills since the fi rst Standards document, Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for School Mathematics, was published in 1989. The Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSI 2010) are also attempting to emphasize the importance of communication and precision in its new Standards of Mathematical Practice. It is something we all still need to work on, at every level of mathematics. ",23,mtms2012-11-202a,,
"ReFlections on the task The task elicits a number of misconceptions that students hold about counting numbers, subtraction, and the occurrence of multiples. However, these misconceptions could be dispelled if we would require students to explain their reasoning when working with each part, not simply part (c). Perhaps this would help students to be more precise and comprehensive in their descriptions in part (c), as well. Additionally, 15 was picked for a reason: It is the product of two relatively small prime numbers. You could use 6, 10, or 35 as well as any other product of two primes, and students would have to do the same type of reasoning. However, if the product is too large compared with the range of numbers, students will likely just physically write out the multiples.",24,mtms2012-11-202a,,
"It is important to realize that it would complicate the process considerably to use a number such as 60,  which has 3 prime factors. Counting the number of multiples of 2, 3, and 5 (the prime factors of 60) is not diffi cult, but students would then have to deal with how many times various numbers are being double-counted. For example, 30 is in all three sets, but 10 is in only two of them, and 15 is in a different two sets. Assigning this number will involve considerably more thought and a solid organizational scheme to accomplish the task. However, it may be a good challenge for a few of your most advanced students, and we know it would possibly challenge many of our preservice teachers.",25,mtms2012-11-202a,,
