The activity we describe awakened sixth gradersâ€™ understanding of how artists use mathematics. By exploring ratio and proportionality in different paintings, students realized the use of proportional reasoning in artistic compositions.",,
1,Using Artwork to Explore Proportional Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In this article, we share our lesson created for middle-grades students using a new game app called Keys to the Collection, developed by the Barnes Foundation in partnership with Drexel Universityâ€™s School of Education. This lesson was implemented in an urban sixth-grade class as well as during a sixth-grade field trip to the Barnes Foundation.",,
2,Using Artwork to Explore Proportional Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The catalyst for this activity was an ongoing partnership formed between mathematics educators and art educators at the Barnes Foundation in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. This partnership began with an email in which we asked the Barnes Foundation for access to diagrams used when the Barnes Foundation relocated from a suburban home to a large building in Philadelphia (Bush et al. 2013). Since that time, we have collaborated with art educators to develop field trip lessons and conduct workshops integrating mathematics with art in ways that align to the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSM) (CCSSI 2010).",,

4,Using Artwork to Explore Proportional Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The Barnes Foundation is an educational institution dedicated to teaching art in an integrated way. Originally established by Dr. Albert C. Barnes, a scientist, the Barnes Foundation houses a diverse art collection including impressionist, postimpressionist, early modern, and old master paintings. African sculpture, Pennsylvania German chests, Native American ceramics, jewelry, textiles, and metalwork are also represented. Barnes decided to display his collection by assembling works from different artists, periods, and geographic regions in wall groupings he called ensembles so that the viewer would compare the way artists composed their work using the same artistic elements.",,
5,Using Artwork to Explore Proportional Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"John Dewey, the well-known educator and philosopher, and Barnes collaborated on an educational method for interpreting art. Barnesâ€™s ultimate goal was to use his collection of artwork for educational purposes, focusing on artistsâ€™ use of color, light, line, and spaceâ€”all of which directly connect to mathematics through such concepts as proportionality and ratio. These ensemble displays provide an opportunity to look at how mathematics and art are integrated by exploring how artists use proportionality in creating the illusion of three dimensions on a two-dimensional canvas.",,
6,Using Artwork to Explore Proportional Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,ACTIVATING PRIOR KNOWLEDGE WITH WHOLE-CLASS DISCUSSION,,
7,Using Artwork to Explore Proportional Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Students were placed in study teams (groups of four) and given the following warm-up question,",,
8,Using Artwork to Explore Proportional Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,What ratio is formed when you compare the length of a large paper clip to the length of the eraser on your pencil?,,
9,Using Artwork to Explore Proportional Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Students immediately started by gathering a paper clip, their pencil, and a metric ruler. We asked students to use millimeters as their unit of measure because inches or centimeters would not have been precise enough to measure the artwork replications. We were surprised when some students were unsure which markings on their ruler represented millimeters. We used this opportunity to discuss the size of a millimeter and its relation to centimeters (1 cm = 10 mm). Even though we asked students to measure in millimeters, some initially offered solutions in inches. Solutions for the ratio of the length of the paper clip to the length of the eraser generated by the teams included the following ratios:",,

14,Using Artwork to Explore Proportional Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,31 mm : 11 mm,,
15,Using Artwork to Explore Proportional Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,29 mm : 5 mm,,
16,Using Artwork to Explore Proportional Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"When asked why solutions might vary, even within the same measurement unit, students agreed that it could be due to the length of the paper clip or eraser being measured. They also mentioned the possibility of measurement error.",,
17,Using Artwork to Explore Proportional Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Several interesting conversations emerged from the solutions that students proposed. First, students needed help with the idea that even if you measure using a different unit (e.g., inches or millimeters), the ratios are still equivalent. To address this, we asked, â€œDoes measuring using a different unit change your ratio?â€ Because all the work with the paper clip and eraser comparisons proved to produce small measures in fractional units for the inches, we decided to model this idea with their pencils. All the pencil sizes differed, but, for example, one pair of students measured 120 millimeters for the pencil and 5 millimeters for the eraser when measuring in metric units and then measured 6 inches for the pencil and 0.25 inches for the eraser, each time getting a ratio equivalent to 24:1. Student responses included the following:",,
18,Using Artwork to Explore Proportional Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Because this last student response was on the path to discovering that the ratios would remain equivalent, we asked students, â€œDoes a ratio represent an additive or a multiplicative relationship?â€ The class went back to the pencil example and agreed that it was multiplicative. One student said, â€œEven if you use different units of measure, they are proportional, which means a proportion of something in the same category that can be similar.â€ Another student made the connection to art class when he exclaimed, â€œWe did this in a drawing; we had to have the same proportion from our ear to our face as we made a self-portrait.â€ Every study team offered a solution that was in the form of a ratio (e.g., 31 mm : 11 mm). Using the student response of 24 mm : 6 mm as an example, we asked the class, â€œHow can you describe in words the relationship of the length of the paper clip to the length of the eraser?â€ One student responded, â€œFour multiplied by x,â€ with x representing the length of the eraser. We asked if the ratio could be written in an inverse way when comparing the length of the eraser to the length of the paper clip. Although at first they found the idea a little tricky, students discussed it in study teams and determined that the ratio could be described as",,
19,Using Artwork to Explore Proportional Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
20,Using Artwork to Explore Proportional Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Students concluded that a ratio could be written in two ways, as either multiplication or division, depending on how the question was posed.",,
21,Using Artwork to Explore Proportional Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,EXPLORING PROPORTIONAL REASONING THROUGH ART,,
22,Using Artwork to Explore Proportional Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Students were ready to be engaged in a meaningful task linking art and proportional reasoning. We shared information about our partnership with the Barnes Foundation and gave students a brief history of the foundation. Many students expressed a passion for art and were immediately excited about the activity. Each study team was given one of six selected color prints of paintings (see fig. 1aâ€“e; note: only five paintings are shown; a link in fig. 1f will take readers to Giorgio de Chiricoâ€™s The Arrival, which was also part of the class discussion) from the Barnes Foundation collection with the name of the artist and title of the painting on the back.",,
23,Using Artwork to Explore Proportional Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
24,Using Artwork to Explore Proportional Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The class shared two sets of the prints and passed them from group to group, meaning that groups were not working on the questions in the same order. Next, we gave each student an activity sheet, which asked two questions per painting: One question referred to the ratio between two objects in the painting, and the other question discussed an application that was designed to stretch studentsâ€™ thinking. This activity sheet contained several questions to challenge studentsâ€™ thinking about ratios and three-dimensional perspectives. It also asked about representations and relative sizes of objects and people. We projected presentation slides (see fig. 2) on the interactive whiteboard, with arrows to help direct students to the specific objects we were referring to in the questions.",,
25,Using Artwork to Explore Proportional Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
26,Using Artwork to Explore Proportional Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"For questions 1â€“12 on the activity sheet, students worked in study teams. Different teams approached the questions from different entry points, and overall solutions varied. Students engaged in meaningful mathematics discourse, justifying and explaining their reasoning, as well as working together with the shared reproductions. We will discuss questions 2 and 3 in detail to provide a sense of the discourse and learning that occurred as students worked to solve these contextual problems (see the activity sheet).",,
27,Using Artwork to Explore Proportional Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Study teams working on question 2 were at first perplexed by how they would estimate their own height in the painting (next to the horses and buggy) (see fig. 1a). We wanted students to struggle productively, as Principles to Actions recommends, so we knew to provide support in a way that kept â€œthe thinking and reasoning at a high levelâ€ (NCTM 2014, p. 49). We asked students guiding questions such as these:",,
28,Using Artwork to Explore Proportional Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Several study teams used the same general problem-solving plan. First, students determined that they had to measure themselves to get started and used rulers to measure one another (see fig. 3).",,
29,Using Artwork to Explore Proportional Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
30,Using Artwork to Explore Proportional Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"They measured themselves in centimeters and then multiplied by 10 to obtain their actual height in millimeters, which for one student was 1500 millimeters. Then measuring the horse and using what the study team members believed to be true about the approximate height of an actual horse, they agreed that the ratio of print to actual size was about",,

34,Using Artwork to Explore Proportional Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,to obtain their estimated height in the print of 37.5 millimeters.,,
35,Using Artwork to Explore Proportional Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Students working on question 3 were asked to determine the ratio of the heights of two women in the painting, one in the foreground and one in the background. One group began by measuring the height of each and then wrote a ratio to represent the comparison. Next, students determined that the ratio was 10 mm : 1 mm (see fig. 4).",,
36,Using Artwork to Explore Proportional Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
37,Using Artwork to Explore Proportional Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"To prompt one possible conversation with students, we asked what assumption was being made about the two women. We then guided students to the idea that the question assumed that the women had the same actual height, because if not, the ratio would not be representative of the actual height of both women.",,
38,Using Artwork to Explore Proportional Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Our favorite aspect of the activitysheet was the three culminating questions (13â€“15). We were impressed by the variety of studentsâ€™ ideas (see fig. 5) and the connections they made to real life, many of which were not previously mentioned.",,
39,Using Artwork to Explore Proportional Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
40,Using Artwork to Explore Proportional Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Notice that in some comments, students referred to the idea of proportion when they said that the artist â€œmakes distances really showâ€ by using the same ratio multiple times throughout the painting. Students noticed some big ideas about the art as well when they recognized a possible reason for circumventing the use of ratio. One stated, â€œAbstract artists might not use ratios because they donâ€™t want it [their painting] to be proportional.â€ Students were excited to discuss the links between mathematics and art with the whole class, and doing so gave us the perfect transition to the next part of our activityâ€”a closer look at Barnes Foundation artwork.",,
41,Using Artwork to Explore Proportional Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,EXTENDING THE ACTIVITY WITH AN APP,,
42,Using Artwork to Explore Proportional Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"As a culminating activity, we wanted students to further explore the collection of artwork at the Barnes Foundation and truly make this lesson an integrated experience with art. Because we could not take our students to Philadelphia, we introduced them to the free Keys to the Collection iPadÂ® app created for students ages 7â€“14. We downloaded this app on a classroom set of iPads ahead of class time. Class members were excited to see how pieces of artwork they had just worked with fit within the bigger picture at the Barnes Foundation. With their new awareness of the proportional reasoning needed by artists, students were ready to explore.",,
43,Using Artwork to Explore Proportional Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Students opened the app and chose to start a new game. After designing their own avatar, students were ready to enter three different Barnes Foundation gallery rooms found in the app (see fig. 6).",,

45,Using Artwork to Explore Proportional Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In each gallery room, students â€œjumpedâ€ into three different paintings. Our primary focus was on the first gallery room, in which students had to â€œrestoreâ€ paintings by informally fixing incorrect proportions and sizes of objects in the paintings. Students used visualization and informal proportional reasoning to estimate and then used their fingers to â€œpinchâ€ the figure on the screen to dilate it, which enlarged or shrank the object to restore the original artwork. Figure 7 shows a statue restoration, which students thought was especially interesting because they had previously worked with this painting.",,
46,Using Artwork to Explore Proportional Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
47,Using Artwork to Explore Proportional Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Students found this technology connection to be engaging and novel. It also helped deepen their own understanding of proportional thinking and how ratios link art to mathematics. The app has other connections to mathematics that could be easily highlighted. For example, students could explore concepts of probability, sample space, and the counting principle during the creation of their avatar.",,
48,Using Artwork to Explore Proportional Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,EXPLORING AN ON-SITE GALLERY,,
49,Using Artwork to Explore Proportional Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"A school group of sixth graders from Philadelphia had the opportunity to try this activity on-site in the actual gallery rooms at the Barnes Foundation. As an alternative to the lesson sequence described above, students instead began with an exploration using the Keys to the Collection game app to â€œrestoreâ€ paintings. Next, they used the activity sheet to engage in formalized thinking about ratios. With the paintings in front of them, students could see up close how artists like Jules Pascin, Giorgio de Chirico, and Henri Rousseau manipulated the size of objects using proportional reasoning to create a realistic sense of space. One student remarked, â€œI thought you just had to guess how big to make things in the background. I never realized that you could use math to figure that out.â€",,

51,Using Artwork to Explore Proportional Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"This activity offered a fun, meaningful exploration of the mathematics knowledge that an artist needs. It also tied in with CCSSMâ€™s sixth-grade and seventh-grade Ratios and Proportional Relationships domain and SMP 4. Students also dealt with measurement, conversions, and attending to precision in their work (SMP 6). The critical component of the entire process was the group discussion held after the activity sheet was complete. During this time, the teacher strategically selected students who had ideas related to the big mathematical concepts she wished to highlight and reinforce. In this way, various strategies were shared, and any misunderstandings were brought to the forefront and addressed. At the end of this important conversation, we asked students to reflect on what they had learned. Student responses included the following:",,
52,Using Artwork to Explore Proportional Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Students could authentically see the connections between art and mathematics. We hope that, as a result of reading about our work, other teachers are equally inspired to integrate art with mathematics, perhaps even using artwork from local museums or galleries to create new and exciting mathematical learning.",,
