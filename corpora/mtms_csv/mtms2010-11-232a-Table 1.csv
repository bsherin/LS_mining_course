"van HieleRevisited van Hiele wWhen you refl ect on assessment, do  useful information to both teachers and students” (italics added, NCTM 2000, p. 22). As we understand assessment, we think of it as contributing to all three questions above. It is a tool to be used in the classroom as a way to deepen students’ learning and to allow the educator to make informed decisions regarding instruction. The focus of this article will be on the role of assessment, both in terms of teachers and  you think about it as an evaluation of what a student knows?

"Authentic assessment allows students to demonstrate their acquired knowledge in a meaningful way and helps them continue to learn as they go through the process. Wiggins (1993) defines this term as assessments that are “engaging and worthy problems or questions of importance, in which students must use knowledge to fashion performances effectively and creatively” (p. 229). These assessments might  be projects completed at the end of a unit (summative assessment) or smaller activities peppered throughout the unit where the teacher is checking for understanding (formative assessment).

"The van Hiele model of the development of geometric thought was created in the 1980s by two Dutch middle school teachers and researchers, Dina van Hiele-Geldhof and Pierre van Hiele. The model described levels of understanding through which students progress in relation to geometry (Crowley 1987). The van Hieles outlined five levels that begin with the most basic level—visualization—and continue to the most advanced level— rigor (see table 1). ",5,mtms2010-11-232a,,
"The van Hieles (and subsequent  researchers) agreed that, unlike  Piagetian models, this is not a develop-  mental model where students must reach a certain age to progress through the levels; rather, it is dependent on the experiences and activities in which students are engaged (van Hiele 1999). In other words, students progress through levels on the basis of their experiences rather than age, and it is imperative that teachers provide experiences and tasks so that students can develop along this continuum.

"The van Hieles developed a framework for organizing classroom instruction to help teachers structure activities that cultivate their students’ geometric thinking (Clements 2003; Geddes 1992). This framework includes a sequence of five phases of learning:  information/inquiry, directed orientation, explication, free orientation, and integration (see table 2). The idea is that students need to cycle (and, for many, re-cycle) through phases of learning while developing their understanding at each level. We focus on the  last two phases, free orientation and integration, in this article.  •	 Free orientation is the phase in  which students are challenged to make connections among geometric concepts as well as solve problems related to them.  •	 Integration is the process whereby students reflect on their observations and how these observations fit into the overall structure of the concepts.

The CMP  curriculum materials use a variety  of formative assessments, such as end-of-investigation questions, checkpoints, notebook reflections, and a set of end-of-unit questions called Looking Back and Looking Ahead. ",60,mtms2010-11-232a,,
"In this particular unit, the Looking Back and Looking Ahead assessments include a set of questions that could provide both valuable feedback to a teacher about a students’ understanding and an experience that could help move students along the van Hiele model. ",61,mtms2010-11-232a,,
"One such question asks students to examine four statements to determine if they are true or false (see fig. 2).  The combination of the four separate statements is powerful in helping students think about what it means for figures to be similar. Asking students to consider similarity for both triangles and quadrilaterals and including one “true” and one “false” statement for each type of shape can help them think critically about the concept. In addition, figure 2’s statement 4d, unlike the previous three statements, requires that students consider the angles. ",62,mtms2010-11-232a,,
Let us look at the instance in  which Jerome answered statement 4b. Requiring him to justify his selection and include a written rationale engaged him in the integration phase of instruction. He responded in this way to the true or false question: “Any two rectangles are similar”: ,63,mtms2010-11-232a,,
"True, because all of the angles of rectangles are right so all of the angles  are congruent, and since the opposite sides of all rectangles are congruent their sides would be in proportion. ",64,mtms2010-11-232a,,
"As teachers, we might note that although Jerome knew that angles of corresponding figures must be congruent and sides must be in proportion, he clearly needed help in understanding what “sides must be in proportion” meant. Jerome also marked 4a and 4c as true, which raised a further question regarding his reasoning. These answers gave the teacher an opportunity to ask about his understanding, “Did he understand that similarity is a comparison of corresponding sides across two figures—or is he thinking within the figure?” When asked this question, Jerome clarified his understanding of the definition, which moved him along the levels.",65,mtms2010-11-232a,,
"Since Looking Back and Looking Ahead were intended to be formative assessment tools, teachers can use students’ responses to determine what is important to revisit with that particular student. In this case, students were solidifying their understanding of similarity as a definition and using the components of the definition (i.e., corresponding angles congruent, corresponding side lengths in proportion) to justify a generalized statement. This enhanced their deductivereasoning skills. ",66,mtms2010-11-232a,,
Summative Assessment with a  Free-Orientation-Phase Activity,67,mtms2010-11-232a,,
"Consider again that an eighth-grade teacher is helping his or her class   secure their notion of the importance of properties and the role of definition to develop logical reasoning. In this case, however, the context has changed and the class has completed a unit focused on the relationships among properties of shapes including angle sums. The activities included investigations of parallel lines with transversals and the angles, quadrilaterals, triangles, and tessellations that were created (see Geddes 1992 for sample activities). ",68,mtms2010-11-232a,,
"Summative authentic assessments provide insight into students’ understanding of the concepts from the unit. For example, figure 3 pre sents a series of questions to acquaint students with the use of a family-tree diagram (i.e., a flow chart), which shows relationships among concepts. After students have an understanding of how the family trees are used and what information is gleaned from them, a summative assessment could involve this fifth question (Geddes 1992, p. 54):   Try to build some other geometry family trees. For example: “The measure of an exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the two nonadjacent interior angles.” What are its ancestors?",69,mtms2010-11-232a,,
"One student who was given this task created figure 4, a family tree for the Pythagorean theorem. He saw two important aspects of the Pythagorean theorem, namely, the equation and the characteristics of the figure necessary to employ the formula. ",70,mtms2010-11-232a,,
"In this tree, he clearly identified that lines and angles make up polygons, that some polygons are right triangles, and that this will lead to having a hypotenuse in the figure. It is also interesting to note that he identified the property of substitution when using “equations” to solve the problem. Although it is not obvious in this figure, erasure marks below this pencil  fig. 3 This example of summative assessment explores what students can extrapolate from the activity at hand.",71,mtms2010-11-232a,,

"drawing indicated that several different trees were drawn and reconsidered. It is obvious that as the student participated in this assessment, he engaged in a variety of logical thought and was working toward the level of formal deduction. This family-tree structure helped students visualize connections, but it also forced them to consider the definitions of the words and how one implied another.  shaping instRuction",73,mtms2010-11-232a,,
"Teachers need to consider the outcome of authentic assessments when reflecting on and planning instruction. For example, after completing the aforementioned assessments, the teacher would consider the students’ level of progression through the van Hiele model. As the students achieve the informal deduction level, the teacher would begin to lay the foundation for those particular students to reach level 3: formal deduction. Since the students are able to see the interrelationships between figures, the teacher would give students the opportunity to discover a proof through activities and practice constructing proofs rather than memorizing them. ",74,mtms2010-11-232a,,
"Teachers must carefully monitor the progression of students through the van Hiele model and tailor instruction accordingly so that they receive the experiences necessary to move on. Consider Jerome, who completed the formative assessment in figure 2 about similarity. The teacher was left wondering about his full understanding of the true definition of the geometric term. Using the information from the assessment, the teacher prompted Jerome to justify his rationale, which in doing so moved him along the van Hiele levels because of the experience he had gained.",75,mtms2010-11-232a,,
