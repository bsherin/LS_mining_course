"How Old Is That Cactus? 2.  Assuming that Zandra is 5 feet,  5 inches tall, how tall in feet is  this saguaro? 3.  On average, these saguaros grow  1/2 inch the first year, up to 1 foot tall in the first 15 years, 10 feet tall by age 45, and 18 feet by age 100. Assume that this last growth rate continues until the saguaro’s death. Graph the height of a saguaro as a function of its age.  4.  Determine the average growth rate for each growth cycle of the saguaro. Complete rows 1−4 in the table. ",3,mtms2010-10-192a,,

Large cacti called saguaros (pronounced so-WAH-ros) have astounding growth rates and long life spans. Kelly took a picture of Zandra standing next to a saguaro. They then wondered about the height and the age of the cactus in the photograph. Use the following information to help them satisfy their curiosity.,15,mtms2010-10-192a,,

"Teacher notes: This activity provides a valuable opportunity to connect rate of change to slope. The solutions to 2 and 5 will depend on the answer to 1.  solUtions 1.  We used a strip of paper that is  the same length as Zandra’s height (in the picture) to determine how many Zandras would equal the height of the saguaro, which is  approximately 5 1/4.  2.  Zandra is 5 feet, 5 inches tall, or 65  inches. The saguaro is:  65 × 5.25 = 341.25 in. = 28.4375 ft.  3.    4.",18,mtms2010-10-192a,,
