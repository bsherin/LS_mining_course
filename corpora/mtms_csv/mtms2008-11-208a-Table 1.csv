This Standard proposes that prekindergarten through grade 12 instructional programs should enable students to “select, apply, and translate among mathematical representations to solve problems” (NCTM 2000, p. 67).

When the task progressed from computation to representation of the division problem, U.S. teachers fared even worse; only 1 of the U.S. teachers was able to construct a representation (verbal or visual) that was conceptually correct. Of the Chinese teachers, 90 percent were able to produce conceptually correct representations for this division problem. ",5,mtms2008-11-208a,,

the WorkshoP,7,mtms2008-11-208a,,
"This article describes the challenges that one group of teachers faced in representing division problems. The problems were encountered at a Teacher Leader Academy produced by the Math Science Partnership of southwestern Pennsylvania, a National Science  Foundation-funded program to improve the teaching of mathematics and science at the K−12 grade levels. This weeklong workshop focused on helping elementary school and middle school teachers deepen their understanding of the four arithmetical operations. ",8,mtms2008-11-208a,,
"The Teacher Leader Academies are  organized by mathematics coordinators from the Allegheny Intermediate Unit (an educational resource facility that serves elementary and secondary schools in the Pittsburgh region). The coordinators spend most of the year collecting and developing high-quality workshop material from a variety of sources. During the summer months, they meet with teacher leaders at area colleges and universities and prepare them to plan and produce teacher professional development programs in their own districts. University faculty are also involved in this process as planners and workshop facilitators. The mathematics coordinators  selected material for one session from Numbers and Operations: Making Meaning for Operations (Part 2) of the Developing Mathematical Ideas series by Dale Seymour Publications (Schifter, Russell, and Bastable 1999).",9,mtms2008-11-208a,,
The Elastic Stretch Problem,10,mtms2008-11-208a,,
"On the last day of the workshop, the participants considered a case study that posed this problem: ",11,mtms2008-11-208a,,
"A piece of elastic can be stretched to 5 1/2 times its original length. When fully stretched, it is 33 meters long. What was the elastic’s original length? (Schifter, Russell, and Bastable 1999, chap. 7)",12,mtms2008-11-208a,,

Fig. 3 An alternate visualization of stretched elastic,15,mtms2008-11-208a,,
"A student in the case study described his group’s solution by drawing 33 rectangles and stating that they wanted to put the rectangles into  5 1/2 groups. However, the group produced a diagram that showed the 33 meters divided into 6 parts (see  fig. 1), not 5 1/2 parts (Schifter,  Russell, and Bastable 1999, chap. 7).",16,mtms2008-11-208a,,
"How did the students in the case  study ﬁnd the ﬁrst diagram? The consensus in our workshop was that the students realized that the Elastic Stretch problem is solved by the division problem 33 ÷ 5 1/2. They represented this associated division problem without connecting it to the context of the original problem. After extensive discussion and more student work, another group of students in the case study produced the diagram in figure 2 (Schifter, Russell, and Bastable 1999, chap. 7) that shows  5 1/2 groups of 6 meters each. ",17,mtms2008-11-208a,,
"The answer to the stretch problem is that the elastic originally measured 6 meters. The students in the case study, as well as the participants in the Teacher Leader Academy, agreed that the second ﬁgure is a better representation of the Elastic Stretch problem because it shows 33 meters partitioned into 6 meters 5 1/2 times. Figure 1 shows 6 groups, not 6 meters. ",18,mtms2008-11-208a,,
"Then one of the participants, Sallie ",19,mtms2008-11-208a,,
"Peck, spoke up, “What if the 6 parts of the ﬁrst picture each represent  1 meter of the original elastic that has been stretched to 5 1/2 meters?” Peck drew 6 squares above the ﬁrst picture and connected them to the original diagram (see fig. 3), showing a before and after situation. Understanding student errors is an important skill for assessing student work. In this case, Peck had to use a similar skill to understand student work that was possibly correct. ",20,mtms2008-11-208a,,
"Researchers typically classify multiplication and division problems into four classes. The two most common classes are called equal groups and multiplicative comparison problems (Cathart et al. 2003; Van de Walle 2004). These classiﬁcations are called sharing/measurement and ratio quotient in Rubenstein, Beckmann, and Thompson (2004). The students in the case study agreed on an equal groups interpretation of the problem, in which the entire 33 meters of stretched elastic are partitioned into 5 1/2 equal groups of 6 meters of unstretched elastic. The students later demonstrated that they interpreted the Elastic Stretch task as a measurement problem (also in the equal groups class of problems) by subtracting  5 1/2 six times from 33: 33 5",21,mtms2008-11-208a,,
"Peck was able to see the situation  as being a multiplicative comparison problem. Van de Walle describes this as follows: “There are really two different sets, . . . one set consists of multiple copies of the other” (2004, p. 144). In the Stretched Elastic problem the two sets are (1) the number of meters of unstretched elastic and (2) the number of meters of stretched elastic. Each meter of unstretched elastic corresponds to 5 1/2 meters of stretched elastic.",22,mtms2008-11-208a,,
"Classifying the multiple interpretations for the students is usually not the teacher’s goal. It is crucial, however, that the classroom teacher recognizes that they are valid strategies and that he or she must be ﬂexible when facilitating alternate approaches. Peck’s solution showed that unexpected alternate strategies are sometimes valid—with some work. It is essential that teachers encourage their students to go beyond computation. Students and teachers alike must be able to explain the mathematics and express the situation with symbols, charts, ",23,mtms2008-11-208a,,
"Teachers realized the importance of being able to conceptually represent the mathematics so that they can guide their students to create and understand alternative representations graphs, and diagrams, which are all ways of communicating mathematically. Creating these representations and interpreting the representations of others require that students make connections. “Students who are more comfortable when performing operations than they are when reasoning fail to make connections and are unable to transfer information to new situations, even when the transfer represents only a small step” (NCTM 2000).  “Moving from one representation to another is an important way to add understanding to an idea. As teachers help develop ﬂexibility with a variety of representations for mathematical ideas, students not only add to their own understanding but also acquire skill in applying mathematical ideas to new areas and communicating ideas to others” (Van de Walle 2004, p. 5). When students can create and identify corresponding representations, their understanding of relationships will be extended (Chapin and Johnson 2000). We cannot adequately develop this ﬂexibility in our students if we have not acquired it ourselves.",24,mtms2008-11-208a,,
The Cottage Cheese and  Lawn Mower Problems,25,mtms2008-11-208a,,
The facilitator of the workshop shared these follow-up questions  with participants.,26,mtms2008-11-208a,,
"1.  I eat 2/3 cup of cottage cheese for lunch each day. I have 2 2/3 cups of cottage cheese in my refrigerator. How long will that last me? 2.  I put 2 2/3 gallons of gas into my empty lawn mower. I notice that it is now 2/3 ﬁlled. What is the capacity of my gas tank? (Schifter, Russell, and Bastable 1999, p. 69) ",27,mtms2008-11-208a,,
"Earlier in this article, a question of representation for the division problem 2 2/3 ÷  was posed. Was your representation anything like these situations? 2/3",28,mtms2008-11-208a,,
The following description allows us to classify these representations: ,29,mtms2008-11-208a,,
"When the number and size of groups are known, the problem is a multiplication situation. When either the number of sets or the size of sets is unknown, division results. But note that these latter two situations are not alike. Problems where the size of the sets is unknown are called fairsharing or partition problems.",30,mtms2008-11-208a,,
"The whole is shared or distributed among a known number of sets to determine the size of each. If the number of sets is unknown but the size of the equal sets is known, the problems  are called measurement or sometimes repeated-subtraction problems. The whole is “measured off ” in sets of the given size. (Van de Walle 2004, p. 144)",31,mtms2008-11-208a,,
"The Cottage Cheese task is a  repeated-subtraction, or measurement, problem, because we must determine the number of days that we consume 2/3 cups of cottage cheese. The Lawn Mower task is harder to classify, but we can make a case that it is a fairsharing, or partition, problem. The ",32,mtms2008-11-208a,,

The facilitator asked the participants to ﬁnd a multiplication sentence and a division sentence for each problem and to model each sentence with a diagram or manipulatives. The workshop participants had no trouble agreeing on a suitable representation for the ﬁrst problem (and perhaps the reader will pause to construct her or his own model before continuing on). The second problem turned out to be much more difﬁcult.,35,mtms2008-11-208a,,
"Because the problem was challeng- ing, the discussion became intense. The participants were not able to agree on any sort of visualization of either the multiplication 4 × 2/3 = 2 2/3 or the division 2 2/3 ÷ 2/3 = 4 that would accurately represent the context of the problem. This problem was much more difﬁcult than anticipated. The facilitator drew two representations for the Lawn Mower problem on the board. The ﬁrst representation shows a 3 × 4 rectangle composed of blue and orange squares (see fig. 4). One teacher quickly explained that if each square represents 1/3 gallon of gasoline, then the orange squares total 2 2/3 gallons of gasoline arranged in columns, where 2/3 of each column is “ﬁlled” with gasoline. Since there are 4 columns, the capacity of the gas tank must be 4 gallons. The blue squares in the top row each represent 1/3 of each gallon of empty space (or air), which completes the full gas tank.",36,mtms2008-11-208a,,

"The second representation shows  two rows of blocks (see fig. 5). The bottom row is made of 1 × 3 orange blocks, speciﬁcally, 2 2/3 of them. The top row is made of four 1 × 2 blue blocks aligned directly over the bottom row. The teachers agreed that this ﬁgure clearly represented the problem 2 2/3 ÷ 2/3 = 4, since the total of 2 2/3 is measured by four blue blocks representing 2/3 of each orange box.",39,mtms2008-11-208a,,
"The participants ran into a problem when the facilitator asked them to connect the diagram with the context of the Lawn Mower problem. They did not think this was possible. Their objection was that if each orange  1 × 3 rectangle represents 3/3 gallons of gas, then how could each smaller blue rectangle also represent a gallon? Peck resolved the confusion by ",40,mtms2008-11-208a,,
"Fig. 6 Visualizing the gas tank interpreting the second problem as a rate problem. Since the gas tank is 2/3 full, each 2/3 of a gallon of gas that was put into the tank corresponds to 1 gallon of capacity. She drew table 1, which shows how each blue rectangle could simultaneously represent 2/3 gallon of gas and correspond to a full gallon of tank capacity. ",41,mtms2008-11-208a,,
"To present additional insight,  the facilitator added a row of orange blocks, so that a full gas tank was represented by six squares to the gallon; 2/3 of each gallon, shown in orange, is ﬁlled with gasoline. This is demonstrated by outlining four groups of six squares, as in figure 6. This shows that the gas tank is 2/3 full and 1/3 empty and has a capacity of 4 gallons, each of which is outlined in black. The gas tank contains 2 2/3 gallons of gas, shown in orange.

"The participants agreed that by  creating, interpreting, and discussing the various representations, they now had a better understanding of fraction division. They realized the importance of teachers being able to conceptually represent the mathematics so that they can guide their students to create and understand alternative representations. Each teacher was conﬁdent that  the activities greatly enhanced their ability to help their students develop ﬂexibility with representations, and, ultimately, deepen their understanding of mathematics.",43,mtms2008-11-208a,,
