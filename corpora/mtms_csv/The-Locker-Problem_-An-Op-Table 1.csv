0,The Locker Problem_ An Open and Shut Case - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Mathematics educators have argued that the mathematical tasks that teachers use greatly influence their students thinking; these tasks then determine what students learn. For example, Lappan and Briars (1995) argued that there is no decision teachers make that has a greater impact on students opportunities to learn and on their perceptions about what mathematics is than the selection or creation of the tasks with which the teacher engages students (p. 138). The success of teaching through problem solving hinges on not only the selection of a task but also how the task is implemented to maintain high cognitive demand (Stein and Smith 1998) and bring out the embedded mathematics.",,
1,The Locker Problem_ An Open and Shut Case - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The widespread adoption of the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSM) (CCSSI 2010) has created a platform for the development of more rigorous, focused, and coherent mathematics curricula, instruction, and assessments. These key shifts in the curriculum target deeper conceptual understanding and reasoning, as well as the development of procedural fluency. In particular, within CCSSM are eight Standards for Mathematical Practice (SMPs) that describe varieties of expertise that mathematics educators at all levels should seek to develop in their students (CCSSI 2010, p. 6). Among the SMPs are expectations that students be adept in the selection and use of appropriate tools for solving problems and be able to persevere in solving problems using multiple representations. Furthermore, students are expected to verbally explain and defend their own approaches as well as understand and critique the reasoning of others.",,

For example, a teacher might pose purposeful questions to facilitate meaningful mathematical discourse about connections among multiple representations of a concept.",,
12,The Locker Problem_ An Open and Shut Case - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In our classes, we enact these Teaching Practices with prospective elementary teachers through the lens of teaching via problem solving. The importance of problem-solving skills cannot be overstated. In Principles and Standards for School Mathematics, NCTM (2000) argues that instructional programs from prekindergarten through grade 12 should develop all students problem-solving skills. Researchers (e.g., Schroeder and Lester 1989) have identified a variety of approaches for including problem solving in school curricula. In this article, we discuss how we use teaching via problem solving to help us enact the Teaching Practices and support our students learning and development of the Standards for Mathematical Practice. This approach involves selecting and implementing mathematical tasks that serve as vehicles for meeting the learning goals for the lesson. For the lesson discussed here, the learning goals are developing our students understanding of number theory concepts (factors; multiples; greatest common factor, or GCF; and least common multiple, or LCM). Further, we seek to continue a yearlong goal of developing our students problem-solving skills.",,

When recess is over, each student walks into the school one at a time. The first student opens the first 100 locker doors. The second student closes all the locker doors with even numbers. The third student changes all the locker doors (change means either closing an open door or opening a closed door) with numbers that are multiples of three. The fourth student changes the lockers that are multiples of four, the fifth student changes the lockers that are multiples of five, and so on.",,

We have found the problem to be both accessible and challenging for students. It also yields a productive conversation among students about strategies that work best. While students work on the problem, our role as instructors is to facilitate their explorations and offer guidance without giving the solution.

Some groups begin by writing an array of the first 100 natural numbers, to represent the lockers, and attempt to simulate the problem by marking the lockers as closed or open as they send students through the imagined hallway. Some groups use manipulatives (e.g., colored counters or number cards) to model the problem. Students quickly realize that trying to look at all 100 lockers is overwhelming and that they need to refine their strategies. We use several pedagogical moves to support students productive struggle, such as questioning, refocusing their investigation, and encouraging collaboration.",,

27,The Locker Problem_ An Open and Shut Case - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"While students work on the problem, we walk around the room and assist their problem solving. Our assistance includes listening to and observing the students to determine their struggles and offering guidance through questioning. We also use questioning to challenge students who have solved the problem to extend their reasoning and make sense of the embedded mathematical ideas. Typical questions include the following:",,
28,The Locker Problem_ An Open and Shut Case - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,1. What strategies have you tried so far?,,

34,The Locker Problem_ An Open and Shut Case - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,We determine appropriate questions depending on a groups progress.,,
35,The Locker Problem_ An Open and Shut Case - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Students use our questioning and their experience in problem solving to refine their strategies. For example, students may try to solve a simpler problem and look for patterns that emerge. Some may continue their approach of using colored counters or number cards, but refine it by keeping a record of the open lockers after the nth student has gone through, producing a list that they can explore for patterns.",,
36,The Locker Problem_ An Open and Shut Case - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Anticipating students responses also helps guide our questioning. For example, some of our students observe that after the second student has gone through, one-half of the lockers are closed. This prompts students to focus on determining how many lockers are open after the nth student has gone through them. We know that this is not a productive strategy, so we ask questions to redirect students efforts, such as keeping track of the elements of the set of open lockers as opposed to the sets cardinality. If students are not already doing so, we encourage them to start exploring patterns in lockers that they have already identified as open (e.g., 1, 4, 9).",,
37,The Locker Problem_ An Open and Shut Case - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Appropriate questioning enables us to maintain high cognitive demand throughout the problem-solving process. It also enables us to elicit evidence of the students thinking about the problem and adjust our pedagogy to meet instructional goals. By this time in the semester, students have adapted to the culture in our classes in which ideas are challenged and others reasoning is made sense of and critiqued. The problem-solving environment, coupled with purposeful questioning, creates an environment in which meaningful struggle is not only encouraged but also supported for all students.",,
38,The Locker Problem_ An Open and Shut Case - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,USE AND CONNECT MATHEMATICAL REPRESENTATIONS,,
39,The Locker Problem_ An Open and Shut Case - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"There is broad agreement among mathematics educators that individuals should be able to solve mathematical tasks not only quickly and accurately, but also adaptively, i.e., individuals should acquire the ability to solve mathematical tasks flexibly by a diversity of meaningfully acquired strategies and representations, taking into account the subject, task and/or context characteristics (Heinze, Star, and Verschaffel 2009, p. 535). We advocate the use of multiple representations to capture learners interests and promote conditions for effective learning (Ainsworth 1999), and because students construct knowledge in individualized experiential ways.",,
40,The Locker Problem_ An Open and Shut Case - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"After the students have worked on the problem for a while, we engage them in a whole-class discussion to elicit multiple solution strategies and ways of looking at the problem.

42,The Locker Problem_ An Open and Shut Case - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"When we assign the Locker problem, we encourage students to select and use any appropriate tools to model the problem. Integer chips and numbered cards are two manipulatives that students have chosen. Groups that have used integer chips lay them out to signify a subset of the lockers. After assigning one color to represent an open locker and another color to represent a closed locker, students then simulate the experiment (see fig. 1).",,
43,The Locker Problem_ An Open and Shut Case - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
44,The Locker Problem_ An Open and Shut Case - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Successful students using this approach need to be very organized because it is easy to lose track of counting using unlabeled chips. We encourage students to look for patterns in their model. When these students present their work to the whole class, we typically ask, How did your work help you solve the problem? Our question is meant to prompt students who did not use this approach to appreciate differences between their approach and this one.",,
45,The Locker Problem_ An Open and Shut Case - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Groups that model the problem with numbered cards represent each locker with a number and turn the card facedown if the locker is closed and faceup if it is open. Usually we have students who use the numbered-cards approach present their findings after the integer chips presentation because we believe that the latter builds on the former. Figure 2a and 2b show a typical progression of this approach.,,
46,The Locker Problem_ An Open and Shut Case - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
47,The Locker Problem_ An Open and Shut Case - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Groups using manipulatives to solve the problem have often leveraged their simulation to argue for one or sometimes both of these patterns:,,
48,The Locker Problem_ An Open and Shut Case - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"1. Focus on closed lockers: OCCOCCCCOCCCCCCO. . . . These students have tended to focus on the closed lockers and identify the arithmetic sequence (2, 4, 6, . . . ) in the number of closed lockers between open lockers.",,
49,The Locker Problem_ An Open and Shut Case - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,2 Focus on open lockers:,,
50,The Locker Problem_ An Open and Shut Case - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,OCCOCCCCOCCCCCCO. . . . These students have tended to focus on the successive differences of open lockers (see table 1).,,
51,The Locker Problem_ An Open and Shut Case - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
52,The Locker Problem_ An Open and Shut Case - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Successful students using numbered cards are more likely to identify either (or both) of these patterns than students using integer chips, who tend to identify the closed lockers pattern.",,
53,The Locker Problem_ An Open and Shut Case - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Some students were able to recognize that the open lockers are perfect squares. We typically have different preselected groups use their cards to discuss the patterns they see. The perfect squares pattern is more powerful than differences between open lockers because there is an explicit rule (P(n) = n2) in play: The nth open locker is locker number n2. The other two rules are inductive in the sense that one needs to know the previous open locker to determine the next open locker. For instance, using the pattern of closed lockers, there are 2n closed lockers between the nth open locker and the next open locker",,
54,The Locker Problem_ An Open and Shut Case - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"(i.e., Pn = Pn-1 + 2(n  1) + 1, P1 = 1).",,
55,The Locker Problem_ An Open and Shut Case - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"So if one knows that 16 is the fourth open locker, the closed lockers pattern tells us that the next 8 lockers are closed and that the 5th open locker is 25, derived from 16 + 2(4) + 1. We believe the differences in the representations (what is highlighted and what is masked) are important to discuss. Our questioning helps students make sense of the fundamental difference between the explicit and the inductive rules of the patterns. For example, we ask both the groups using the explicit and inductive patterns to explain to the whole class how they would use their pattern to determine the 10th open locker. This helps make the point that with an inductive rule you need to know the 9th open locker to find the 10th locker.",,
56,The Locker Problem_ An Open and Shut Case - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Tracking,,
57,The Locker Problem_ An Open and Shut Case - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Some groups have used one of two tracking strategies, rather than manipulatives, to represent the situation.",,
58,The Locker Problem_ An Open and Shut Case - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"1. Tracking students: This approach follows each of the first n students and determines what the student does to each locker, making changes on a list showing the lockers, and finding patterns (see fig. 3).",,
59,The Locker Problem_ An Open and Shut Case - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
60,The Locker Problem_ An Open and Shut Case - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,2. Tracking lockers: This approach involves asking What students are going to touch this locker? and using that information to determine the status of the locker after 100 students have gone through them (see fig. 4).,,
61,The Locker Problem_ An Open and Shut Case - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
62,The Locker Problem_ An Open and Shut Case - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Students using tracking often gravitate to the first approach, which is slower and often messier. However, we like to discuss both approaches because they are fundamentally different. The tracking-students approach involves picking a number and following its multiples, whereas the tracking-lockers strategy requires picking a number and finding its factors. We are deliberate about discussing these tracking approaches last because they help us transition toward exploring the mathematics embedded in the task.",,
63,The Locker Problem_ An Open and Shut Case - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"One difference between these tracking approaches that emerges during students presentations is that groups tracking students often observe that the first locker that student k touches is locker k (see rows of fig. 3), whereas those who track lockers readily observe that the student n is the last student to touch locker n (see fig. 4). For the latter, this means that the status of locker n does not change after student n has gone through the lockers. Although students do not readily recognize the differences between these two approaches and this recognition is not necessary to solve the problem, the difference has implications for the mathematics embedded in the task. Through the whole-class discussion, we have been able to create opportunities for students to make sense of and critique the reasoning of others. In addition, this situation creates a shared experience of perceiving the problem from multiple approaches, which we believe to be important before moving onto exploring the mathematics embedded in the task. For example, after students using the tracking approach on figure 4 present their work and observations, students using the tracking approach on figure 3 observe that the diagonal of figure 3 highlights that the last student to touch locker n is student n. This is a good opportunity to make a connection between these representations.",,
64,The Locker Problem_ An Open and Shut Case - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,FACILITATE MEANINGFUL MATHEMATICAL DISCOURSE,,
65,The Locker Problem_ An Open and Shut Case - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"After the presentations, we transition from finding a solution to exploring the mathematical ideas embedded in the problem (factors, multiples, GCF, and LCM) (CCSSI 2010, 4.OA.4 and 6.NS.4). Questioning helps us transition smoothly:",,
66,The Locker Problem_ An Open and Shut Case - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Which students will touch a particular locker?,,
67,The Locker Problem_ An Open and Shut Case - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,How many students will touch a particular locker?,,
68,The Locker Problem_ An Open and Shut Case - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,What does this problem tell us about characterizing natural numbers according to the number of factors they have?,,
69,The Locker Problem_ An Open and Shut Case - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,These questions are meant to prompt the students to discover that each locker is only touched by students whose number labels are factors of the locker number.,,
70,The Locker Problem_ An Open and Shut Case - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Further, we aim to have students discover patterns in the number of factors that a number has, in general. We ask students to compare the number of factors of an open locker (e.g., factors of 16 are 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16) with those of a closed locker (e.g., factors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12). Through questioning, we are able to scaffold students investigations and guide them to establish not only that each locker is only touched by the students whose number label is a factor of the locker but also that open lockers are touched an odd number of times. If students are struggling to see why perfect squares have an odd number of factors, we encourage them to list factor pairs of a perfect square. For example, (1, 16), (2, 8), and (4, 4) are the pairs for 16; hence, 16 has five distinct factors. In comparison, the factor pairs of 12 are (1, 12), (2, 6), and (3, 4); thus, 12 has six distinct factors. Developing this understanding provides students with a foundation for a concept in their mathematical horizoncharacterizing natural numbers according to the number of factors they have.",,
71,The Locker Problem_ An Open and Shut Case - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,BUILD PROCEDURAL FLUENCY FROM CONCEPTUAL UNDERSTANDING,,
72,The Locker Problem_ An Open and Shut Case - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,We are also able to leverage students work to develop their conceptual understanding of the concepts of LCM and GCF. Asking such questions as (a) Who is the last student to touch both lockers 45 and 60? and (b) What is the first locker that both students 10 and 12 will touch? enables us to drive home the need to understand the concepts of LCM and GCF. The first question is a GCF question in which students are challenged to reason with common factors.,,
73,The Locker Problem_ An Open and Shut Case - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"By using students work, the class can compare the factors of 45 to those of 60 to establish that the GCF of (45, 60) is 15. Similarly, students can use their results to compare multiples of 10 and 12 to establish that the LCM of (10, 12) is 60. We believe that leveraging students work and encouraging an exploration of these concepts via problem solving brings meaning to the concepts and allows students to create a strong bond between their conceptual understanding of the concepts and the procedures for finding LCM and GCF.",,

75,The Locker Problem_ An Open and Shut Case - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We have discussed how we enact the Teaching Practices found in Principles to Actions in our classes by selecting a rich mathematical task and using it to develop students learning of important mathematical concepts. For us, teaching via problem solving has been how we interpret the Teaching Practices and the Standards for Mathematical Practice. Engaging students in problem solving as a vehicle for learning mathematics allows them to sharpen their problem-solving skills, especially while looking for patterns, and has created opportunities for our students to understand and critique the reasoning of others.
