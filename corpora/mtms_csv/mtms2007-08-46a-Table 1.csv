Similarly, students may be told that subtraction always corresponds to walking backward; for positive integers, they should face right before walking and for negative integers they should face left before walking. In discussing traditional textbook approaches such as the number-line model or the charged-particle model, Petrella (2001) notes that “student reactions to these lessons characteristically conveyed a sense of confusion, consternation, and frustration” (p. 150) and that the models “did not enhance the learning environment. On the contrary, the model itself was a distraction” (p. 150).",1,mtms2007-08-46a,,
"Although other models, involving such items as thermometers, pebbles in a bag, and helium balloons, may be more realistic for students, their connection to integer operations is still  tThe National Research Council  (2001) notes that a variety of metaphors have been used to introduce negative numbers in school, “including elevators, thermometers, debts and assets, losses and gains, hot air balloons, postman stories, pebbles in a bag, and directed arrows on a number line” (p. 245). In addition, standard textbooks have typically employed either a chip model, where positive integers are represented by black chips and negative integers by red chips; a charged-field model, showing +/–; or a number-line model. Some contexts or models are not really metaphors because, for example, negative numbers do occur in temperatures, in accounting, and in some sports scoring (e.g., scores under par in golf ). However, these contexts become  metaphorical when they are used to model arithmetical operations with integers. Each model or context must construct a scenario that makes it plausible to explain, for instance, why subtracting an integer is the same as adding its opposite or why a negative times a negative is a positive.",2,mtms2007-08-46a,,
"In some situations, establishing the connection between the model and the way that integer operations work results in a proliferation of rules within the model that can be just as devoid of meaning for students as the abstract mathematical rules. Although the metaphorical connection may be obvious to teachers, it may not be obvious to students who are just learning about operations with integers. For example, in the number-line model, students may be told that the ",3,mtms2007-08-46a,,

"contrived. For instance, in the balloon model (Reeves and Webb 2004), subtracting a negative integer corresponds to releasing a balloon that has a negative value assigned to it. It is nearly impossible to avoid the contrived nature of these metaphors. The rules for calculating with integers are deduced from the properties of integers. The rules for calculating with helium balloons cannot be similarly deduced. Given this dilemma, the best that we can do is to try to develop contexts for thinking about integer operations that do not confuse our students and may help them construct an informal way to think about why the operations work. That is what we offer here.",5,mtms2007-08-46a,,

"Textbooks using the chip model or the debit-credit model employ a topdown approach in which they simply tell students how to interpret integer number sentences in terms of the model. Instead, we wanted to develop a bottom-up instructional sequence  that would first provide students with learning opportunities to construct integers as composite units. In other words, we want students to be able to represent any given integer in a variety of ways, such as representing –5 as  –5 + 0, –4 + –1, –3 + –2, and so on. We also want them to be able to recreate –5 in any way that would be useful for the specific task by adding equal positive and negative quantities to –5. For example, given the problem  –5 − +12 = ____, students can consider how –5 might be expressed as –5 + 12 + –12. This would represent –5 in such a way that +12 could be “taken away” from it. We believe that as students develop this flexibility in representing integer quantities, they are developing a basis for building an understanding of operations on integers.",7,mtms2007-08-46a,,
"To help students make sense of operations on integers using a bottom-up approach, we initially used a  game context from the “Operations” unit of the Mathematics in Context (MiC) series (Abels et al. 1998). This unit is intended to support students’ thinking about quantity and operations on integers. The game scenario describes a class in which students play a game. Teams that answer a question correctly receive a point, which is represented by a +1 chip. Teams that answer incorrectly lose a point, which is represented by a –1 chip. The game scenario is used to provide a context for developing a chip-model-type interpretation of operations on integers. In using this game scenario with our college developmental-level students (whose mathematical understanding is at approximately a seventh- or eighthgrade level), we found that although the scenario did provide a realistic context for some students, most were not engaged in the scenario and did not use it to reason about operations or for constructing integers as composite units. Thus, we tweaked the scenario by changing the chip model from a  record of points in a game to a record of debits and credits. Our introduction to this modified scenario follows.",8,mtms2007-08-46a,,

Imagining that debits and credits may be added or taken away based on whether or not a task was performed proved to be realistic for our university students. Many of our students are parents who struggle with getting their own children to do household tasks. It was also realistic for a class of eighth graders that we worked with who were horrified to think that failing to do a chore would result in a debt that would have to be paid.,18,mtms2007-08-46a,,
"When discussing their reasoning about the tasks in figure 1, students realized that by pairing debits and credits they really only needed to look at what they called “the leftovers” on each board to determine the net earnings. They argued that the remaining chips canceled out, or “zeroed out,” each other. This was an initial step in their construction of an integer as a composite unit. The students were then able to apply a canceling-out strategy to solve the tasks in figure 2. For example, in figure 2a, students typically began by placing 3 negatives on the board to cancel out the 3 positives, thus bringing the board’s value to 0. Then they added 6 more negatives. A few students applied a more abstract strategy to this task by reasoning that “since 6 plus 3 is 9, there must be 9 negatives.” However, they had difficulty articulating why this strategy worked. To help them, the teacher asked them to think about how their strategy related to that of the students who actually drew the credits and debits on the board. Finally, note that –6 was used as the board value in all the tasks in figure 2. The rationale was to support the idea that an integer such as –6 could be  represented in a variety of ways (e.g., 3 positives and 9 negatives, 6 positives and 12 negatives, and so on).",19,mtms2007-08-46a,,
"To further develop the idea of an  integer being a composite unit, we moved to tasks in which students were asked to figure out the net amount represented on a board after a debit or credit was added or taken away (see fig. 3a). The tasks became increasingly difficult as students were asked to remove credits or debits that were hidden. To introduce the idea of hidden debits and credits, the teacher placed a debit-credit board on the overhead projector with, say, 6 negatives showing and a collection of paired debits and credits hidden under a piece of cardboard (see fig. 3b). By moving the cardboard back and forth to reveal some of the paired debits and credits, the teacher reviewed the idea that a given integer could be represented in a variety of ways. No matter how many paired debits and credits were revealed, the value of the board remained the same. Students were encouraged to apply the notion of uncovering paired debits and credits to solve tasks such as that in figure 3c. In essence, students had to represent an integer quantity as a composite that would enable them to remove the debit or credit. For example, to solve the task in figure 3c, some students modified the board by uncovering 5 credits and 5 debits so that they could remove 5 credits. Other students uncovered only 3 credits and 3 debits because the existing 2 credits meant that they would have enough to remove 5 credits. We followed these tasks by asking students to write number sentences to represent each problem situation (e.g., +2 − +5 = –3).",20,mtms2007-08-46a,,

"Students consistently reasoned  correctly that removing debt meant that Cindy had indeed cleaned the refrigerator. More important, they correctly reasoned that removing a $12 debit would increase Cindy’s allowance by $12. Discussing tasks of this type led to students being able to formulate the generalization that subtracting a number is the same as adding its opposite.",41,mtms2007-08-46a,,
"We concluded our work on adding  and subtracting integers by posing number sentences and asking students to recast the sentences in terms of the debit-credit context so that they might be easier to solve. For example, students might contextualize the number sentence –3 − –5 = ____ in the following way: “The net value of Cindy’s board was –3. She did the laundry, and her mom told her to take off 5 debits. What was the new value of her board?”",42,mtms2007-08-46a,,
"Finally, we extended the scenario  to multiplication of integers in a way that was compatible with that suggested by the National Research Council (2001). Drawing on the notion of multiplication as repeated addition, we suggested that if Bobby failed to do three chores, each worth $4, then we could express this as –4 + –4 + –4 = –12, or 3 × –4 = –12. Then we asked students to vote on what they thought about –3 × –4. Students  were evenly divided among believing that –3 × –4 “equals 12,” “equals –12,” or “can’t be done.” We find the “can’t be done” answer to be quite interesting. (Historically, broad acceptance of the possibility of multiplying two negative numbers did not occur among mathematicians in Europe until the nineteenth century.) It is difficult to find a realistic situation that serves as an informal justification for why –3 × –4 = 12. With other models for integer multiplication, we found ourselves shifting into a telling mode, rather than an inquiry mode. However, while working with eighth graders, state standards and standardized tests gave us an impetus for posing the issue of multiplying two negative numbers. We considered this idea in the context of problems such as the following. ",43,mtms2007-08-46a,,
Mrs. Brady noticed that Cindy had done the dishes three nights in a row so she told her to remove three $4 debits from her board. How did the value of her board change? ,44,mtms2007-08-46a,,
"In discussing this problem, we asked students to consider that if 3 × –4 is “adding three $4 debits” (adding –12), then –3 × –4 might be interpreted as “removing three $4 debits” (taking away –12), which results in an increase of $12 to net profit. By extending the allowance-chore model in a realistic way to encompass multiplication of integers, this model may seem less contrived than other typically used models. As a result, the allowance-chore model permits the teacher to remain in an inquiry mode.",45,mtms2007-08-46a,,

"Although the debit-credit model is well known, we believe that the instructional sequence based on the allowance context described here improves the model. We also think that it has three primary advantages over many models that have been used to explain the rules for operating on integers:  1. The allowance context engaged  a greater number of students than did the MiC game context. Perhaps the rules for acting in this context fit with their intuitions and prior experiences so that it was real for them. In any case, when we switched to this context, we found more students drawing on the context to interpret simple integer number sentences, such as 4 − –7.  2. We designed a sequence of  activities that built on one another to help students construct the notion of an integer as a composite unit. The construction of this concept was supported by the allowance context and, in turn, supported the students’ efforts to use the context to give meaning to arithmetical computation with integers.  3. In the spirit of the NCTM’s ",47,mtms2007-08-46a,,
"Standards (2000), our bottom-up approach to implementing the sequence meant that we did not tell students  how to use the context to solve integer number sentences. Instead, we posed problems in context and allowed students to solve them in ways that made sense. The context served to support their thinking rather than require them to memorize another list of rules. This meant that different solutions to a task such as 4 – –7 were possible. For instance, some students used the debit-credit board to represent 4 as 4 + 7 + –7 so that –7 could be taken away, whereas other students used the relationship they had constructed between subtracting an integer and adding its opposite to solve the task by computing 4 + 7. Thus, we believe this context was meaningful for students without being prescriptive; it supported them in developing the ability to reason about integer computations instead of simply being told how to reason.
