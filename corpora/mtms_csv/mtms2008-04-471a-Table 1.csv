"Amy Scheuermann and Delinda van Garderen cCentral to the saying that “A picture  is worth a thousand words” is the notion that it can harbor a wealth of information. A picture or, specifically, a graphic representation, such as a diagram, table, or chart, can contain much information about what a student understands and can do in mathematics. That said, how often do we carefully examine the graphic representations our students generate when doing mathematics?",2,mtms2008-04-471a,,
"A major requisite in mathematics  is that all students develop “representational fluency,” that is, that they know about representations, including graphic representations, and can use  that knowledge appropriately to solve problems (NCTM 2000). Unfortunately, many students struggle with or never develop representational fluency (van Garderen and Montague 2003). As a result, they are at risk for failure in mathematics, particularly because representational fluency is a necessary skill for obtaining mathematical understanding (NCTM 2000). ",3,mtms2008-04-471a,,
Educators are challenged to provide effective and efficient mathematics instruction specific to our students’ strengths and weaknesses. One step toward ensuring quality instruction is by determining what misconceptions students have and what error patterns ,4,mtms2008-04-471a,,
"Amy Scheuermann, ascheue@bgsu.edu, is an assistant professor in the School of Intervention Services at Bowling Green State University, Bowling Green, OH 43403. She is interested in the methods used to teach mathematics to students with disabilities  as well as those at risk in mathematics. Delinda van Garderen, vangarderend@ missouri.edu, is an assistant professor in the Department of Special Education at the University of Missouri—Columbia, Columbia, MO 65203. She is interested in students with disabilities and their use of representations to solve word problems.  they make when solving problems (Ashlock 2006). That information can then be used to guide instruction. Although analyzing students’ computation for errors produces valuable information, this article will demonstrate that analyzing their graphic representations is equally important. We contend that the examination of their graphic representations (hereafter referred to as representations) can provide invaluable information to help focus instruction and move students toward representational fluency.

"Any representation that a student generates when solving a mathematics problem can potentially be used for assessment. However, representational forms containing schematic qualities have been found to relate to higher levels of performance (Brown and Presmeg 1993; Hegarty and Kozhevnikov 1999). Knowing that some representations are more helpful than others, we need to determine the degree to which the student can generate a representation that can be used as a tool to successfully solve mathematics problems (Pape and Tchoshanov 2001). To do this, three key questions should be asked:  1.  Does the representation relate to  the problem?  2.  If so, what type of representation  was generated?  3.  How complete is the representation? ",7,mtms2008-04-471a,,
"Because a student-generated representation may have no relevance to the problem, the first decision that needs to be made is whether it relates in any way to the mathematics problem. (For examples of nonrelevant representations, see fig. 1.) Nonrelevant representations can be examined for other types of errors (e.g., poor reading level) or misconceptions about representation (e.g., does not understand the purpose of a representation). In addition, a one-on-one interview with the student can provide additional clarity, if needed. ",8,mtms2008-04-471a,,
"If the representation does, even in some small way, relate to the problem, the next question asked is what type of representation was generated. Although various categorization schemes for representations exist (i.e., Presmeg 1986a), the scheme we use categorizes representations as either primarily pictorial or primarily schematic. This categorization approach comes from the work of Hegarty and Kozhevnikov (1999). A pictorial representation  depicts images of the objects and/or people to illustrate the key components of the problem. In contrast, a schematic representation goes beyond this to portray the spatial relationships among the elements of the problem by demonstrating how they belong together. Examples of pictorial and schematic representations can be found in figure 2. ",9,mtms2008-04-471a,,
"After deciding whether the representation generated was pictorial or schematic, the next step is determining how complete it is. A complete pictorial representation depicts every component of the problem. See, for example, the first representation in figure 6. If the representation was schematic, in addition to depicting all the components, a complete representation would also accurately depict all the relationships among the various components. For an example, see the third representation in figure 6. To help analyze students’ representations, we have developed the Graphic Representation Assessment Process shown in figure 3. To understand how to use this assessment process, the case studies of Susan and Michael are presented on the following pages as illustrations.

"Case Study 1: Susan Susan, a thirteen-year-old with a mathematics learning disability, finds mathematics in general to be a difficult and frustrating subject area. According to her standardized mathematics assessment scores, she is three years behind her peers. She has received extra support in mathematics for many years but still needs intense instruction. Her special education teacher, Ms. Porter, wants to help Susan improve her problem- solving skills but is unsure exactly what to focus on. To help her narrow her instructional focus, she asked Susan to solve three word problems. Following completion of the problems, Ms. Porter examined the representations that Susan generated as she tried to solve them. (See fig. 4 for Susan’s representations.)",47,mtms2008-04-471a,,
"For the first problem, Susan did  not generate any representation, so Ms. Porter recorded the lack of representation on a scoring sheet (see fig. 5). For the next two problems, ",48,mtms2008-04-471a,,

"Susan did generate a representation, which to some degree related to the corresponding problem. For the first representation, Ms. Porter needed to determine if it was primarily pictorial or primarily schematic. She decided it was pictorial, since it only depicted an image of an item in the problem, and no relationships were drawn. Next, Ms. Porter examined the drawing for its completeness. She noticed that several components were missing. For this reason, on the scoring sheet she marked problem 2 as being an incomplete pictorial representation. For the third problem, Ms. Porter once again determined that the representation was pictorial, as it depicted objects from the problem, but it did not portray how those objects belonged together so she recorded it as an incomplete pictorial representation. Using the information gathered from Susan’s representations, Ms. Porter drew the following conclusions: (1) Susan does not always generate a representation when solving problems, and (2) when  she does, the majority are pictorial and lack key components. ",54,mtms2008-04-471a,,
"From this information, Ms. Porter  identified several ways to focus her instruction. First, Susan needs instruction on understanding what a representation is and how it can be used to help solve problems, since it appears she may have little understanding of the purpose or benefits of using representations. Second, Ms. Porter decided to build on Susan’s current pictorial abilities to teach her how to identify and represent key components of a problem, because Susan’s incomplete pictorial representations suggest she may be struggling. Finally, Ms. Porter acknowledged that identifying and representing key relationships will need to be addressed in the future so that Susan can become effective at using representations to help her solve problems.

"Case Study 2: Michael Michael is fourteen years old and also has a mathematics learning disability. He has never liked or enjoyed mathematics, which is evident by his standardized mathematics test scores showing that he is at least two years behind his peers. Currently, Michael is in a full inclusion classroom for mathematics with Mr. Wright. He has been working with the class on developing and using representations to solve word problems. To assess Michael’s progress and focus future instruction, Mr. Wright decided to examine some of his recent representations (see fig. 6).",100,mtms2008-04-471a,,
"First, he observed that all of Michael’s representations were relevant to the problems, which he recorded with delight on the scoring sheet (see fig. 7). Next, he analyzed each representation to identify the type. For the first problem, he found evidence of a pictorial representation but no  evidence of relationships to indicate a schematic representation. He then examined the individual components to see if Michael’s representation was a complete or incomplete pictorial representation. He noted that Michael had included all the components, making his representation complete. Moving on to the second problem, Mr. Wright saw that most of the components were represented except the people but that specific relationships were also depicted. These illustrations of relationships from the problem caused him to decide the representation was primarily schematic. Because Michael did not represent all the relationships, Mr. Wright marked it as incomplete. On the final problem, Michael clearly depicted all the relationships from the problem, making it a complete schematic representation. As Mr. Wright examined the scoring sheet, he drew two conclusions: (1) Michael understood what representations were  and how to use them, and (2) although Michael could depict accurate representations of the relationships in the problems, he was not consistently identifying or depicting all the relationships.

"Mr. Wright concluded that his  instruction on the use of representations to express and represent key components and relationships in word problems had been effective. Michael was clearly creating complete pictorial representations and was beginning to depict accurate schematic representations. He noted, however, a need to shift the instruction from representing only the components and relationships to also identifying the critical relationships found within the problem.

"The ability to use representations is integral to learning mathematics. However, the assessment of studentgenerated representations has too often been overlooked (Dufour- Janvier, Bednarz, and Belanger 1987). However, a representation can only be useful to the extent that it has been “grasped” by the student (Dufour- Janvier, Bednarz, and Belanger 1987, p. 116). If a student struggles in mathematics, one area that should be assessed is a student’s ability to generate and use representations. We recommend that this assessment include determining the relevancy as well as the quality (by this we mean type) and completeness of the representation. Although the Graphic Representation Assessment Process previously outlined can assess a student’s problemsolving ability as it relates to graphic representations, this picture is incomplete. This assessment only focuses on a product (i.e., graphic representation). It may be beneficial to evaluate when, where, and how a student uses representations while solving a problem. This may be done by observing when (e.g., before, during, or after finding the solution) and how (e.g., to set up the problem, to work the problem out, as a tool to express their thinking) representations are used to solve the problem by the student.
