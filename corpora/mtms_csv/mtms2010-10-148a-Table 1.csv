A nonroutine  fraction problem provides many solution paths. ,2,mtms2010-10-148a,,
"Kristie J. Newton students, despite our best efforts to help them understand why a procedure works. Unfortunately, even knowing why something works does not ensure that you will always know when the procedure is appropriate. That when will arrive with procedural ﬂ uency.  j“Just tell me how to get the answer!” Many of us have heard this plea from our  “knowledge of procedures, knowledge of when and how to use them appropriately, and skill in performing them ﬂ exibly, accurately, and effi ciently” (NRC 2001, p. 121). The problem discussed in this article has been surprisingly diffi cult for some groups to solve, despite the rather fundamental ideas involved. These diffi culties underscore the importance of procedural ﬂ uency. Before continuing, I urge the reader to solve the problem. If the solution comes easily, try solving it a second way.",3,mtms2010-10-148a,,

The Mathematical Preparation  of Chocolate Milk,5,mtms2010-10-148a,,
"Jenny was mixing herself a glass of chocolate milk. “You certainly have enough chocolate syrup in the glass,” remarked Kevin, who then found a glass of milk of his own to drink.  “Only a third of a glass of syrup,” said Jenny. “And you’re certainly taking your share.”  “I only have one-fourth of a  glass,” estimated Kevin.",6,mtms2010-10-148a,,
"“But Kevin, your glass holds  twice as much!” “Tell you what,” said Kevin, after they both had mixed milk and syrup in their glasses. “Let’s combine our drinks in a larger pitcher, and then split the whole amount.”",7,mtms2010-10-148a,,
"While Jenny is trying to decide whether or not this  arrangement is to her advantage, can you say what part of the  combined mixture would be syrup? Use pictures, numbers, or words to show your solution strategy.",8,mtms2010-10-148a,,
(Note: By “her advantage” we mean the sweetest chocolate milk.),9,mtms2010-10-148a,,
"This problem intrigued me because  solving it can be challenging, even though the computation is not difficult. The problem was presented to preservice teachers at the end of a semester-long mathematics course designed to help them understand why algorithms in the elementary school curriculum work the way they do. Despite increased knowledge of fraction concepts and procedures, as well as an ability to solve routine word problems, the success rate on this nonroutine problem was surprisingly low. In one study, only 6 out of 85  preservice teachers at the elementary level correctly solved the problem (Newton 2008). ",10,mtms2010-10-148a,,
"I have given this problem to many  people—students, teachers, pre- service teachers, mathematics educators, mathematicians, and engineers— over the past several years so I could try to understand the various approaches that people use to solve it. There are many paths to take; the solutions shared here are collectively the most common ones I have seen. Incorrect responses have also been quite predictable. What these responses might indicate about the understanding of the content is suggested.",11,mtms2010-10-148a,,
"The problem was adapted from an old book of puzzles (Linn 1969) and has been used for professional development and methods courses, among others. Although it is an interesting problem for secondary students, I have most frequently used it on the first day of a methods course as a way to introduce significant pedagogical ideas. These pedagogical ideas will also be shared.  solUtion Methods",12,mtms2010-10-148a,,
"The successful solution methods can be characterized four ways. The first two methods rely on a deep understanding of two basic yet critical concepts related to fractions—equal parts and equal units. According to Yoshida and Sawano (2002), these concepts often remain implicit elements of fraction instruction; it is taken for granted that students understand them well as they work to solve problems involving fractions. The researchers assert that the two concepts should receive much more explicit attention in the classroom. In their study, students who received such instruction were better able to apply fraction concepts and procedures to novel situations. ",13,mtms2010-10-148a,,
"A third solution strategy, called the  numerical approach, involves making  the problem more concrete by asking: “How much milk does Jenny’s glass hold?” Some students do have a sense that it does not matter how much the glass holds, so they choose a number that makes the calculations easy. This approach is also the type provided in the back of the puzzle book (Linn 1969).",14,mtms2010-10-148a,,
"The fourth approach is more formal and involves algebra. By choosing a variable to represent the amount of chocolate milk in Jenny’s glass, some simple algebraic equations can be set up and solved. ",15,mtms2010-10-148a,,
The Equal-Parts Approach,16,mtms2010-10-148a,,
"The problem can be solved using  only diagrams if the concept of equal parts is applied. In other words, the denominator of a fraction represents the total number of same-sized parts in a unit. To determine what part of the combined chocolate-milk mixture is syrup, it is necessary for each of the parts to be equivalent. This is accomplished in figure 1 by partitioning the various containers. Once all parts are equivalent, it becomes apparent that the combined mixture consists of 5 parts syrup and 18 total parts. Hence, 5/18 of the combined mixture is syrup.",17,mtms2010-10-148a,,
The Equal-Units Approach,18,mtms2010-10-148a,,
"The problem can be solved using the traditional algorithm for fraction addition if the concept of equal units is applied. In other words, fractions cannot be added together unless they refer to the same unit, or whole. If they do not refer the same unit, it is necessary to rename the fractional parts so that their units are the same. The unit in this case is the pitcher.",19,mtms2010-10-148a,,
"One way to solve the problem is to describe the syrup in terms of the pitcher that will hold the combined mixture. In particular, figure 2 shows that Jenny’s glass is 1/3 of the volume of the pitcher and her syrup is 1/9 ",20,mtms2010-10-148a,,
"Fig. 1 The equal-parts approach is demonstrated by partitioning the total amount of chocolate milk into 18 parts, 6 of which are from Jenny’s glass and 12 are from Kevin’s. ",21,mtms2010-10-148a,,
"Fig. 2 The equal-units approach is demonstrated by expressing quantities as parts of the same whole, which in this case is the pitcher containing the mixture of the two glasses of chocolate milk.",22,mtms2010-10-148a,,
Fig. 3 The numeric approach involves assigning consistent and speciﬁ c numbers to the problem and can lead to a discussion of ratio and proportion.,23,mtms2010-10-148a,,
"of the pitcher. Kevin’s glass is 2/3 of the volume of the pitcher, and his syrup is 1/6 of the pitcher. Once the fractional parts are described in terms of the same unit (i.e., the pitcher), the fractions can be added by fi nding a common denominator. Specifi cally, + = 18 18 18",24,mtms2010-10-148a,,
The Numerical Approach,25,mtms2010-10-148a,,
"Some students solve the problem by choosing numerical values to represent the amount held by each glass. For example, if Jenny’s glass holds 12 ounces, then Kevin’s glass would hold 24 ounces, and the combined mixture would be 36 ounces. These choices mean that Jenny has 4 ounces of syrup, Kevin has 6 ounces of syrup, and the combined mixture has 10 ounces of syrup. Hence, the combined mixture is 10/36, or 5/18, syrup (see fi g. 3). ",26,mtms2010-10-148a,,
"Note that this approach also lends  itself to a discussion of ratios and their properties. In particular, students might notice that this approach is different from fraction addition because the amount of syrup in each glass is being added as well as the amount of chocolate milk. One explanation is that two units are being combined to create a larger unit (i.e., the combined mixture of chocolate milk), as opposed to parts of a single unit being combined. A similar argument can be made for the equal-parts approach, but here the use of symbols to represent the fractional amounts may make the difference more apparent than when using diagrams only.",27,mtms2010-10-148a,,
The Algebraic Approach,28,mtms2010-10-148a,,
"This approach has been quite commonly used among the algebra teachers, mathematics educators, and mathematicians I have surveyed. In the last step, the variables cancel, suggesting that the relationship would hold for any amount. ",29,mtms2010-10-148a,,
Let j represent the amount of ,30,mtms2010-10-148a,,
"Jenny’s chocolate milk. Then 2j would represent the amount of Kevin’s chocolate milk, and 3j would be the amount of chocolate milk in the combined mixture. The total amount of syrup can be found by adding the parts in terms of Jenny’s glass and  then simplifying the result. In other words, since Kevin’s amount can be represented as 2j, then 1/3 of Jenny’s milk plus 1/4 of Kevin’s milk can be written symbolically and simplifi ed to be +j )2 j2( j2 j2 j .",31,mtms2010-10-148a,,
"Fig. 4 One common mistake that students make is using an incorrect “common unit.” As shown below, the incorrect unit is the size of either Jenny’s or Kevin’s glass.",32,mtms2010-10-148a,,
   Jenny’s glass as “one whole”  (a)   (b),33,mtms2010-10-148a,,
Kevin’s glass as “one whole”,34,mtms2010-10-148a,,
"Using common denominators, j+ j+ +j j === 5 j.",35,mtms2010-10-148a,,
"Finally, the ratio of syrup to chocolate milk in the combined mixture is",36,mtms2010-10-148a,,
"Another common response is  incorrect in part because it is incomplete. Some students recognize the need to fi nd a common unit, but they do not seem to be clear about which unit is appropriate. These students know that if you “pour” Kevin’s syrup into Jenny’s glass, it will fi ll 1/2 of it. Add that to Jenny’s 1/3, and you have 5/6 of her glass fi lled with syrup (see fi g. 4a). In other words,",37,mtms2010-10-148a,,
"After canceling the variables, the remaining expression is equivalent to + =+ = ×5 or or 18 18 18 tYPical eRRoRs",38,mtms2010-10-148a,,
"One common error is to add the named fractional parts without accounting for the fact that they are fractional parts of different units. Specifi cally, some students answer the question with + =+ = 12 even after drawing an appropriate image of the two glasses (i.e., one being twice as large as the other). In this case, students do not seem to understand that you cannot add fractions using the traditional algorithm unless they refer to the same unit. ",39,mtms2010-10-148a,,
"Of course, Jenny’s glass is not the appropriate unit; instead, it should be the pitcher that holds the combined mixture. Knowing this fact, the problem can be correctly completed with one extra step. Namely, × =× =×× =× 1 18",40,mtms2010-10-148a,,
"This multiplication problem makes sense because the total syrup is 5/6 of Jenny’s glass, but her glass holds only 1/3 of the combined mixture, and 5/6 of 1/3 can be found by multiplying 5/6 and 1/3. ",41,mtms2010-10-148a,,
"A related, but somewhat less  common, error occurs when Jenny’s syrup and Kevin’s syrup are combined in Kevin’s glass, fi lling 1/6 + 1/4 = 5/12 of it with syrup, as shown in  fi gure 4b. Again, one extra step would provide the correct solution. Specifi cally, multiplying 5/12 by 2/3. In this case, Kevin’s glass is 5/12 full of syrup, but it represents only 2/3 of the combined mixture, and 5/12 of 2/3 can be found with the calculation 12 × =× = 10 36 or or 18 18 18",42,mtms2010-10-148a,,
Pedagogical iMPlications,43,mtms2010-10-148a,,
"I have often used this problem on the fi rst day of a mathematics methods course for preservice teachers at the elementary and middle school levels because it seems to naturally lend itself to a discussion of several important pedagogical issues. Once students solve the problem and we discuss the various approaches, I highlight some of the ideas that emerged from their work on the problem. By making these ideas explicit, I hope to lay the foundation for future discussions within the course. ",44,mtms2010-10-148a,,
"First, the problem does a nice  job of illustrating the importance of conceptual understanding. In this case, knowing how to add fractions with different denominators is not enough to correctly solve this problem; students must also know when it is appropriate to do so and how to create the appropriate circumstances. In particular, the traditional algorithm for adding fractions (i.e., the common denominator method) requires that the fractions refer to the same unit; if not, they must be renamed in terms of the same unit before adding them. ",45,mtms2010-10-148a,,
"Alternatively, the fractional  amounts can be partitioned such that all the parts are the same, as is done with the equal parts and numerical approaches. After discussing various solutions, the students can acknowledge that the problem does not require a high level of mathematical knowledge to solve it—just a deep level.",46,mtms2010-10-148a,,
"Discussing solution strategies almost inevitably leads to some  “A ha!” moments or some “Why didn’t I think of that?” reactions, particularly after someone explains the numerical approach. Even for students who correctly solved the problem a different way, making the problem more concrete helps them to make sense of the solution in a way that their future students might also benefit from. In other words, the discourse involved in sharing and justifying strategies benefits more than just the person doing the sharing; it allows other students to deepen their understanding of the underlying mathematics. ",47,mtms2010-10-148a,,
"The problem also makes the social nature of doing math apparent. Even when I do not suggest that students work together to solve the problem, they typically begin to talk about the problem with those around them. For some students, it is only in collaboration with others that they are able to solve it. Their natural tendency to talk with others about a math problem that is difficult to solve alone helps make the distinction between seating students in groups and having students work together within their groups.",48,mtms2010-10-148a,,
"While students are working on   the problem, I am able to model the types of questioning that can be used to scaffold students’ thinking. For example, if a student claims the answer is 5/6, I might respond with these questions:  •	 How	did	you	arrive	at	5/6?	 •	 What	does	5/6	represent	in	this	 case?  •	 Is	Jenny’s	glass	large	enough	to	 hold the final mixture?  •	 How	large	must	the	container	be	 to hold the final mixture?  •	 What	part	of	the	final	mixture	is	",49,mtms2010-10-148a,,
Jenny’s chocolate milk?  •	 How	can	you	use	this	information to find what part of the final mixture is syrup? ,50,mtms2010-10-148a,,
"By asking questions, I am able to guide students to the solution rather than telling them how to solve the problem correctly. ",51,mtms2010-10-148a,,
"The problem can help students see the value in learning (and discussing) more than one way to solve a problem. In this case, seeing the problem solved in multiple ways helps illuminate some of the underlying mathematical ideas that make the problem challenging. It also promotes flexibility. For students who solve the problem easily, asking them to solve it a second way can have a similar benefit.",52,mtms2010-10-148a,,
"Because the problem is non-  routine, it can become an informal assessment of how well students truly understand some routine algorithms. Its multiple entry points (e.g.,  diagrams, algebra) suggest that it can be used with students of diverse mathematical backgrounds. This  allows teachers to get a broader sense of the students’ thinking with regard to rational numbers. For example, students who give 5/6 as their solution seem to understand that fractions cannot be added unless they refer to the same unit, but they do not seem to understand which unit is appropriate for this problem.",53,mtms2010-10-148a,,
"Finally, estimation can be used to help decide if an answer is correct.  One student was able to figure that Jenny’s glass was 1/3 of the final mixture and that all the syrup would fit into (but not fill) her glass. He concluded that the final mixture must be slightly less than 1/3 syrup. ",54,mtms2010-10-148a,,
"Such approaches have not been  common, but this kind of reasoning might be a helpful way to begin the problem. If students are able to conclude that the final mixture will be less than 1/3 syrup, they should be able to also conclude that answers such as 5/6 are incorrect.",55,mtms2010-10-148a,,
conclUsions,56,mtms2010-10-148a,,
"Using a nonroutine problem can be an effective way to encourage students to draw on prior knowledge, work together, and reach important conclusions about the mathematics they are learning. In the case of the chocolate milk problem, the importance of equal parts and equal units are highlighted as students discuss possible solution methods. Hearing alternative approaches to the problem serves to further illuminate how critical these ideas are, for example, in understanding the why and when of fraction addition. These understandings, in turn, can help illuminate why knowing how is not always enough.",57,mtms2010-10-148a,,
