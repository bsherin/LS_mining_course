"Engaging all students in grade-level mathematics is often a challenge for teachers, especially in diverse urban classrooms. Too often in my role of supporting the development of effective practices with middle school teachers, I observe traditional classroom instructors presenting information and demonstrating procedures. In this typical setting, students watch the teacher work hard, but they are not necessarily engaged or able to understand the material. We need to transition to classrooms where students ",1,mtms2010-08-42a,,

"Anne M. Collins one teacher’s story geneously grouped. When he first asked students to make a list of problem-solving strategies that they could use for any problem situation, he was dismayed to discover that the students either could not identify a strategy or could only guess an operation that might apply to the problem. ",3,mtms2010-08-42a,,
He decided to focus on solution  strategies in every class meeting until the students demonstrated proficiency in the problem-solving process. He began by arranging his classes into small groups and asking each group  to identify various ways that they could attack any problem they had not previously seen. ,4,mtms2010-08-42a,,
"With some prompting, the students listed many of the strategies that George Polyá, often called the “father of problem solving,” identified. When students omitted graphing as a strategy, Adam added it to the list and explained that a graph provides a visual representation that he finds useful. He posted the list of strategies in a prominent location in the classroom and referred to it   work hard building understanding and where the teacher, who continues to work hard, assumes different roles. The middle school math teacher should be a coach, mentor, and facilitator, not a purveyor of information. Adam, one teacher with whom I have worked, has adopted these roles in his classroom.",5,mtms2010-08-42a,,

"Adam spent much of the class  time in the following weeks assigning nonroutine problems and asking students to identify the problem-solving strategies that could be used to find solutions. He also required students to show or identify the strategy they selected until they demonstrated confidence and competence in gaining entry into any problem or task he assigned. After this work, Adam decided that the students were ready to tackle more complex, real-world problems whose solutions required applying several strategies and allowing for multiple representations.",13,mtms2010-08-42a,,

"Most middle school teachers recognize that students invest a lot of energy in activities that interest them. Unfortunately, teachers often hear these questions asked in math class: “Why do we have to do these problems?” and “When will we ever use this?” Adam decided that a problem about phone plans would provide a context that would be of interest to all.

(b) understanding on the basis of the representations they used. ,24,mtms2010-08-42a,,
"Because Adam was concerned  about the computational skills of some of his eighth-grade students, he created two versions of the problem (see fig. 2). Since using friendly numbers is a strategy that Adam employs with his students when they engage in mental math, he offered an alternate version of the phone problem using this strategy. Adam’s adaptation did not modify the main mathematical focus, so every student worked on grade-level mathematics and had a fair chance of preparing for the learning standards found in the eighth-grade state assessment (MADOE 2000). With alternative versions available, the entire class could discuss the problem, its different representations, and the solution.",25,mtms2010-08-42a,,
The inclusion of multiple representations in student work indicates a deep understanding of the math involved. I had introduced Adam and his colleagues to a multiple-representation graphic organizer that consists of the following five types:  1.  Tables 2.  Graphs 3.  Algebraic equations 4.  Calculators 5.  Communication ,26,mtms2010-08-42a,,
"The graphic organizer was designed to prompt students to think about the relationships among numeric, geometric, and algebraic representations, which would then support inference and calculation (Greeno and Hall 1997). It also enabled all students, regardless of their learning strengths, to gain entry into a given problem. For students who did not have access to a graphing calculator, a noncalculator version of this organizer was also available. ",27,mtms2010-08-42a,,
"The underlying premise for including sections for multiple representations on the same graphic organizer is that it sends a subtle message that the representations are related to one another. When students make connections, comparisons, and selections among these forms of representation, they are engaged in algebraic reasoning.",28,mtms2010-08-42a,,
"As teachers become familiar with this specific graphic organizer, I find they sometimes adapt it to fit particular learning objectives or problems. Adam was such a teacher. He was interested in his students’ computational skills, so he ruled out using graphing calculators in favor of allowing a general graphic organizer that had space for a graph and table only. Reflecting on what to include in the graphic organizer helped Adam further specify his learning objectives and his assessment. His graphic organizer, along with available scrap paper, would serve as his students’ response forms. ",29,mtms2010-08-42a,,
"To further clarify the instructional  and assessment goals, Adam developed an analytic rubric for the problem (see fig. 3). Each student received the rubric with the problem, helping to ensure that they could determine what would demonstrate success. As multiple representations are a focal point for Adam, he made this expectation explicit in the rubric. ",30,mtms2010-08-42a,,

With the students fully engaged, Adam introduced the specific problems and told them that they were allowed to choose the version. They were then allowed to discuss solution strategies with a partner who made the same problem choice. However, students were required to work on their solutions independently, so that Adam could assess an individual’s ability to represent and solve the problem. He used the student work to help plan his follow-up lessons.",34,mtms2010-08-42a,,
"using ProBing Questions to checK understanding Adam used each assigned problem as a way to formatively assess his students’ learning. While his students were working, he observed what they were doing and listened to what they were   saying, although he tried not to hover. He walked around the room to observe how individual students attempted a problem, and he made notes on the clipboard he now carries with him during each class. He often found it necessary to formulate an appropriate question to either clarify a misunderstanding or refocus the student’s attention on the problem at hand. ",35,mtms2010-08-42a,,
Three types of questions could be asked of students (Bright and Joyner 2005):  1.  Engaging 2.  Clarifying 3.  Refocusing ,36,mtms2010-08-42a,,

Asking the right question at the right time is crucial. ",38,mtms2010-08-42a,,
"As Adam discovered, correct questioning is hard work. It takes time to realize just what question to ask and when to ask it. He admits that this is a work in progress but emphasizes that he is learning more about how students think in mathematics than when he would tell them what was incorrect or how to proceed. When planning lessons, he tries to anticipate the misunderstandings that might arise and frames questions that might address those misconceptions in class.  exaMining student WorK The examples shown are representative of the work that Adam received from his students. Adam noted that they chose the version that was appropriate to their individual computational level. ",39,mtms2010-08-42a,,
Guess and Check and  Exemplar Justifications,40,mtms2010-08-42a,,
"Student A used two separate tables to show the cost of a Zune, given the price of an iPhone (see fig. 4). The use of the tables helped the student access the guess-and-check strategy. Note also that the included calculations show two of the guesses that the student made, complete with computations to illustrate one incorrect and one correct guess. The calculations give insight into how the student determined the costs of the Zunes and iPhones. ",41,mtms2010-08-42a,,
"The student’s justification identified guess and check as the strategy used, which pleased Adam. This student was able to graph the data from the table, label the axes accurately, and use appropriate intervals. The circled point of intersection matched the values circled in the table. Rather than giving a mathematical justification, however, the student simply listed the procedures he followed. Adam’s comment to this student was to pay closer attention to the accuracy of the  graph, which might not have been an issue if the graphic organizer included grid lines. Additionally, the student might benefit from a sample of an “exemplar” justification. The example might include an explanation of what the circled values represent, how the values in the table are represented in the graph, and which of the two representations better illustrates the solution. ",42,mtms2010-08-42a,,
Evidence of Understanding: A Graphing Calculator Is the Next Step,43,mtms2010-08-42a,,
"Student B also included two separate tables to show how the costs of the iPhone were related to the cost of the Zune (see fig. 5). This student calculated values that went beyond the point of intersection and noted where the costs were the same. The graph clearly illustrated that the student  understood how to graphically represent data given in tables for simultaneous equations. However the intervals on the x-axis were inconsistent. The axes were appropriately labeled, and a legend was included. Adam advised the student to be more accurate with the intervals and to think about the intersection of the two graphs. ",44,mtms2010-08-42a,,
"Note that the student did not  reference the point of intersection as having any significance. The calculations include an algebraic solution for the simultaneous equations, which supports an understanding of the problem and the solution. In the future, this student might benefit from adjusting the window settings on a graphing calculator. Manipulating these settings may promote thinking about the domain and range of values for this situation. This student might also be prompted to use the graphing calculator to input equations and check to see if the generated tables match the tables that were hand drawn. Adjusting the window settings to match the manually graphed   “Engaging questions” pull a student into the problem; “clarifying questions”  provide greater insight into the student’s thinking, reasoning, and  understanding; and “refocusing questions” guide the student’s thinking and  prevent him or her from spending time pursuing an inappropriate path.",45,mtms2010-08-42a,,
intervals and comparing the calculator-generated graph with the handdrawn graph is an appropriate use of the graphing calculator. ,46,mtms2010-08-42a,,
Understanding Complete  with Justification,47,mtms2010-08-42a,,
"Student C’s work showed an in-depth understanding of the problem (see fig. 6). This student included two separate tables for each phone but only presented how much one to four phones cost. The tables did not represent the problem situation but rather compared the costs of the Zune with the iPhone. The student used a double-bar graph, which accurately represented the data from the table, but again, it was unrelated to the problem at hand. ",48,mtms2010-08-42a,,
Adam’s comments to the student were encouraging and supportive. He also asked the student to think about an alternative use of the cost of one Zune. The table and graph illustrated that the student could translate between both. His justification showed that he obviously understood the computation that was necessary to answer the question. Adam thought that this student might benefit from a discussion on when it is appropriate to use a bar graph or a line graph. The student explained better than any of the other students how the relative costs were determined. The inclusion of the multiple representations in this student’s work provided evidence that the concept of the problem was understood; it also indicated a possible need for a deeper understanding of appropriate graphs. ,49,mtms2010-08-42a,,

"Fig. 7 Although errors are included in the work, Adam praised this student’s use of symbols.  (a) (b)",52,mtms2010-08-42a,,
"A Symbolic Representation  of the Problem Student D did not use the graphic organizer despite the reference to it in the rubric (see fig. 7). The student did solve simultaneous equations symbolically but made errors in his use of negative signs. Adam was concerned that the omission of the table and graph indicated a conceptual misunderstanding about how to relate a table and a graph to equations that the student could solve procedurally. There was not enough evidence in this student’s work to be sure about his ability to interpret the results of the calculations. The student also checked his work and provided a mathematical justification but neglected to explain his thinking. Instead, he simply made a list of the steps he used. ",53,mtms2010-08-42a,,
"Adam now looks more carefully at  student work and is using his inferences to build subsequent lessons on the understanding or misconceptions he identifies. He admitted he does not have time to examine every problem with such careful consideration but tries to follow this model once a week. He decides during his lesson planning which task or problem to use for this analysis of student progress. Each week, he uses work from a different class, which allows him the luxury of an in-depth analysis of each class twice per quarter. ",54,mtms2010-08-42a,,
"FeedBacK, coMMents,  and Questions Adam provided positive comments and/or asked students clarifying questions. He has found that students have a positive reaction to receiving comments, and they answer the questions he asks in writing to refocus their train of thought. Often they want to take time to explain to him orally what they were thinking. ",55,mtms2010-08-42a,,
This process has moved Adam to  also interview the students about their mathematical thinking and reason-,56,mtms2010-08-42a,,
All students can be engaged in grade-level math  when steps are taken to scaffold and support their learning.  ,57,mtms2010-08-42a,,
"Providing appropriate, or encouraging the use of,  graphic organizers to direct their focus will also  allow all students to achieve a level of success.  ing. He is learning more about the way in which the students think and how to make appropriate instructional decisions. The greatest challenge that Adam faces is framing appropriate questions or choosing appropriate instructional activities when students leave sections of the graphic organizer blank. Student D’s work is an example of this challenge. Adam did validate the symbolic, algebraic solution and praised the student for an appropriate and efficient strategy while noting the computational errors.  suMMary Choosing an interesting yet challenging problem that meets multiple learning objectives is a basic first step in incorporating a problem-solving approach to teaching math. Adam chose to design his own problem to introduce the concept of simultaneous equations. He observed his students communicating a greater understanding of mathematical connections as a result of solving problems that are not linked solely to a topic in a particular chapter of a text. ",58,mtms2010-08-42a,,
"All students can be engaged in  grade-level math when steps are taken to scaffold and support their learning. The simple strategy of using friendly numbers with students who struggle with computation, especially when the big idea of a day’s lesson is algebraic, allows entry for all students. Providing appropriate, or encouraging the use of, graphic organizers to direct their focus will  also allow all students to achieve a level of success.   Giving students an analytic rubric for each problem guides them to see what is important when solving that particular task. If the inclusion of multiple representations is expected, then it should be listed in the rubric. Including multiple representations in student assignments is beneficial to those who not only struggle but also are successful with replicating procedures yet need a nudge to begin thinking about other ways of representing a solution. ",59,mtms2010-08-42a,,
"While students are working  through problems or tasks, the role of the teacher as facilitator is to ask appropriate questions. As Adam has discovered, this is hard work, and it takes time to realize which question to ask and when to ask it. ",60,mtms2010-08-42a,,
"Examining this body of student  work clearly illustrates that these students are at various stages in their algebraic reasoning; most need more experience in justifying their work. On the basis of the evidence in their responses, Adam decided he needed to spend more class time reviewing the difference between listing procedural steps and justifying the solution. ",61,mtms2010-08-42a,,
"Although Adam asked that the  students show each representation in this assignment, he plans to eventually encourage them to include only those representations they believe to be most helpful in understanding the problem and its solution. He wants his students to understand how the  representations relate to one another. Adam is clearly supporting the development of algebraic reasoning in all his students. ",62,mtms2010-08-42a,,
