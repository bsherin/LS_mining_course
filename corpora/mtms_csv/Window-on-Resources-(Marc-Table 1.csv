4,Window on Resources (March 2016) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"This book addresses the Common Core math standards for grades 3â€“5 and is intended to be used by elementary teachers, principals, and mathematics specialists to help in planning lessons. It can also be used as a toolkit for understanding how standards connect across clusters and grade levels. The book is divided into five domains across the grade levels.",,
5,Window on Resources (March 2016) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The Common Core Mathematics Companion has good illustrations for various concepts and gives useful examples of misconceptions and common errors that students may make in the classroom. Also included are sample planning pages and reflection questions for teachers to use and think about while planning a lesson around the standards. For each cluster, related content standards are given, allowing teachers to see where students will go with the information and what came before the current grade level.",,
6,Window on Resources (March 2016) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,I would use this book as a starting place to plan lessons because it gives a teacher a good idea of activities and some examples for each standard. I would also use this text with preservice teachers to help them write lesson plans that are based on the standards.,,

12,Window on Resources (March 2016) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Barbara J. Reys and Robert E. Reys have curated selected academic pieces written by Zalman Usiskin throughout his extensive career as a mathematics educator and researcher. The editors compiled the selections into six major categories that cover questions about both curriculum and social justice. Usiskinâ€™s commitment to â€œmathematics for allâ€ is woven through-out much of the collection, both in articles specifically presented to address equity in mathematics education and in articles devoted to more pedantic topics such as division of fractions.",,
13,Window on Resources (March 2016) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Within each section, the selected texts are organized chronologically. This choice allows the reader, by accident, or more likely, by design, to induce the spiral of history within mathematics education. History certainly repeats itself, as evidenced by Usiskinâ€™s argument in 1987 in favor of teaching algebra in eighth grade, a point echoed today in the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics. Moving forward, we also see how Usiskinâ€™s multiple analyses have dramatically evolved concerning his general opinions about which students can learn algebra and which students can learn calculus.",,
14,Window on Resources (March 2016) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,This anthology would be best suited to mathematics teachers and education professors who are interested in a history of mathematics education in the United States over the past half century. Readers will find comfort in the evidence of progress made; they will also have their thinking challenged by Usiskinâ€™s arguments about what remains to be accomplished.,,

21,Window on Resources (March 2016) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The first part of Arithmetic for Parents focuses on the nature of mathematics, the authorâ€™s journey map, and the material that should be taught. The second part focuses on teaching principles, the rules that govern progressing from the concrete to the abstract, and advice to parents on familiarizing themselves with trends that determine the character of their childâ€™s school. The third part discusses the arithmetic studied in elementary school, accompanied by personal stories, historical anecdotes, and teaching suggestions. An appendix explores the current politics of mathematics.",,
22,Window on Resources (March 2016) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Ron Aharoni also explains the logic of arithmetic. The book explores the meaning of addition, subtraction,multiplication, and division and the calculation of these operations. Fractions, decimals, ratio, and proportion are also covered. Aharoni breaks down the information, so that anyone can understand the simple approach to mathematics, and presents all in a manner that is nonintimidating, noncondescending, and courteous. One fascinating thing about the book is the use of narrative discourse to teach the fundamentals of mathematics.",,
23,Window on Resources (March 2016) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,I highly recommend the book to parents who have math phobias as well as those who want to brush up on their math skills to assist their children with homework assignments. It will give parents the confidence to help their children succeed and thrive in mathematics.,,
24,Window on Resources (March 2016) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"My only concern about the book is that there may not be enough exercises to ensure that all the knowledge acquired will stick. Moreover, no answers are provided to the exercises to guide students and parents.",,

Human Relations Media; http://www.hrm video.com.",,
30,Window on Resources (March 2016) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The content of Math Mysteries: Crimes, Capers and Whodunits falls within the sixth-grade Common Core Standards. The purpose is to engage sixth-grade students as they solve mysteries while using a range of math skill applications.",,
31,Window on Resources (March 2016) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The strengths of the series is that the program incorporates Common Core math skills and higher-order thinking skills. The DVDs have a simple menu that could be used in a whole-class setting, with small groups, or individually. Students could easily use this product.",,
32,Window on Resources (March 2016) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The video segments are entertaining and will keep studentsâ€™ attention. The quality of the videos is very good. The actors are easy to understand, and the detectives explain solutions in a simple, matter-of-fact way. Other strengths include that the teacher notes and student investigations are well organized and easy to follow and that the scenarios have real-life applications. The only weakness I found is that the program is limited to the sixth-grade Common Core Math Standards only.",,
33,Window on Resources (March 2016) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,I recommend this program to any sixth-grade math teacher. The videos do a wonderful job of incorporating content into mysteries that require higher-order thinking and math-practice skills.,,

39,Window on Resources (March 2016) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In The Proof and the Pudding, Jim Henle makes a comparison between mathematics and cooking. He describes the many ways that the two are alike and that if a person is successful at one, then he or she can be successful at the other. He makes quite a case that the same problem-solving skills are used for both endeavors and that both mathematicians and cooks â€œplayâ€â€”one does so with numbers and the other, with food.",,
40,Window on Resources (March 2016) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"While reading, I realized that he is absolutely right. Oftentimes, when I am either cooking or working out math problems, I realize that something is going wrong and start analyzing to try to â€œfixâ€ my mistakesâ€”using the same strategies for both.",,
41,Window on Resources (March 2016) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"This book, a thoroughly enjoyable read, will appeal to both mathematicians and cooks, both amateur and professional. However, the difficulty of some of the math will probably make it intimidating to anyone who is not at least an amateur mathematician. The author includes a lot of recipes, and I am looking forward to trying them to see if they are as exceptional as he claims.",,
42,Window on Resources (March 2016) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I really like the way Henle includes the equipment necessary for the recipes with the ingredient list. I think this is because he is first and foremost a mathematician, which lends a great deal of logical thinking to his explanations and directions for his recipes.",,
43,Window on Resources (March 2016) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In chapter 20 on economy, Henle mentions â€œreverse mathematicsâ€ but never fully explains what it is or how it ties to his topic. In the chapter on ethics, he explores a proof of an irrational number to the power of an irrational number but I admit I got a bit lost in his explanation. I imagine that anyone who does not spend a lot time working with square numbers would have even more difficulty. This could potentially be a fantastic resource for high school, maybe middle school family and consumer science classes (formerly known as home economics). What better way to promote problem solving while teaching students to bake bread! It is important to show students that math can be found outside the classroom.",,
44,Window on Resources (March 2016) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I think Henle does a masterful job of connecting math and cooking, demonstrating that math does not always include numbers and that it can be fun!",,
