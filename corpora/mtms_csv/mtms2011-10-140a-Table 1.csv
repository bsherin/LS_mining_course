"solUtions 1.  The factors are composed of an  equal number of 1s. The products are palindromes. (Students may say that the numbers read the same backward and forward or increase by 1s and decrease the same way.) 2.  All the answers are the original one-digit number repeated to  become a two-digit number  (e.g., 11 × 8 = 88).  3.  165, 286, 462, 693, 781. Students should notice that the answer will be a three-digit number whose first and last digits are the same as the first and last digits of the original two-digit number and whose middle digit is the sum of the  digits of the two-digit number (e.g., 11 × 34 = 374; 11 × 54 = 594). Have students explain why this happens. If they look at the standard multiplication algorithm, they should see why.  4.  429, 517, 638, 737, 825. Students  should notice that this question is similar to question 3. However, since the sum of the digits is greater than 10, you have to add 1 to the hundreds place. One example is the following:    85  ×11    85  850  935 5.  Students might answer: “The  units digit of the new number is the same as the original. Add the digits of the two-digit number. If they are less than 10, use that sum for the middle digit of the answer. Then put the tens digit of the two-digit number in the hundreds place of the answer. If the sum of the digits is greater than 10, the middle digit of the answer will be the units digit from the sum of the original digits. The hundreds digit will be 1 more than the original tens digit.” 6.  As with multiplying two-digit  numbers by 11, the units digit of the answer will be the same as in the original number, the tens digit ",9,mtms2011-10-140a,,

I used this cartoon with my fourthgrade math class as a multidigit multiplication review for our upcoming state criterion-reference test for math. The students were overjoyed to see a “funny cartoon” used in their math lesson. (“This is so cool!” they remarked.) They said that the problems were easy and that I really should try harder to challenge them. They loved solving the math problems and making predictions and conjectures about what would happen before they started to answer each question. They even tried a few problems beyond the assignment to test their hypotheses and to see which were the most accurate. ,17,mtms2011-10-140a,,
All the students learned a great  deal about patterns in multiplication and loved the math investigation of the lesson. A few of the students wrote comments at the end of their assignment to let me know that they “would love to try more math like this because it’s so fun and mentally challenging.” I wish I had tried this assignment during the first nine weeks of school when the students were working on multiplication; even my reluctant multipliers enjoyed the lesson.,18,mtms2011-10-140a,,
"I challenged my students to see  if other numbers produced the same patterns as the units digit, and I offered that question as an extra-credit option on the assignment. Over half the class attempted it. The very competitive ones continued to try to find one even  after the assignment was completed and graded. They were very curious as to why some numbers have patterns and why others (which students thought might be “a pattern number”) do not. They asked if there were more patterns in other areas of math that they could investigate when we were to finish with the state math test. ",19,mtms2011-10-140a,,

"I used this activity with my advanced eighth-grade class in April. They had trouble writing the patterns that they observed, but each student was able to explain the patterns verbally. We had covered patterns and sequences at the beginning of the year, and this exercise provided another opportunity to discuss patterns while also increasing number sense. ",21,mtms2011-10-140a,,
"My students were truly challenged by the challenge question. They asked to be placed in pairs and were successful after about ten minutes of working with partners. Overall, the class enjoyed the activity sheet and the chance to work with patterns. ",22,mtms2011-10-140a,,

"I used this cartoon with my seventhgrade students in the spring during the week of our state test. They were tired and needed something interesting  and engaging to energize them, and this cartoon was perfect. My students really struggled with number sense so whenever possible I try to find patterns that will help them acquire a better understanding of how numbers work. We read the cartoon as a whole class, and a few skeptical students wanted to check the math on a calculator before they believed it. I structured the activity so that students saw only one question at a time, worked individually for a few moments, and then turned to a neighbor to share their thoughts. ",25,mtms2011-10-140a,,
"The room exploded with enthusiasm as students began to understand the pattern and to help those around them who had not seen it yet. One of my students wondered aloud what happened when the digits of a number multiplied by 11 add to more than 9, so it was a natural extension for us to move into question 4. It was a lot of fun to take a rather simple idea (multiplying by 11) and look at it more deeply. The students appreciated the challenge, and one even remarked, “This is magical!” We did not get to the challenge activity. ",26,mtms2011-10-140a,,
"Some of my students were troubled  by the fact that they were tethered to multiplying only certain numbers by 11 so I challenged them to choose some two-digit numbers and see if the pattern works all the time. It was fun to have them report their results to me once they completed that task, and they seemed to feel both empowered  and smart. They valued being able to extend it on their own. It also allowed me to lengthen the activity for those who were ready for a bigger challenge but not quite ready for the challenge of multiplying by three-digit numbers. Donna M.

"I teach seventh-grade students who are often reluctant to explore because of the gaps in their basic skills. To draw my students into this problem, I began by asking them what they knew about the number 11 before I displayed the cartoon. This generated more excitement than I expected, with students sharing all sorts of facts about 11, including real number subset information. One student mentioned that it was easy to multiply by 11. That was what I had been hoping for, and I grabbed the opportunity. ",29,mtms2011-10-140a,,
"My students related to me that if  they multiplied 11 by a one-digit number, they got the same number for both digits of the answer. We tried a few to make sure, and then I distributed the cartoon and activity sheet. My students enjoyed reading the cartoon. I asked them to work on question 3 in small groups. Students soon began noticing a connection between the digits in the product and those in the factor. In no time, students were able to tell me the product without using a calculator or writing out the partial products. I asked them to try to find some other examples that worked, and one student found a number that did not work. We were on to question 4 to see if we could figure out what was different.",30,mtms2011-10-140a,,
"This problem gave my students an opportunity to explore number theory in a very student-friendly situation. They felt comfortable enough with the mathematics to explore and take  risks. The work itself quickly helped me sort out who was struggling. I was able to tier the activity, giving some students a chance to work ahead and move on to the challenge while I scaffolded the activity for others. ",31,mtms2011-10-140a,,
