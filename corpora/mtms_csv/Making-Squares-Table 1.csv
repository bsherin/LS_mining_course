10,Making Squares,"Ms. Harper needs a large number of congruent squares for a craft project for her students. She fi nds a large piece of cardboard that measures 588 cm × 630 cm. She would like to use all the cardboard, with no waste, and wants the squares to be as large as possible.",10,Making Squares
11,Making Squares,1.  What are the dimensions of the largest squares that Ms. Harper can  create without having any leftover cardboard? Remember that all squares must be congruent. How do you know that no other larger size is possible? 2. How many squares of that size will Ms. Harper be able to create?   Ms. Harper decides that a nonsquare rectangle might work better for her  students’ craft project. She cuts the 588 cm × 630 cm piece of cardboard into 108 congruent rectangles with no waste.  3. What are the dimensions of the rectangles that Ms. Harper could create? Are there any other dimensions she could have used? How do you know?,11,Making Squares

I know this is the largest because 42 is the greatest common factor, so no greater number fits evenly into both sides. This means that squares with larger dimensions cannot be made from the cardboard without leftover pieces.” Charlene’s explanation is a good example of a student using ",18,Making Squares

According to Donahue, her students this year have struggled with “taking academic risks for fear of being wrong.” In fact, early on in the problem-solving process, some students needed encouragement to try a different method ",19,Making Squares
20,Making Squares,Fig. 2 Charlene took this approach to find the greatest common factor of 588 and 630.,20,Making Squares
21,Making Squares,"tTwo main strategies for finding the  largest square emerged in an analysis of student work on the Making Squares problem. Although all students who submitted work realized that finding the greatest common factor of 588 cm and 630 cm was a key step in determining the size of the largest square that could be created with no waste, how they found the greatest common factor differed. Some students did so by explicitly listing all the factors of 630 and 588 and then finding the largest factor present in both lists. Other students used the prime factorization algorithm to find the greatest common factor of the two numbers. ",21,Making Squares
22,Making Squares,"Angel, Adrian, Ayan, and  ",22,Making Squares
23,Making Squares,"Brandon, seventh-grade students of Kathryn Boemio at 498 Van Nest Academy in Bronx, New York, stated that the greatest common factor of the two dimensions would be the side length of the largest possible square that could be created with no waste from the sheet of cardboard. They found the greatest common factor by creating exhaustive lists of factor pairs for each dimension of the piece of cardboard (see fig. 1). These students used Standard for Mathematical Practice (SMP) 4, make use of models, as they created a table to organize their work. ",23,Making Squares
24,Making Squares,"Charlene, a seventh-grade student of Colleen Donahue at Horace Mann Middle School in Franklin, Massachusetts, also found the greatest common factor of 630 and 588, but did so by using a prime factorization algorithm (see fig. 2). Charlene explained her work by saying, “The largest squares Ms. Harper could make are 42 by 42 ",24,Making Squares
25,Making Squares,"Fig. 3 Angel, Adrian, Aya, and Brandon’s visual showed how 210 squares can be cut from the large piece of cardboard.",25,Making Squares
26,Making Squares,"or work through their frustration. Donahue stated, “Charlene was one of the students who began frustrated but stuck with the problem and produced an excellent piece of work.” ",26,Making Squares
27,Making Squares,"Another student from Donahue’s class, Sydney, also exemplifi ed perseverance and problem solving. Sydney found the greatest common factor of 630 and 588 by using a prime factorization algorithm, but she did not realize that 42 is the size of side length of the largest possible square. At fi rst she thought that the 42 should relate to the number of students in Harper’s class (information that is not given in the Making Squares problem statement) and conjectured that the class size could be 21 since 21 is a factor of 42. Continuing, Sydney did a variety of calculations and incorrectly decided that Harper could make 21 squares each with an area of 840 square centimeters. Sydney did not state the side length of each of her squares. As Sydney continued, however, she realized that her work on this problem did not depend on the size of the class and needed to be revised. In her reﬂ ection on the problem, she wrote, “At the beginning, I thought the GCF of the  dimensions would be the class size. This sent me down the wrong path so I did not create the largest possible squares. Instead I should have divided the size of the cardboard ÷ GCF².”",27,Making Squares
28,Making Squares,"Once students discovered the size of the largest possible square, they set about fi nding the answer to the second part of the problem, determining the quantity of 42 cm by 42 cm squares that could be created from the 588 cm by 630 cm piece of cardboard. Charlene divided the dimensions of the large piece of cardboard each by 42 to fi nd how many squares would fi t along each side of that piece of cardboard. She then multiplied those two numbers together to fi nd that 210 squares could be created. Angel, Adrian, Aya, and Brandon included a visual in their work that clearly shows how the 210 squares could be arranged with 14 squares fi tting along the 588 cm side and 15 squares fi tting along the 630 cm side (see fi g. 3). In the visual, the number 1764 represents the area in square centimeters of each cardboard square, and the number 42 represents the length of each side of the square in centime- ters. From this visual, the students determined that they could create 210 squares, arranged in 15 rows of 14 squares. This group of students also checked their work by multiplying the number of squares by their area to be sure it matched the area of the large piece of cardboard. Tyler and Justin, seventh-grade students in Donahue’s class, also approached this problem in a similar manner.",28,Making Squares
29,Making Squares,"The third part of the problem  asked students to fi nd possible dimensions of a rectangle so that 108 identical rectangles could be cut out of the large piece of cardboard with no waste. Most students started by fi nding the area of each smaller rectangle by dividing the area of the large piece of cardboard by 108. They then found factor pairs of that number to produce a list of possible dimensions for the rectangle. Students then checked each factor pair to see if one of the factors was a factor of 588 and the other a factor of 630 (the dimensions of the original piece of cardboard). Tyler and Justin’s work, shown in fi gure 4, is a good example of this approach. They correctly determined that there are two possible rectangles that Harper could use, either 98 cm by 35 cm or 49 cm by 70 cm. Their work is a good example of SMP 6, attend to precision, as they kept track of what each number in the problem represented, and SMP 2, reason abstractly and quantitatively, as they made connections between their calculations and the context of the problem. ",29,Making Squares
30,Making Squares,"Throughout this problem, students needed to keep track of what each of their numbers from their calculations represented. For most of the students, using visuals and labels on their work helped them understand whether a number represented an area, a side length, or a quantity of squares or rectangles. Students clearly related their calculations to the problem ",30,Making Squares
31,Making Squares,Fig. 4 Tyler and Justin used this sequence of steps to find possible dimensions of the smaller rectangles.,31,Making Squares
32,Making Squares,"context. In fact, Donahue noted that students in her class were initially concerned that they had not been told the size of the class. After reading the problem several times, they realized that they did not need that information to solve the problem. However,  that would be a potential interesting piece of information to add if a teacher wished to use this problem in the future. Unfortunately, since the greatest common factor of 210 (the number of congruent squares) and 108 (the number of congruent rect- angles) is 6, trying to share the rectangles and squares fairly so that each student would get the same materials for their craft project would result in a very small class! Perhaps Ms. Harper intended to cut out a few extra of each shape so that she had some for students to use in case of error. In  that case, a class size of 25 would  yield 8 extra rectangles or 10 extra squares, whereas a class size of 24 would result in 12 extra rectangles or 18 extra squares.",32,Making Squares
