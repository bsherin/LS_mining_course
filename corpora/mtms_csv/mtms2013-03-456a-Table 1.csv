"Pharmacists need to know approximately how long medications stay in a person’s body. A half-life is the approximate time it takes for the body to remove 1/2 of the active ingredient in a medicine. If a person takes 1 milligram of aspirin, and 2 hours later 1/2 milligram (mg) of aspirin remains in the body, the half-life of aspirin is 2 hours. After another 2 hours, there would be 1/4 mg aspirin in the body (i.e., 1/2 of what remained after the ﬁ rst 2 hours).",4,mtms2013-03-456a,,
