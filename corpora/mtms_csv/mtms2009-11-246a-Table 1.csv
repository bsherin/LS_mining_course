This resource was designed to be used as a professional development tool to support teachers and leaders in school districts as they begin the process of focusing the curriculum that they are required to teach. ,6,mtms2009-11-246a,,
"An overview of NCTM’s Curriculum Focal Points is given, then the book goes on to describe how it can be used to assist with the process of focusing state and local curricula on major areas of emphasis for each grade level.",7,mtms2009-11-246a,,
"The book details what instruction in a focused curriculum would look like, emphasizing the selection of tasks that engage students in a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts and the connections among them. The mathematical content knowledge needed by teachers to sup-",8,mtms2009-11-246a,,
"Prices on software, books, and materials are subject to change. Consult the suppliers for the current prices. The comments reflect the reviewers’ opinions and do not imply endorsement by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics.  port this type of students learning and why professional development is important to support that knowledge development are also addressed. Finally, the need for assessment in a focused curriculum to measure not only the correct answer but, more important, the depth of students’ understanding is emphasized. ",9,mtms2009-11-246a,,
"Tasks that focus on different topics  and reflection questions that can be used individually or as part of wholegroup discussions are provided. A large portion of the resource is devoted to appendixes that contain useful examples. I believe the activities suggested in  the text are best suited for groups of teachers led by either a district leader or lead teachers at individual school sites. Although individual teachers could certainly use this resource and reflect on their own practice, they will be unable to change curriculum without the necessary support of the other teachers and district leaders at the school sites. Grade-level books are being developed that might be more practical for individual teachers’ use.  Trish Kridler,",10,mtms2009-11-246a,,

"Mathematics for every student: Responding to diversity, grades 6–8 Mark W. Ellis and Carol E. Malloy, eds., 2008. 118 pp., $22.95 paper. Stock no. 13409. ISBN 978-0-87353-6127. National Council of Teachers of Mathematics; www.nctm.org. ",13,mtms2009-11-246a,,
"Mathematics for Every Student: Responding to Diversity presents an overview to the challenge of teaching every student in the mathematics  classroom. One statement in the Introduction sums up the goal of the book: “Teachers have the responsibilities to determine strategies, both affective and cognitive, that together support all students as they learn mathematics.”",14,mtms2009-11-246a,,
"Many of the ten chapters were  written by successful teachers in the field who relate their experiences teaching all students mathematics. Chapter topics include teaching minority students, those with special needs and disabilities, and students who are unmotivated.",15,mtms2009-11-246a,,
Several chapters discuss differentiated instruction. Chapter titles include “Giving Students Mathematical Power through Differentiated Instruction”; “Supporting Middle School Students with Learning Disabilities in the Mathematics Classroom”; “Self-Differentiating in Inclusions Classrooms”; “Opportunities to Learn”; and “My Students Aren’t Motivated—What Can I Do?”,16,mtms2009-11-246a,,
"None of the chapters fully covers the topic at hand, which is to be expected. The book does not claim to do so; it would be an impossibly large volume if it did. Instead, each chapter presents research, classroom practices, references, and suggestions for math teachers to begin meeting the needs of their students. In this, the book certainly succeeds. ",17,mtms2009-11-246a,,
"For any teacher pondering how  to reach all the students in class, this book is an excellent starting point.",18,mtms2009-11-246a,,

"Students of grades 4 and up would find A Story of Natural Numbers   interesting. It takes the reader through the history, usefulness, and interesting facts of natural numbers. It also compares natural numbers with other systems that have existed throughout the years. This book would be a good addition to any mathematics teacher’s library. It is engaging, insightful, and amusing, and the content is presented in a fun and whimsical way.",20,mtms2009-11-246a,,
"The presentation of the book  engages the reader and makes it easy to read. It could be used to open or enrich many mathematics lessons. Who knew that numbers could be so much fun?  —Naomi Strickland, South Central Middle School, Emerson, GA 30137  tag: Middle Math is it!",21,mtms2009-11-246a,,

"TAG, which stands for tricks, activities, and games, is filled with ideas that teachers can use to engage students in number and operations, algebra, geometry, measurement, and data analysis and probability. Each idea includes an objective, procedures, materials (if necessary), and explanation of solutions. Each strand is divided into TAG sections: Tricks are quick ideas used as entry tasks or stand-alone problems; activities are extensive opportunities to supplement the curriculum; and games allow students to play and apply mathematical reasoning skills.",23,mtms2009-11-246a,,
"One strength of the book is its annotated table of contents. A onesentence description allows teachers to search ideas. A second strength is the number of tricks (82), activities (95), and games (33). Both items help the book serve as a launching point for creative teachers to design their own lessons for students.",24,mtms2009-11-246a,,
"Weaknesses include having to  rewrite or photocopy images to create a handout for students. The lessons’ ideas are not intended for the teacher looking to use a ready-made lesson with little alteration. Many of the listed questions begin with “Which,” “How,” or “What,” leaving the teacher to alter them to create higher-level questioning strategies. ",25,mtms2009-11-246a,,
"I would not use this book as a  recurring resource because of the time  it takes to create the activities and adapt the questions; however, many of the tricks would be useful for entry tasks. The preface explains that the book is designed to give the teacher ideas that he or she can apply but will have to alter “. . . to fit your style, your children, or your curriculum.” —Corey Heitschmidt, Housel Middle School, Prosser, WA 99350",26,mtms2009-11-246a,,
