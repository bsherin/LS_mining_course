0,Stretching Probability Explorations with Geoboards - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Students are faced with many transitions in their middle school mathematics classes. To build knowledge, skills, and confidence in the key areas of algebra and geometry, students often need to practice using numbers and polygons in a variety of contexts. Meanwhile, we also want students to explore ideas from probability and statistics. Teachers know that one way to help students navigate these transitions is to use hands-on activities and manipulatives, but it can be a struggle to find probability and statistics activities that go beyond employing spinners, M&Mâ€™sÂ®, dice, coins, and bags of marbles. This led us to consider geoboards as an alternative manipulative for helping students explore probability.",,
1,Stretching Probability Explorations with Geoboards - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Geoboards, rectangular boards with equally spaced pegs, were invented in the 1950s by Egyptian mathematician Caleb Gattegno (Gattegno 1971). Teachers using geoboards have shared many exciting investigations in geometry and discrete mathematics (e.g., Allen 2013; Russell 2008; Scavo 1995). Students can begin using geoboards as early as preschool, making shapes by stretching rubber bands or wrapping string around the pegs. Later, teachers use geoboards to help students learn about polygons, transformations (e.g., translations, rotations, reflections), angles, area, perimeter, and countless more topics. Geoboards are simple and inexpensive; free virtual versions are also available. In this article, we share an engaging geoboard activity that integrates key middle school concepts found in geometry, algebra, and probability.",,
2,Stretching Probability Explorations with Geoboards - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,SETTING THE STAGE,,
3,Stretching Probability Explorations with Geoboards - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"During a series of classes for preservice middle school teachers, we started exploring ways to use geoboards to build connections among important ideas in number sense, geometry, algebra, and probability. Before the activity was introduced, students had become familiar with geoboards through an exploration of area and perimeter; they had also been introduced to theoretical and experimental probability using common examples (e.g., playing cards, dice, and coins). Combining these ideas, we built an activity guided by the following question:",,
4,Stretching Probability Explorations with Geoboards - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,What are the chances that a randomly selected location on the geoboard belongs to a specified region?,,
5,Stretching Probability Explorations with Geoboards - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"This question is reminiscent of the classic game Battleshipâ„¢, in which players take turns trying to â€œsinkâ€ boats that are positioned on a lattice of pegs by selecting coordinates on which to fire missiles. The key difference here is that the regions are known in advance, and the pegs are selected at random.",,
6,Stretching Probability Explorations with Geoboards - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"One immediate challenge we faced in developing the activity was working with the physical constraints of  the geoboards. We wanted to use a  10 peg Ã— 15 peg array, but we only had 5 peg Ã— 5 peg and 10 peg Ã— 10 peg square boards. Since we taught the lesson six times, we tried three versions of the activity: In one version, we combined the smaller and larger square boards to make a slightly misshapen  10 peg Ã— 15 peg board; in another version, students used a free Geoboard iPadÂ® app (Clarity Innovations 2012) with a class set of iPads; and in the third version, students worked with a printed array of dots on large paper. We found that the iPad version of the activity worked best (more colors were available for the virtual rubber bands, plus there were no worries about rubber bands flying off the geoboards). However, all formats worked well with small changes to the instructions, so we encourage teachers to use whichever version makes the most sense in their classroom.",,
7,Stretching Probability Explorations with Geoboards - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"GETTING STARTED: SHAPES, PEGS, AND PROBABILITY",,
8,Stretching Probability Explorations with Geoboards - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The activity started with students  creating a 10 peg Ã— 15 peg rectangle and partitioning the space horizontally and vertically into four smaller rectangles. The intersection of the horizontal and vertical partition lines was the origin of a coordinate plane, with quadrants numbered from I to IV counterclockwise from the upper right. Students placed an isosceles triangle in one quadrant, formed a sailboat out of a trapezoid and triangle, and placed it in another quadrant (as shown in  fig. 1). This configuration created a number of polygon regions that were used to explore the guiding question.",,
9,Stretching Probability Explorations with Geoboards - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
10,Stretching Probability Explorations with Geoboards - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Next, we asked students to think about the theoretical probability that a randomly selected location within the 10 peg Ã— 15 peg (â€œlargeâ€) rectangle would â€œhitâ€ specific regions.",,

21,Stretching Probability Explorations with Geoboards - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"To build number sense, we asked students (aided by a calculator) to write each answer in three ways: as a fraction, as a decimal (rounded to the nearest hundredth), and as a percentage. See figure 2 for two groupsâ€™ responses to the first part of the task.",,
22,Stretching Probability Explorations with Geoboards - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
23,Stretching Probability Explorations with Geoboards - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The difference between the two parts of the task is the change from a continuous region with an area of  126 square units in the first to a discrete set of 150 pegs within the region in the second. Distinguishing between continuous and discrete contexts is a key skill in probability and statistics, and the geoboard provides a hands-on example. Many students initially struggled to switch between these two contexts, with many insisting that the denominators should be 150 in both situations (since the large rectangle was formed by a 10 peg Ã— 15 peg array). The apparent preference for thinking about the geoboard shapes as (continuous) areas instead of (discrete) collections of pegs took us by surprise; we expected students to find counting pegs to be more natural than calculating areas. This may have originated from the studentsâ€™ experience using geoboards to calculate areas and perimeter, coupled with the somewhat counterintuitive property that a segment containing, for example, 15 pegs has a length of 14 units. However, we could usually help students clear up any confusion quickly by simply asking them to directly count the number of square units in a few of the rectangles.",,
24,Stretching Probability Explorations with Geoboards - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Students also struggled with the number-sense feature of the task; some simplified the fractions incorrectly, some made rounding errors, and others made mistakes when converting decimals to percentages. We initially tried not to correct these errors because we knew that students would get a chance to rethink their answers later in the activity. In the first part, some students struggled to find the area of some of the polygons, which led to rich group and whole-class discussions involving inventive strategies of calculating the areas of shapes and composite figures by dissecting shapes, subtracting pieces, and using symmetry. In one class, a student asked if there was a way to calculate the area using the pegs, allowing for a brief discussion of Pickâ€™s theorem (which gives the area of geoboard polygons as a function of the pegs on the interior and boundary edges; see, e.g., Russell 2008). Finally, many groups struggled in the second part of the task to account for the peg connecting the â€œsailâ€ to the â€œboat.â€ This part of the task provided nice opportunities to talk with students about avoiding â€œdouble countingâ€ the peg, which is another important concept in probability (e.g., also used when considering the intersection of Venn diagrams).",,
25,Stretching Probability Explorations with Geoboards - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,RUNNING THE EXPERIMENT,,
26,Stretching Probability Explorations with Geoboards - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"After students had a chance to think about the discrete and continuous probability models from a theoretical perspective, we asked the students to run an experiment by randomly selecting locations on the geoboard. To generate the random trials, students would either (a) build walls around their board and repeatedly toss a small cube onto the board or (b) draw a pair of x- and y-coordinates (with replacement) from a bag using the axes implied by the vertical and horizontal partitions on the geoboard. These two approaches simulated the continuous and discrete processes, respectively, from the previous task, and each group of students ran 10 trials of their experiment.",,

37,Stretching Probability Explorations with Geoboards - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,INTERPRETING THE DATA,,
38,Stretching Probability Explorations with Geoboards - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The design of the experiment helped illustrate an important feature of experimental probability (based on the Law of Large Numbers): Experimental probability values determined by a small number of trials are expected to vary more widely from theoretical probabilities than experimental probability values determined by a larger number of trials. Many groups saw this scenario happen, obtaining experimental probability values typically similar to, but sometimes quite different from, the values they calculated in the theoretical probability task. Fortunately, when we asked students to predict what would happen if we pooled the data from all groups, most students correctly predicted that the experimental probabilities would be much closer to the theoretical probability values.",,
39,Stretching Probability Explorations with Geoboards - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"One nice feature of this activity was that the experimental probability values often caused students to rethink their theoretical probability calculations. For example, during the experiment, many students asked how to find the experimental probability of hitting the coordinates (0, 12) when it was not even a point on the board because of the position of the origin in the upper-right corner of the large rectangle. Since some groups had originally stated that the theoretical probability of hitting (0, 12) was 1/150, the experimental trials actually helped them question their earlier answers and correctly change the theoretical probability to 0.",,
40,Stretching Probability Explorations with Geoboards - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,CREATING CONFIGURATIONS,,
41,Stretching Probability Explorations with Geoboards - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"As a final task, we gave students a blank geoboard and asked them to answer a puzzle that involved creating their own configuration, so that the regions would have a specified set of discrete and continuous probabilities.Students were asked to create shapes on a single geoboard so that all the following theoretical probability  values were satisfied.",,

51,Stretching Probability Explorations with Geoboards - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,â€¢ a peg in quadrant II (upper left) is equal to 4/75.,,
52,Stretching Probability Explorations with Geoboards - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"It was not surprising that some students initially struggled with this task, which combined both continuous and discrete probability values and included a number of â€œunknownsâ€ (e.g., where to put the origin and how to make a house with a chimney). Several groups asked for a recipe-like process for creating the geoboard arrangement. Instead, we asked them to think through possibilities and try ideas, assuring the students that there was at least one way to solve the problem. Number sense was a source of struggle here too, with students finding it difficult to compare simplified fractions with different denominators, such as 21 and 126. This simplifying issue led to some nice discussions about comparing fractions, common denominators, and equivalent fractions. Once students recalled that the large 10 peg Ã— 15 peg rectangle contained 126 square units, they tended to make quick progress when finding solutions. In a postactivity reflection, one of the students summarized her thinking process:",,
53,Stretching Probability Explorations with Geoboards - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The third part of this activity was the hardest one. It was really confusing trying to figure out each of the quadrants on the geoboard. Also, I think what confused me the most was that I found the area of the geoboard first and I got 150 cm, so when I looked at [the problem] on the paper where it said that the house on the geoboard had to be a composite figure of 17/126, I thought it did not make sense because the house should be composed out of 17/150, since the area of the whole square was 150 cm, but at the end I noticed that I didnâ€™t take away the squares from the other quadrants so that the house could be composed out of 17/150.",,
54,Stretching Probability Explorations with Geoboards - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Several groups tried solving the task by creating x- and y-axes, which were either not perpendicular or were not straight lines. So although we congratulated these students on their creativity, we had to inform them that to correctly solve the problem, the axes needed to be vertical and horizontal lines.",,
55,Stretching Probability Explorations with Geoboards - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Ultimately, students invented some innovative solutions to the third task. Some students created more traditional-looking houses than others (some may be more aptly described as â€œabstract modernâ€), but all seemed to learn important skills about creating and computing the areas of composite figures (because of the chimney requirement). See figure 3 for two examples of studentsâ€™ solutions to the third task.",,

57,Stretching Probability Explorations with Geoboards - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,THE BIG PICTURE,,
58,Stretching Probability Explorations with Geoboards - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Our experience from developing and presenting this geoboard activity is that it helped students see the beauty and interconnectedness of mathematics at the middle school level, especially some important but often overlooked ideas in probability. The hands-on, inquiry-style format of the tasks promoted a real sense of productive struggle among the small groups of students. The preservice teachers seemed to understand the value of this kind of activity for their future teaching. One studentâ€™s reflection illustrated the mix of fun and challenge that we hoped for as we developed the activity:",,
59,Stretching Probability Explorations with Geoboards - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The geoboard activities we did in tonightâ€™s class were great! The first part of the geoboard activityâ€”with experimental probabilityâ€”was a lot of fun. I thought it was much more difficult when we had to make the shapes on the geoboard! My  table/group seemed to struggle a little bit when trying to create the house with a chimney but we were eventually able to figure it out. I think the geoboard app is a great resource for math teachers. In fact, I have seen it being used in the elementary school where I am currently student teaching!",,
