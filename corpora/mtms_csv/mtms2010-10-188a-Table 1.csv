"This book presents the “big picture” of grade 7 mathematics through extensive details and examples of three curricular Focal Points: proportionality, surface area and volume, and the rational number system. This book helps teachers link their own curriculum and standards to these Focal Points. Instructional progression charts set the Focal Points ",6,mtms2010-10-188a,,

"The problems and examples make  excellent use of multiple representations, such as when comparing additive and multiplicative thinking. A wide variety of visual models are provided, including ratio tables and strip, bar, and charged-field models. These combinations have seldom been seen in other teacher resource books. The charged-field model was new to me yet could arguably be the most useful visual to represent integer multiplication. ",8,mtms2010-10-188a,,
"Student dialogue, while thorough, seems unrealistic. It may set up novice teachers for failure as they try to achieve the same level of classroom discourse. The book would benefit from an index of concepts, skills, models, representations, and problems. ",9,mtms2010-10-188a,,
"The intended audience of this resource is preservice teachers, although it would support both preservice and in-service teachers. I recommend that this book be used within a book study. For a richer learning experience, teachers should solve the problems ahead of time. Providing blackline masters would facilitate this process and make this book more user-friendly. The “Reflect as You Read” questions could be used as discussion points among teachers during the book study.",10,mtms2010-10-188a,,

FRoM otheR PUBlisheRs accessible Mathematics: 10 instructional shifts that Raise student achievement,12,mtms2010-10-188a,,
"Steven Leinwand, 2009. 128 pp., $17.00 paper. ISBN 978‑0‑325‑02656‑5. Heinemann; www.heinemann.com.",13,mtms2010-10-188a,,
"Stephen Leinwand’s slim volume Accessible Mathematics: 10 Instructional Shifts That Raise Student Achievement contains a wealth of practical information packaged in small, doable increments. Accessible Mathematics is a tribute to teachers by acknowledging the importance of instruction and addresses the areas of curriculum, teaching, learning, and professional growth. The author describes the roles of students, teachers, principals, administrators, and supervisors in building effective mathematics classrooms by upgrading instructional practices.",14,mtms2010-10-188a,,
"Each instructional shift Lein- wand suggests is based on classroom observation and educational research. Acknowledging that teachers already have most of the answers, the author suggests small upgrades that are both simple and powerful. One strategy is to incorporate ongoing curriculum review into every day’s lesson, such  as “What number is 1000 less than 18,294?” and “About how much is 29 and 32?” This example of a compacted review addresses estimation skills and place-value understanding; it also helps build vocabulary.",15,mtms2010-10-188a,,
"Leinwand encourages mathematics  teachers to use what works in other successful classrooms. From active kindergarten classes, we discover how to incorporate problems in context with fun activities using multiple representations. From reading classrooms, we can learn how to create language-rich classroom routines and expand students’ literal comprehension into inferential and evaluative thinking. From gifted classrooms, we can use appropriate methods for questioning students and encouraging reasoning and explanation skills. ",16,mtms2010-10-188a,,
"All ten recommendations are manageable, reasonable, and ready to use. ",17,mtms2010-10-188a,,
"Each chapter is short, about six pages per instructional shift, and packed with practical ideas. One possible, yet understandable, downside in one of his recommendations occurs when the author describes how to choose which topics to emphasize and deemphasize. His advice may be overly optimistic in the current climate of local, state, and federally mandated curriculums. ",18,mtms2010-10-188a,,
"I have used the model lesson-plan  form as well as daily activities with great success in my own classroom. For example, when I began class with a quick review and wrote “53” and “-63” on the board, I asked groups to list ideas that were similar between the two numbers. Students’ list included negative and positive, odd and even, prime and composite numbers, and other relevant vocabulary, leading to a rich and quick discussion.",19,mtms2010-10-188a,,
"I recommend this book for working teachers, preservice teachers, and teacher educators. As a veteran mathematics teacher, I am grateful for Leinwand’s vision of what we should see in an effective mathematics classroom as well as his suggestions for getting there.",20,mtms2010-10-188a,,

"The book outlines strategies, offers hints and cautions, reminds students of math notes, includes extensive examples with answers, and poses brain ticklers for further challenges.",29,mtms2010-10-188a,,
"Middle school mathematics and special-education teachers will find the vocabulary and presentation of material useful and student-friendly. Moreover, the book is well organized, technologically appropriate, easy to follow, and practical for use in the middle school. High school math teachers may find the presentation of the material too elementary.",30,mtms2010-10-188a,,
"A group of preservice secondary mathematics teachers reviewed the book during their middle school student-teaching experience. They enjoyed the use of visuals and pictures, the humor, and the additional  brain ticklers. Most felt it would be a valuable tool for a novice teacher’s resource library.",31,mtms2010-10-188a,,
"Overall, the book would be useful for teachers and students at the middle school level.",32,mtms2010-10-188a,,

Balance Benders: logic and  algebraic Reasoning Puzzles,35,mtms2010-10-188a,,
"Robert Femiano, 2010. Beginning Level, ISBN 978‑1‑60144‑225‑3; Level 1, ISBN 978‑1‑60144‑226‑0; Level 2, ISBN 978‑1‑60144‑227‑7; Level 3, ISBN 978‑1‑60144‑228‑4. 46 pp. each, $9.99 each, paper. The Critical Thinking Co.; www.critical thinking.com.",36,mtms2010-10-188a,,
"The four-book set in Balance Benders contains approximately thirty-five puzzles that are designed to help students build deductive-thinking skills and basic skills necessary to balance equations. Each puzzle is set up as an equation balance showing various objects that are equal, and students are  asked to use the information given to solve a final equation. ",37,mtms2010-10-188a,,
"Each book contains a short  introduction, balance tips, and solutions. The more difficult level puzzles include a small hint to help students begin. ",38,mtms2010-10-188a,,
"These booklets could be used with students from second grade to twelfth grade because each has a wide gradelevel recommendation. Therefore, they could be used with remedial to advanced students. ",39,mtms2010-10-188a,,
"Balance Benders meet a great need  of building deductive reasoning as well as building the understanding of balancing equations. The puzzles are designed to take between 5 to 15 minutes to solve and could be used as classroom openers, closers, or fillers without using an entire class period. However, each puzzle is similar, and some students who do not enjoy puzzles could easily become bored. Some students may have difficulty with the abstractness of the puzzles. It would be nice to have these set up, especially at the lower level, with concrete objects that students could actually touch and manipulate as they attempt to find the answer to the last balance. ",40,mtms2010-10-188a,,
"Although I did not have the  chance to use these materials in my classroom because of the time frame given for the review process, I did  ask my second-grade and eighthgrade sons to give me their opinion. Both said the puzzles were challenging and fun, but they were also  bored after the third one. I could use these materials in my classroom in various ways: as a class opener, displayed as a transparency or with a document camera, as filler material when time allows, and as an optional piece of an individually paced tiered assignment.  —Charlene Higgins, Heritage Middle School, Ringgold, GA 30736",41,mtms2010-10-188a,,
