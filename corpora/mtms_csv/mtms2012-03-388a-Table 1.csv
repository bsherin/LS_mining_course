Mathematics study in Korea adheres to a nationwide curriculum developed by the Ministry of Education. Only one set of textbooks is available for teaching mathematics in grades 1 through 6. ,12,mtms2012-03-388a,,
"Students should not only understand the meaning of fraction operations but also be able to explain why the procedures work (NCTM 2000). However, a report from the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) indicates that U.S. students do not perform as well as those in many other countries, including Japan, South Korea, and Singapore (Mullis et al. 2008). This difference can be seen by inspecting the multiple-choice word problem involving the multiplication of fractions shown in figure 1. Only 34 percent of U.S. eighth graders tested were able to correctly solve this word problem compared with 66 percent of Korean students tested. ",13,mtms2012-03-388a,,
"Research shows that many U.S. students learn fraction operations through procedure-oriented, memorybased instruction, which attributes little meaning to such operations (Kilpatrick, Swafford, and Findell 2001). NCTM (2006) asserts that instruction should emphasize a balance between mathematical concepts and procedures for student learning.

"Multiplication of fractions is addressed in the fi rst semester of grade 5. Unit 7 comprises eight lessons. The textbook analysis by Son and Senk (2010) revealed that Korean textbooks develop three different meanings of fraction multiplication as (1) repeated addition, (2) operator, and (3) fi nding a part of a part. Three different problem types are developed: whole number × fraction, fraction × whole number, and fraction × fraction. Throughout the unit, students use a three-step process:  1.

Fraction Multiplication as Repeated Addition,18,mtms2012-03-388a,,
"Korean textbooks fi rst introduce fraction multiplication as repeated addition using the problem type whole number × fraction. The meaning of repeated addition is fi rst studied in wholenumber multiplication. Students learn that 3 × 4 means “3 groups of 4 objects” (i.e., adding 4 three times). The fi rst factor (the multiplier) represents the number of groups, and the second factor (the multiplicand) tells the size in each group. Similarly, the fi rst fraction multiplication lesson asks students to fi nd 5 × 3/8 using repeated addition (i.e., adding 3/8 fi ve times). Figure 2 shows the introductory problem for the unit (Korean Ministry of Education 2002a, pp. 108−9, translated by the author), which includes a real-life situation involving pizzas. Activity 1 (see fi g. 2) asks students to determine what fraction represents 5 × 3/8 by modeling repeated addition with area models.

"The third activity asks students to apply their understanding to several fraction multiplication problems of the same type.

Fraction Multiplication as Operator,39,mtms2012-03-388a,,
"Korean textbooks next address the problem type fraction × whole number. When the multiplier (the fi rst factor) is a fraction and the second is a whole number (e.g., 3/4 × 12), students must modify it because the repeatedaddition interpretation does not make  sense. Korean textbooks address this form of fraction multiplication with the notion of “operators.” The operator interpretation means “3/4 of 12”; this computation can be illustrated by drawing 12 units (or wholes) and taking 3/4 of that entire region. Similar to the development of multiplication as repeated addition, Korean textbooks develop the operator interpretation using the same three-step process:  1.  Develop a real-life context.",40,mtms2012-03-388a,,

"First, students fi nd 1/4 of 12 on a number line by partitioning 12 into 4 groups, fi nding 3 meters in each group. Next, they determine how many are in the 3 groups as indicated by the numerator 3 in 3/4 of 12. This  interpretation and solution process require students to recognize two ideas. First, 1/4 of 12 is equivalent to 12 ÷ 4 because 1/4 × 12 is the quotient when 12 is divided into four groups on the number line. Second, 3/4 is three times as large as 1/4; therefore, 3/4 × 12 is equivalent to 3 × (1/4 × 12). The problem is also explored using set models. Figure 4 shows the two models used with the wire problem. ",46,mtms2012-03-388a,,

"According to Son and Senk (2010), this question sets up the typical meaning of fraction multiplication addressed  and developed in U.S. textbooks. Korean textbooks use an area  model to initially develop fraction × fraction multiplication. Students are asked to shade area models (i.e., a rectangle), coloring 3/4 after segmenting the rectangle vertically into 4 equal pieces and then shading 5/7 after segmenting the rectangle horizontally into sevenths. The accompanying teacher’s manual suggests that while students are completing this coloring activity, teachers lead them to focus on how the denominators relate to how the grid is partitioned and how the numerator affects the solution to the problem, as directed in fi gure 6.

Develop multiple meanings for fraction multiplication. Examine your curriculum materials. What meanings are developed? Any operation has multiple meanings. By exploring these multiple meanings, students develop a deeper understanding of what an operation entails and when it is appropriate to use. When instruction focuses only on developing procedures, the meaning associated with them (i.e., when to use a procedure) remains underdeveloped. Explore various instructional resources to become familiar with the meanings for various operations.  2. Use multiple representational models in a systemic way.",75,mtms2012-03-388a,,
"The more ways students are given to think about mathematical ideas, the better they will understand them. Korean textbooks direct students to develop three representational models (area/circle or rectangle, discrete/set,  and measurement/number line) in accordance with the different meanings and types of fraction multiplication. For any operation, it is important to use appropriate models to draw out and highlight concepts that are part of a deep understanding of that operation.",76,mtms2012-03-388a,,
3. Develop multiple computational strategies.,77,mtms2012-03-388a,,
