Make a sketch of distance (horizontal axis) versus speed (vertical axis) that shows how you think each individual will run this race and when he or she will reach his or her top speed. Explain.  5.  The top human average speed is  achieved in the 150 m dash, a race that is rarely run. The record for this race is held by Usain Bolt, who ran it in 14.35 s. What is this speed in m/s and km/h?  6.  Apart from Bolt’s times, the other records have been in place for over 15 years. What conclusion(s) can you draw from this information? 7.  These are all average speeds   over given distances. However, speeds recorded for very short bursts (sometimes referred to as  instantaneous rates) can be greater. Research the top recorded speeds.
