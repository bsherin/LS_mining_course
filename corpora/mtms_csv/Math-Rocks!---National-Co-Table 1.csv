2,Math Rocks! - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum in Cleveland, Ohio, is a 150,000-square-foot building that serves as the permanent home of rock and roll’s most memorable experiences. Designed by internationally renowned architect Ieoh Ming Pei, the building rises above the shores of Lake Erie. “In designing this building,” Pei explained, “it was my intention to echo the energy of rock and roll. I have consciously used an architectural vocabulary that is bold and new, and I hope the building will become a dramatic landmark for the city of Cleveland and for fans of rock and roll around the world.”",,
3,Math Rocks! - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Approaching the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum, you immediately see a variety of geometric shapes and dynamic cantilevered spaces. A tower supports a triangular-shaped glass “tent” that extends onto a 65,000-square-foot plaza, providing a dramatic main entry that is braced by bowstring trusses. The jury for the selection of the prestigious Innovative Design and Excellence in Architecture with Steel Award commented on Cleveland’s signature museum: “A wonderful composition of geometric volumes and shapes, as well as solid and transparent planes of materials. This composition results in a very recognizable building structure. Exuberant forms, clashing geometry, all resolved with a three bar coda of a pyramid.”",,

5,Math Rocks! - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"2. Omitting the space that includes the entrance doors, the glass “tents” are composed of square and triangular windows. Using the photograph and without counting the windows individually, how many triangular and how many square windows are present in the front triangular face of the glass tent? Explain your method, while considering an efficient way of counting.",,
6,Math Rocks! - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"3. What does it mean to make a shape twice as big? Consider the triangular wall of the tent. If we double the height of the triangle and double the length of the triangle, will that make the triangle twice as big? Explain your reasoning.",,
