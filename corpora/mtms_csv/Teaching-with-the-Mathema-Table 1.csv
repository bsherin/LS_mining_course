Recently, it has been considered a viable approach in other disciplines, including mathematics and science (Heuser 2002). With its value in mind,  we modified the literacy workshop to fit our vision of immersing learners in what it means to do mathematics. Our adaptation of the workshop model includes four key components: making connections, focus, activity, and reflection. These areas provide a deliberate structure for critical thinking. Each component is explained in detail in table 1.

The grant focused on increasing the mathematical content knowledge of a diverse group of middle school teachers.

25,Teaching with the Mathematical Practices in Mind,"After reading the question, the teachers examined assumptions and tried to understand what “more girls” meant. As they identified different ways to interpret the definition of “more,” they explored several issues: “Are we comparing 12 versus 10 girls or which class has a greater percentage of girls? If we are comparing percentages, then we need to compare 10/20 versus 12/25.” After we explained that the question could be answered either way, the teachers suggested that a multiplicative comparison would be more useful. They used fraction sense to determine that the second class had a smaller percentage of girls. They reasoned that in the first class, half the students are girls because  10 20 number of nutty candies number of candies in box",25,Teaching with the Mathematical Practices in Mind
26,Teaching with the Mathematical Practices in Mind,"Because 12/25 is less than 1/2, there are fewer girls in the second class. The teachers could analyze the givens and constraints of the problem and understand this context, so they did not need to find a common denominator or use an algorithm to compare the quantities; instead, they could use their understanding of fraction benchmarks.

In so doing, they could see and hear mathematical problem solving in action, recognize how viable arguments are constructed, and identify ways to critique the reasoning of others. Unlike a traditional lecture, a think aloud asks learners to actively engage in the demonstration by creating a record of thinking, not just actions, which they can reflect on, refer to later, and apply to their own efforts.

He presented his work on the white board. During the think aloud, the teachers actively observed and analyzed how John made sense of the problem (Practice 1) and communicated his reasoning (Practice 3). He began by trying to understand the problem by asking, “What does it mean to be nutty?”",35,Teaching with the Mathematical Practices in Mind
36,Teaching with the Mathematical Practices in Mind,"Looking for an entry point into the problem, he began considering possible approaches. “I wonder if this is another way to ask a probability problem. If I picked a candy, from which box would I be more likely to get a candy with a nut in it?” After establishing this connection, he began exploring which box had the largest ratio of nutty candies. ",36,Teaching with the Mathematical Practices in Mind
37,Teaching with the Mathematical Practices in Mind,"He first compared the rows of  candies in each box using a pictorial representation (see fig. 2). Because each box contained rows of 5 candies, he rearranged the candies in the first box, placing 2 nutty candies per row. In the second box, his rearrangement yielded two of the three rows with  2 nutty candies and the last row with 1 nutty candy. Since this row had a lesser amount, John concluded that  the second box was less nutty. He then determined how much of each box = consisted of nutty candy by writing the ratio of  10 20 number of nutty candies number of candies in box or 1/10 and 5/15, respectively. For comparative purposes, he decided to think of the ratio as a percentage. He calcaluted that 4/10, or 40 percent, of the first box had nutty candies. He thought of 5/15 as a friendly fraction of 1/3, which he knew was equivalent to 33 1/3 percent. Then, he compared 40 percent to 33 1/3 percent, confirming that the first box was nuttier. By reasoning through the problem both ways, he validated his solutions. ",37,Teaching with the Mathematical Practices in Mind
38,Teaching with the Mathematical Practices in Mind,"John then decided to solve the problem using a different strategy. He suggested duplicating, or iterating, the boxes of candy until each contained the same overall number of candies. He could then make larger boxes of candy that would have the same ratio of nutty candies as the original boxes but would be easier to compare. The first box had 10 candies and the second had 15, so he used his  “Here’s how you can solve the problem” is quite different from “this is what I thought about as I solved the problem” because a polished solution does not showcase the sense making and strategies that may be used during problem solving.",38,Teaching with the Mathematical Practices in Mind
39,Teaching with the Mathematical Practices in Mind,understanding of multiples to iterate the first box three times and the second box twice to get 30 candies in each box (see fig. 2). He found that  4 × 3 = 12 nutty candies were in the first box and that 5 × 2 = 10 nutty candies were in the second box.,39,Teaching with the Mathematical Practices in Mind
40,Teaching with the Mathematical Practices in Mind,"Since both boxes contained   30 candies total, he directly compared the number of nutty candies in each box. Finally, he represented the situation numerically, comparing 12/30 versus 10/30. He commented that because each had the same number of candies, the denominator was the same. By analyzing givens, monitoring and evaluating his problem-solving progress, making connections between different representations, and checking his answer using another method, John actively demonstrated persevering and making sense of problems (Practice 1). ",40,Teaching with the Mathematical Practices in Mind
41,Teaching with the Mathematical Practices in Mind,"To finish this portion of the workshop and connect back to the mathematical practices made visible during the think aloud, the teachers discussed what they noticed as a whole group. Many commented that they appreciated the slow pace of the think aloud because it gave them time to process what was said and process how John was thinking. Others commented that it was very helpful and different to see someone explicitly model the problem-solving process rather than  just showing steps for solving a problem. “Here’s how you can solve the problem” is quite different from “this is what I thought about as I solved the problem” because the former is a polished solution and does not showcase the types of sense making and strategies that a learner may use during the problem-solving process. ",41,Teaching with the Mathematical Practices in Mind
42,Teaching with the Mathematical Practices in Mind,"As the teachers responded to  mathematical arguments given by John, considered additional ways to solve the problem, and critiqued the reasoning of others, they were actively engaged in Practice 3. Although most of the teachers had used common denominators to compare the boxes, many had not made the explicit connection between finding a common denominator and iterating copies of the original candy boxes until they heard John’s reasoning.",42,Teaching with the Mathematical Practices in Mind
43,Teaching with the Mathematical Practices in Mind,"Additional arguments and strategies were considered, building directly from this strategy. For example, one teacher suggested making equivalent numerators and comparing the ratios (i.e., compare 2/5 versus 2/6). This strategy led another teacher to ask if this strategy of comparing numerators would always work, and a discussion ensued to explore if this conjecture was generalizable.",43,Teaching with the Mathematical Practices in Mind
44,Teaching with the Mathematical Practices in Mind,"As the teachers continued sharing their reasoning and responded to others’ ideas, one teacher conjectured  that another way to determine that 2/5 was greater than 1/3 might be  to focus on the numerators; since  2 > 1, then 2/5 > 1/3. Another teacher provided a counterexample to prove why it would not always work and commented, “Think about 2/8 and 1/2; 2 is greater than 1 but 1/2 is definitely bigger.” Through this counterexample, the teacher who initially posed this suggestion realized that her conjecture was incorrect and saw how referring back to a simpler and known example provided a strategy for testing conjectures. ",44,Teaching with the Mathematical Practices in Mind
45,Teaching with the Mathematical Practices in Mind,"This type of sharing also modeled how initial conjectures may be incorrect or partially formed. However, conjecturing is part of the mathematical process of refining and communicating thinking and understanding.
