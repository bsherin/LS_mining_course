"Leigh A. van den Kieboom and Marta T. Magiera rReasoning and sense making are at the heart of  mathematics teaching and learning throughout the K-12 mathematics curriculum (NCTM 1989, 1991, 2000). Focusing on these skills gives students the opportunity to analyze, interpret, and critically think about the mathematics they learn. Instead of memorizing procedures, students make sense of why procedures work; develop fl exibility using procedures to solve a variety of problems; analyze the relative effectiveness of a procedure for a given problem situation; and are able to make sense of, or interpret, the validity of their solutions. Reasoning and sense making are of paramount importance for teaching mathematics with understanding. ",9,mtms2012-02-352a,,
"The terms reasoning and sense making are frequently used to describe the wide range of mathematical processes that relate to one’s ability to think about and use mathematics meaningfully. Mathematical reasoning frequently denotes one’s ability to draw conclusions on the basis of assumptions and defi nitions. Mathematical sense making refers to one’s ability to critically analyze concepts, situations, and contexts and draw connections among them to other knowledge (NCTM 2000, 2009). The two terms—mathematical reasoning and sense making—are closely interrelated. ",10,mtms2012-02-352a,,
"Principles and Standards for School Mathematics (NCTM 2000) presents a compelling argument  why reasoning and sense making are essential in providing K-12 students with meaningful opportunities for learning mathematics. How can teachers help their students develop the reasoning and sense-making skills necessary to see mathematics as a sense-making discipline? One opportunity comes from actively engaging students in problem solving, encouraging them to listen and question one another (including the teacher), and justify their mathematical work. ",11,mtms2012-02-352a,,
"Exploring why aspects of one’s  mathematical point of view not only helps students develop a deeper understanding of mathematics but also helps teachers make instructional decisions. Teachers are able to cultivate their own reasoning and sense making by analyzing the thinking processes that their students use when solving problems. This article explores a professional development program in which middle school teachers solve problems, assign the same problems in their own classrooms, and analyze their students’ thinking.  algebraic thinking",12,mtms2012-02-352a,,
"For years, algebra has been viewed as a “gatekeeper” (Edwards 2000, p. 26) that prevents students from accessing higher-level mathematics. Introducing algebra-based ideas into the K-8 mathematics curriculum and focusing on algebraic thinking give students the opportunity to examine algebra-based concepts in the context of arithmetic and affords them a foundation for future mathematics. Cuoco, Goldenberg, and Mark (1996) broadly defined algebraic thinking as a useful way of thinking about mathematical content. Driscoll (1999, 2001) specified that the phrase refers to thinking about quantitative situations in ways that make relationships between variables obvious. He ",13,mtms2012-02-352a,,

Doing and undoing; 2.  Building rules to represent   functions; and 3.  Abstracting from computation. ,14,mtms2012-02-352a,,
"Through these habits, Driscoll emphasized thinking processes leading, for example, to recognizing and analyzing patterns, investigating and representing relationships, generalizing beyond specific examples, analyzing how processes or relationships change, and developing arguments for how and why rules and procedures work. ",15,mtms2012-02-352a,,
"A successful implementation of algebraic concepts at the K-8 level strongly relates to teachers’ knowledge of mathematics and pedagogy. Without a doubt, teachers need to understand the mathematics that they teach. However, teachers’ readiness for early algebra instruction often resonates with their own experiences with a “traditional” approach to algebra that emphasizes procedural understanding (e.g., knowing what steps are needed to solve an equation). These kinds of experiences limit teachers’ flexibility in thinking about algebraic concepts in a more  developmental way. Thus, teachers often reach out for ways to foster and orchestrate classroom situations in support of middle school students’ algebraic thinking. ",16,mtms2012-02-352a,,
"Teachers use their pedagogical  knowledge to identify, analyze, and interpret their students’ mathematical thinking. Examining students’ mathematical thinking requires teachers to use reasoning and sense making to uncover students’ problem-solving strategies and gain access to students’ understanding of mathematical ideas. Making sense of others’ thinking might not always be an easy task. However, van Es and Sherin (2008) have found that teachers’ ability to examine students’ thinking improves not only when teachers can identify the ideas that students reveal in their solutions but also when they use these ideas as evidence to interpret students’ mathematical thinking. The work of Sherin and van Es creates a strong argument for engaging teachers in reasoning and sense making in the context of analyzing students’ mathematical thinking.  cultivating teachers’ reasoning and sense Making We use our work with middle school teachers in a professional development program to describe the processes through which teachers foster their own reasoning and sense-making abilities. The program’s activities provide an opportunity for participants to learn how to dig deeper into their students’ solutions. They also examine how their students think about and develop an understanding of algebraic ideas. The activities encourage teachers to identify, analyze, and interpret students’ algebraic thinking. They also allow teachers to think deeply about the mathematics that their students are learning. The cycle of professional development activities includes—  1.  solving and discussing solutions to  algebra-based tasks in collaboration with other teachers; 2.  implementing the same problems  in the classroom; 3.  conducting a mini case study to analyze a selected student’s algebraic thinking; and 4.  engaging in discussions about  implementing algebra-based problems in the classroom and analyzing students’ thinking. ",17,mtms2012-02-352a,,
"Before teachers can make sense of  students’ mathematical thinking in the context of any given problem, they themselves need to make sense of that problem. Thus, the fi rst step of the cycle of activities asks teachers to solve the problem on their own. They then share and closely analyze their solutions by discussing different ways in which they organized or represented the problem information, engaged in analyzing and predicting patterns, described an algebraic rule or procedure, or critiqued the validity of arguments made to justify a solution. The teachers keep in mind the connections between the arithmetic and algebraic concepts found in the problems. From their examination of solution paths, they consider different reasoning approaches and ways of thinking that they can anticipate from students. ",18,mtms2012-02-352a,,
"The same problem is then assigned  to their middle school students, and each teacher conducts a mini case study. The teachers’ in-depth analysis of a selected student’s solution focuses on the reasoning and understanding of the algebraic concepts embedded in the task and an examination of the growth of that student’s algebraic thinking over time. ",19,mtms2012-02-352a,,
"A subsequent element of the cycle  involves teachers’ discussions in a professional development group of what they learned about their students’ mathematical thinking overall, and the selected case-study student,  in particular. This activity encourages teachers to revisit the algebraic thinking addressed in the problem as they consider the different and sometimes unexpected solutions that students provide. Discussing students’ algebraic thinking fosters teachers’ reasoning and sense making because, in a group, they examine and sometimes re-examine their students’ solutions.",20,mtms2012-02-352a,,
"We use the Flower Beds problem (see ﬁ g. 1) to discuss each of the events in the cycle in greater detail in relationship to teachers’ reasoning and sense making. When the teachers solved this problem, they determined that the council needs 402 slabs to create 100 fl ower beds. They also generated several formulas to fi nd the number of slabs needed for any number of fl ower beds, including— •  4n + 2; •  6 + 4(n – 1); and •  6(n) – (n – 1)(2). ",21,mtms2012-02-352a,,
"As teachers discussed how to pose this problem to their students, they used their own thinking about the problem to guide their conversations. ",22,mtms2012-02-352a,,
"As they prepared for classroom  implementation, the teachers shared ideas about how they could effectively launch the problem. One group emphasized the understanding of vocabulary. They discussed the possibility that some of their students might have a limited understanding of the real-world context of the problem (e.g., using words such as council, paving, and slabs). Another group of teachers expressed a concern that some of their students might experience diffi culty organizing the information in a way that was useful for discovering the regularity. Teachers’ conversations led to a rich discussion about how to scaffold students’ work in a way that helps students identify and describe the pattern and then use that understanding to write a formula.

"Several teachers suggested guiding  students toward creating a table as a way to organize the information and recognize the change in the number of slabs needed to create each additional fl ower bed. Other teachers suggested using pattern blocks to engage the students in creating the design to give them hands-on experiences and help them discover pattern regularity. In the context of solving the problem and discussing ways to implement it successfully in the classroom, the teachers also considered different strategies that one might use to reason about the problem. For example, they noticed that a student might use fi gural reasoning to examine the pattern by focusing on the fi rst full fl ower bed (6 slabs) and then continuing the pattern by adding four slabs to form each consecutive bed (see ﬁ g. 2a).

Some teachers anticipated that their  students might focus on the two slabs connecting each set of the two fl ower beds (see ﬁ g. 2b). One teacher group noticed that the students could reason about the pattern by focusing on the two initial blocks and then extending the pattern by adding four blocks for each consecutive bed (see ﬁ g. 2c).,31,mtms2012-02-352a,,
The teachers discussed how these different perspectives on the pattern could infl uence the algebraic formulas their students generate. Eliciting different ways of reasoning about the pattern would be an important part of helping them write a formula and engaging students in creating mathematical arguments to validate the different rules they might use. ,32,mtms2012-02-352a,,
"Sharing their student case studies at the subsequent professional development meeting, a group of teachers discussed the algebraic thinking that two seventh-grade students, Erik and Rodney, revealed in their solutions.  ",33,mtms2012-02-352a,,
"The teachers discussed Erik’s  reasoning, which had not been antici- pated, about numbers and operations (100 – 1 = 99; 99 × 4 = 396; 396 + 6 = 402) (see ﬁ g. 3). They also shared ideas about how they could help him go beyond a closed set of numbers and generalize the pattern to an explicit formula. Erik represented his thinking verbally as “total amount of fl ower beds - 1; answer × 4; answer  plus 6; total paving slabs needed.” The teachers discussed how his verbal representation could be linked to an algebraic representation in the form of a formula 4(n – 1) + 6. ",34,mtms2012-02-352a,,
"Rodney’s solution (see ﬁ g. 4) provided the opportunity for the teachers to think about the misconceptions some students might demonstrate  in the context of this problem. One teacher noted that, like Rodney, some students might incorrectly reason proportionally while analyzing the Flower Beds problem. Rodney’s reasoning was based on a faulty assumption that a ratio of 18 slabs to 6 fl ower beds is the same as that of x slabs to 100 fl ower beds. The teachers not only identifi ed Rodney’s reasoning but also agreed that asking Rodney to explain his formula could be a good fi rst step in helping him to reanalyze his own thinking and perhaps self-correct it.",35,mtms2012-02-352a,,
Several teachers suggested other pedagogical approaches focused on helping Rodney reason about the problem and his solution. They suggested modifying it so that a proportion would yield a fraction number answer. They discussed how asking Rodney to solve the same problem with a different number of fl ower beds could further prompt his thinking about the pattern.  iMPlications oF ProFessional develoPMent,36,mtms2012-02-352a,,
"We highlight how middle school teachers, engaged in a professional development program, cultivate their own reasoning and sense making by solving, discussing, implementing, and analyzing students’ thinking about algebra-based problems. One teacher commented on the activities:  ",37,mtms2012-02-352a,,
This [solving the problem alone and with a group] helped me to think through the problems in another way. I think because I spent time solving the problems fi rst with the teachers I learned several different ways to think about the same problem. ,38,mtms2012-02-352a,,
Other teachers explained how this work helped them focus on the thinking of their students: ,39,mtms2012-02-352a,,
I didn’t understand why we found so many solutions to one problem. I am more of the “I did it this way”  teacher. It was eye-opening to see how other people made sense of the same problem. This will help me think about my students’ reasoning and misconceptions. ,40,mtms2012-02-352a,,

"Reasoning and sense making are at  the heart of teaching and learning mathematics with understanding. Developing these abilities is important for both students and teachers. Considering a variety of solution approaches to a given problem; anticipating student thinking with a goal of planning effective classroom implementation; and examining students’ thinking to identify and make sense of students’ strategies, conceptions, and misconceptions when solving algebra-based problems facilitates teachers’ reasoning and sense making. Cultivating teachers’ reasoning and sense making through teachers’ professional development has the potential to enhance the teaching and the learning processes for students and teachers alike.",42,mtms2012-02-352a,,
