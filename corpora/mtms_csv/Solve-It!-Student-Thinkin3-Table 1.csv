Create 2 more sets that meet the same conditions as Michael’s original set of 10 cards. Examine the 3 sets. (a) How are they alike? (b) How are they different? (c) From your analysis, can you create a 4th set that   will meet all the conditions more easily than before?  tThis task required students to use  their understanding of mean, median, and mode as well as probabilities to find sets of cards that met the full list of conditions. Walter Stark, a sixthgrade math teacher, assigned this problem to his students. When he presented the task, he found that the content “naturally evoked mathematical discussion” while actively engaging his students. His students’ initial reactions to the task were varied. Some thought it would be simple; others realized that all the rules they needed to follow might make it complicated or that the number of cards they could choose might make it difficult to know where to begin. ",10,Solve It! Student Thinking: Suit Up!
11,Solve It! Student Thinking: Suit Up!,"In pairs, students soon began  discussing their discoveries. Dominick and Natasha knew that the probability of randomly choosing a spade was .2; in other words, 2 of the 10 cards had to be spades. They noted that a mean of 7.4 meant that they needed to pick cards so that 7.4 was their average. Ola said that it would be easier if one just found cards totaling 74 points, since there were 10 cards. Stark then asked them if they thought there would only be one solution. Katherine quickly answered, “No. We know from class when we worked on mean, there can be more than one way to get a mean of 7.4, but I’m not sure if other cards can be used to meet all the rules.” ",11,Solve It!

12,Solve It! Student Thinking: Suit Up!,"As students continued to work, ",12,Solve It! Student Thinking: Suit Up!
13,Solve It! Student Thinking: Suit Up!,"Samantha commented that since the median had to be 8, the fifth and sixth cards had to have an average of 8. Most students continued to work using guess-and-check strategies. They found sets of cards that met the first few criteria and then checked them against the remaining rules. Every time a group of students thought they had solved it, their solution would be placed on the SMART Board™ for the entire class to test. When a solution did not work, students used the error to help them find another ",13,Solve It! Student Thinking: Suit Up!
14,Solve It! Student Thinking: Suit Up!,Fig. 1 This work shows how two students used various criteria before applying the fact that the mean was 4.7.,14,Solve It! Student Thinking: Suit Up!

16,Solve It! Student Thinking: Suit Up!,"It took a few more class periods for Stark’s students to find several answers that fulfilled all the requirements, but the time was well spent. It gave him an opportunity to determine which students used prior knowledge and  which students needed additional instruction on some concepts. Once the class had several viable solutions, he asked students to address the second question and look for relationships among their different solutions. He said he noticed that very few students’ initial solutions included face cards. Teresa said, “It is hard to use the face cards because they are worth more ",16,Solve It! Student Thinking: Suit Up!
17,Solve It! Student Thinking: Suit Up!,Fig. 2 Paulina’s work illustrated the problem that students faced when considering that the mode was diamonds.,17,Solve It! Student Thinking: Suit Up!
18,Solve It! Student Thinking: Suit Up!,"Fig. 3 Theresa eliminated clubs entirely from her group’s set of 10 cards, thus  reducing the probability of a 10 or a club being a statistic about 10s exclusively.",18,Solve It! Student Thinking: Suit Up!
19,Solve It! Student Thinking: Suit Up!,"points. That throws off the mean and the median.” After prompting, students were able to create solutions that included face cards by simply including lower-level cards to balance the higher value of the face card. ",19,Solve It! Student Thinking: Suit Up!
20,Solve It! Student Thinking: Suit Up!,"The sample work of Stark’s students demonstrated several distinct commonalities and differences. First, virtually all the students started by drawing pictures of 10 cards and then assigning them values, which were common actions with the guessand-check model. Then, most of the students used the mean of 7.4 or a sum of 74 to help. Some work clearly showed signs of erasures, as students adjusted the values to meet the conditions. Other students, like Ola and Maria (see fig. 1), used some of the other rules first and then worked toward the required mean. Ola used the median of 8 to start and made the two middle cards 8s. Maria used the  median also, but not until she had used a king, valued at 13. It is clear that students employed different starting points to arrive at their solutions. Some used significantly more guess and check, whereas others used the clues to narrow their choices first. ",20,Solve It! Student Thinking: Suit Up!
21,Solve It! Student Thinking: Suit Up!,"Although the modal suit of diamonds was the third clue in the list, using this clue early resulted in solutions that were not viable with only one deck of cards. Paulina failed to recognize that it was impossible to have two 10 cards that were diamonds (see fig. 2). Two identical cards in the set was the most common error seen when assigning suits. Although Paulina missed this contextual issue with her solution, she did show good understanding of what it meant for the probability of a club or a 10 to be three-tenths (.3). Understanding probabilities using an “or” statement can be a little tricky for middle school students.",21,Solve It! Student Thinking: Suit Up!
22,Solve It! Student Thinking: Suit Up!,"Many students, like Theresa, just  eliminated the club cards entirely from their set of 10 cards (see   3.  We may ask two more questions, “What is the maximum number of face cards you can use? Why?” We believe that these questions may prompt students to more thoroughly discuss the mean as the balance point in the data. ",22,Solve It! Student Thinking: Suit Up!
23,Solve It! Student Thinking: Suit Up!,Each of these adaptations to the question is based on the solutions we received from Stark’s class and his reﬂ ection on their work. ,23,Solve It! Student Thinking: Suit Up!

27,Solve It! Student Thinking: Suit Up!,"Fig. 4 Some students mistakenly interpreted a 1/3 probability to mean 3 out of 10.  fi g. 3), reducing the probability of a 10 or a club being .3 down to the need for three 10s. However, a number of students also realized that they could make one of the 10 cards a club, which would still give the target probability. Maria and Ola each did this, but other students, like Paulina, used two 10 cards and then one other card that was a club. ",27,Solve It! Student Thinking: Suit Up!
28,Solve It! Student Thinking: Suit Up!,"The fi nal clue also yielded some  interesting work. Most students could easily solve this once they rewrote it, as Theresa did, to say that “one of the 3 hearts is a 3.” Others struggled with the wording, designed to make this clue a basic conditional probability item. A number of students’ work indicated that they considered the 1/3 as being 3 out of 10. For example, one student had specifi cally written that 3 hearts = 1/3 (see fi g. 4). This student’s solution originally contained a 2 of hearts and a 6 of hearts; the  solution was erased and changed to a 3 and a 5. This made us wonder if this student really understood that he or she needed to have 1/3 of the hearts be a 3. The work of this student and others provided an opportunity to discuss misconceptions about equivalent decimals and fractions as well as the wording of conditional probability statements.

29,Solve It! Student Thinking: Suit Up!,"As we reﬂ ected on the task itself,  we decided that we may add more criteria when next we assign this problem.  1.  We may require that all four suits  be present within the set of 10 cards, so that students will be unable to reduce the fi fth clue down to the need for 3 tens.  2.  We may ask for a solution that  includes no face cards and a second solution that includes at least one face card. ",29,Solve It! Student Thinking: Suit Up!
