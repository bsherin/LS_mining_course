0,"Its a Girl! Random Numbers, Simulations, and the Law of Large Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Modeling using mathematics and making inferences about mathematical situations are becoming more and more prevalent in most fields of study. When we want to generalize about a population or make predictions of what could occur, we cannot use descriptive statistics. Instead, we turn to inference. Simulation and sampling are essential in building a foundation for statistical inference.",,
1,"Its a Girl! Random Numbers, Simulations, and the Law of Large Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","This activity addresses the NCTM Standards about students using proportionality and having a basic understanding of probability to make and test conjectures about the results of experiments and simulations. This activity also addresses the Common Core State Standards for School Mathematics (CCSSM) directive about statistics. It states that students understand that statistics can be used to gain information about a population by examining a sample of the population. It also states that generalizations about a population from a sample are valid only if the sample is representative of that population. Students are to understand, as well, that random sampling tends to produce representative samples and support valid inferences.",,
2,"Its a Girl! Random Numbers, Simulations, and the Law of Large Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","This activity addresses how to estimate a theoretical probability from sample statistics when compiling an entire classâ€™s data. Students will have to figure out how to sample and how to use different tools to simulate an outcome. As the number of trials increases, the law of large numbers says that their experimental probability will approach the theoretical value.",,
3,"Its a Girl! Random Numbers, Simulations, and the Law of Large Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics",THE SCENARIO,,
4,"Its a Girl! Random Numbers, Simulations, and the Law of Large Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Suppose that a couple is to have three children, with each childâ€™s gender independent of the next and with an equal chance of obtaining a child with either gender. What is the probability that the couple will have exactly 1 girl and  2 boys in any order?",,
5,"Its a Girl! Random Numbers, Simulations, and the Law of Large Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics",SIMULATION,,
6,"Its a Girl! Random Numbers, Simulations, and the Law of Large Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Ask students how to model this situation. Give students simulation tools (coins, dice, a number spinner, a random-digit table, or a graphing calculator with a random integer function) to help in problem solving. Have students brainstorm ideas on how to model the situation using each of these tools and then have them settle on a method to use for themselves after all suggestions have been discussed in class.",,
7,"Its a Girl! Random Numbers, Simulations, and the Law of Large Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Once the students have selected a simulation method, have them run the simulation for different numbers of trials in which n = 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20. Have them tally their results and then record their values as percentages to share with the class. Monitor their work to make sure that they are sampling properly.",,

9,"Its a Girl! Random Numbers, Simulations, and the Law of Large Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Three classes of ninth-grade and tenth-grade students were taken through the â€œItâ€™s a Girl!â€ activity. By generating sets of random integers, we decided to let 0 = boy and 1 = girl to simulate a couple having three children.",,
10,"Its a Girl! Random Numbers, Simulations, and the Law of Large Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","For example, {1, 0, 1} is GBG, which is a failure as there is not exactly 1 girl, whereas the following are successes: {1, 0, 0}, {0, 1, 0}, and  {0, 0, 1}. We discussed these possibilities as a class to ensure that we got appropriate data. In my first class, I tried having the students decipher the pattern by themselves. In the second and third classes, I implicitly showed them these successes and failures, and we discussed it as a class. Some common misconceptions were that students thought that each â€œ1â€ represented a success, regardless of the other digits. Close monitoring and assistance were necessary, as well as help from other students to clarify how to record the data.",,
11,"Its a Girl! Random Numbers, Simulations, and the Law of Large Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","The next day, the experimental results were compared with the theoretical probability. Given the following possible results, where B = boy and G = girl, there are 8 equally likely combinations of which 3 work for our successful solution. Hence, our probability is 3/8, or .375, or 37.5 percent. See the sample space below with successful outcomes in bold:",,

14,"Its a Girl! Random Numbers, Simulations, and the Law of Large Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","When asked the last question in the activity, about what the students think the probability truly is, many different responses and techniques were noted. Some students averaged their percentages across the number of trials (without giving any weight to the trials themselves), and others stated that the value was approximately 30â€“50 percent, given their data. They justified the last result by saying that with more trials, the percentage would and should be more accurate. These techniques and thought processes were discussed in relation to the law of large numbers. Some sample answers are given in figures 1â€“4, which highlight misconceptions.",,
15,"Its a Girl! Random Numbers, Simulations, and the Law of Large Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics",Some students correctly concluded that the result implied taking,,

17,"Its a Girl! Random Numbers, Simulations, and the Law of Large Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics",because each probability is 50 percent but failed to incorporate the number of combinations of two boys and one girl (see fig. 1).,,
18,"Its a Girl! Random Numbers, Simulations, and the Law of Large Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics",,,
19,"Its a Girl! Random Numbers, Simulations, and the Law of Large Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics",Others concluded that their results could become more accurate with increased numbers of trials and that their 80 percent success rate for 5 trials is possible but not likely (see fig. 2).,,
20,"Its a Girl! Random Numbers, Simulations, and the Law of Large Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics",,,
21,"Its a Girl! Random Numbers, Simulations, and the Law of Large Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics",A majority of students decided to average all of their results from the trials together (see fig. 3).,,

23,"Its a Girl! Random Numbers, Simulations, and the Law of Large Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","This was a good approach, but in another response (see fig. 4), students did not account for the weights of the numbers of trials.",,

27,"Its a Girl! Random Numbers, Simulations, and the Law of Large Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics",since there was a 50 percent chance of getting either 1 boy or 1 girl and three combinations of 2 boys and 1 girl. Their result was 37.5 percent.,,
28,"Its a Girl! Random Numbers, Simulations, and the Law of Large Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","The students were shown that the values should converge to the theoretical value. The results of all studentsâ€™ trials are shown in figure 5. We discussed ways to improve the simulation by increasing the trials and repeating the results, by running it more than once per student or by having more students participate in the activity. When I assign this activity again, I will spend more time going over combinations and sample space; I will also tweak the activity sheet. I will have an increased number of trials, such as n = 25 and n = 30, to get better results.",,

It can also be adapted to more advanced courses. For  example, the binomial formula may be introduced to get the result",,
