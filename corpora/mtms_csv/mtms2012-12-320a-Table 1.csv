Ship It!,1,mtms2012-12-320a,,
"The U.S. Postal Service (USPS) allows companies to ship packages with a length plus girth measurement that is less than 108 inches. The length of a package is its longest side; the girth is the measurement around the thickest part of the package (perimeter or circumference) that is perpendicular to its len gth (see the diagram). To ship the largest volume of product using the fewest boxes, it is ideal to determine the dimensions that maximize the volume of the box for a given length plus girth.",2,mtms2012-12-320a,,
"Edited by Erik Tillema, etillema@iupui .edu, who teaches at Indiana University in Indianapolis, and Fred Dillon, dillon 314@sbcglobal.net, a math educator from Strongsville, Ohio. Manuscripts should show how math is used to solve a real-life problem, preferably in the context of one’s profession, and should be no more than 300 words.

MATH TOPICS ADDRESSED: • Analyzing length and width • Calculating volume • Applying problem solving 1.  A company makes boxes with a length of 16 inches and a length plus girth of 36 inches. a.  Find the sizes of 3 possible boxes  that the company could make. Calculate the volume of each box.,4,mtms2012-12-320a,,
4.  Assume the relationship in  problem 3 always gives the largest volume. Use this relationship to determine the largest volume for a box that the USPS ships.    b.  What relationship do you notice  5.  What other practical consider- between the volume of the box and the height and width of the box?  2.  The company decides to make a  box with a length of 12 inches and a length plus girth of 36 inches.,5,mtms2012-12-320a,,
a.  Find the box that you think will  have the largest volume.,6,mtms2012-12-320a,,
"  b.  Is the largest volume in this  problem greater than or less than the largest volume in problem 1? 3. a.  Choose 3 additional lengths. For each length, ﬁ nd the maximum volume for a box that has a length plus girth of 36 inches.",7,mtms2012-12-320a,,
"  b.  Which length gives the largest  volume? c.  What is the relationship among  the length, width, and height for the box with the largest volume?  ations might a company consider other than simply maximizing volume when making boxes?",8,mtms2012-12-320a,,
