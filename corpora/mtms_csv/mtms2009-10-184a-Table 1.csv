Personal trainer Karen Cottman has a weighty job.,2,mtms2009-10-184a,,
"Measuring weight loss is important in determining if an exercise program works, but it is not the only objective. Losing body fat and maintaining a healthy body composition are more important. Body composition consists of lean tissue and fat. The body needs a certain amount of fat for essential functions (energy, regulating temperature). Karin Cottman, a certified personal trainer in Middleburg Heights, Ohio, keeps these ideas in mind when developing workout plans and diet goals for her clients. ",3,mtms2009-10-184a,,
"Cottman knows that the number  on the scale gives you total weight but not body composition. You can be overweight but not over fat if you have high muscle mass, which is typical for many athletes. ",4,mtms2009-10-184a,,
"When losing weight, aim for lower body-fat totals. Over time, exercising may not change the numbers on the scale. This is normal if your body fat has decreased and your muscle mass has increased.",5,mtms2009-10-184a,,
