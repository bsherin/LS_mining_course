"School Algebra in the  Start of the New Century curriculum, and in many respects, it is. But as this brief history makes clear, school algebra has varied in the content taught, the purposes for which it has been included, and the students to whom it has been offered. If anything has been constant, school algebra has too often been seen as a source of difficulty and failure—a gauntlet to be run rather than territory to be claimed. At one time in the United States, algebra became no more than an elective, but that seems unlikely to happen again. Whether algebra will remain a separate course or courses, however, is unclear. In Europe and Asia, algebra is often integrated into a comprehensive curriculum that includes geometry and other branches of mathematics. Recent trends in North America suggest that algebra will increasingly be integrated into learners’ experiences earlier and more fully. If the goal of making algebra comprehensible, useful, and a pleasure to learn is to be met, teachers, researchers, and curriculum developers will have to continue working together to develop approaches to teaching ideas related to equations and functions, approaches that may differ markedly from their own experiences when they learned the subject. (Kilpatrick and Izsák 2008, p. 14)  aAlgebra entered America’s school  curriculum in the early part of the nineteenth century. Since that time, it has often been the centerpiece of educational debate and discussion. Kilpatrick and Izsák provide an excellent overview of the evolution of school algebra in the United States in “A History of Algebra in the School Curriculum,” the first chapter in Algebra and Algebraic Thinking in School Mathematics. Their insightful concluding remarks continue the call for scholarly deliberations into the nature and purpose of school algebra in the twenty-first century: ",19,mtms2009-04-452a,,

"Recently, the NCTM’s Curriculum Focal Points for Kindergarten through Grade 8 Mathematics (2006) and the National Mathematics Advisory Panel Report (U.S. Department of Education 2008) have focused on K−8 mathematics, with a particular emphasis on early algebra and algebra 1. Although these reports emanated from different charges and from diverse educational perspectives, they both address the urgent need for improving the learning and teaching of school algebra in the United States. In fact, the National Mathematics Advisory Panel (NMAP) notes this in its Executive Summary: ",41,mtms2009-04-452a,,
"Although our students encounter difficulties with many aspects of mathematics, many observers of educational policy see Algebra as a central concern. The sharp falloff in mathematics achievement in the U.S. begins as students reach late middle school, where, for more and more students, algebra course work begins. Questions naturally arise about how students can be best prepared for entry into Algebra.",42,mtms2009-04-452a,,
"These are questions with consequences, for Algebra is a demonstrable gateway to later achievement. Students need it for any form of higher mathematics later in high school; moreover, research shows that completion of Algebra II correlates significantly with success in college and earnings from employment. In fact, students who complete Algebra II are more than twice as likely to graduate from college compared to students with less mathematical preparation. Among AfricanAmerican and Hispanic students with mathematics preparation at least through Algebra II, the differences in college graduation rates versus the student population in general are half as large as the differences for students who do not complete  “Algebra is a  demonstrable gateway to later achievement”",43,mtms2009-04-452a,,
"Algebra II. Students who complete Algebra II are more than twice as likely to graduate. (U.S. Department of Education 2008, p. xiii)",44,mtms2009-04-452a,,
"The NMAP made a number of recommendations concerning curricular content, learning processes, teachers and teacher education, instructional practices, instructional materials, assessment, and research policies and mechanisms. Many of their findings and suggestions were pertinent to the learning and teaching of school algebra, such as the comments made in the tenth recommendation: ",45,mtms2009-04-452a,,
"To prepare students for Algebra, the curriculum must simultaneously develop conceptual understanding, computational fluency, and problemsolving skills. Debates regarding the relative importance of these aspects of mathematical knowledge are misguided. These capabilities are mutually supportive, each facilitating learning of the others. Teachers should emphasize these interrelations; taken together, conceptual understanding of mathematical operations, fluent execution of procedures, and fast access to number combinations jointly support effective and efficient problem solving. (U.S. Department of Education 2008, p. xix)",46,mtms2009-04-452a,,
"As we move forward in the  twenty-first century, it is imperative that all students are provided the highest quality experiences to learn important and relevant mathematics that will serve them in both their lives  and occupations. In this pursuit, it is essential that all students have the opportunity to deeply understand and appreciate the power and utility of algebra. In this focus issue, you will find articles that concentrate on interesting instructional strategies and important mathematical content within the context of algebra. The articles explore how to help make algebra meaningful and useful to students. One way to do so is by presenting problems in contexts that students can understand. Further, the articles we have chosen concentrate on the interrelations among conceptual understanding, computational fluency, and problem solving. The Editorial Panel is hopeful that this issue of MTMS will provide new insights and present ideas that you can bring into your classrooms and that will ultimately improve the learning and teaching of school algebra in America.
