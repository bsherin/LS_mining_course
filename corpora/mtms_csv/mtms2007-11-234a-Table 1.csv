"The purpose of the “Families Ask” department is to help classroom teachers respond to questions commonly asked by caregivers of their students. For each publication, a commonly asked question will be posed; a rationale for the response will be presented for teachers; and a reproducible page will be offered for duplication and distribution to parents, other caregivers, administrators, or community members— anyone involved in the mathematical education of middle school students.",3,mtms2007-11-234a,,
here is this month’s question:,4,mtms2007-11-234a,,
"My daughter has always been a great mathematics student. this year, she was placed in an algebra class. she has struggled with her homework and is now failing her mathematics tests. she now says that she is not good at mathematics because she does not understand algebra. i spoke with her teacher who told me that girls her age often go through phases. how can i help her regain her sense of confidence in mathematics?",5,mtms2007-11-234a,,
"Unfortunately, many girls still experience considerable anxiety about mathematics and, therefore, choose not to continue the study of mathematics and science beyond the required high school courses. Research indicates that a significant number of females do not pursue careers in engineering and engineering technology because they have a lack of information, do not have confidence in their mathematics abilities, receive little encouragement, and have no role models. ",6,mtms2007-11-234a,,
"Although great strides have been  made toward gender equity in achievement in mathematics in the last twenty years, an achievement gap still persists. Although many young women are interested in mathematics as they enter middle school, by the time they are ready for high school, we find that they have become less interested in mathematics and worse: Many feel that they lack the capacity to be successful in higher-level mathematics classes.  how can we support girls’ learning and confidence in the MatheMatics classrooM?",7,mtms2007-11-234a,,
Research and evaluation provide information and strategies that can help the  classroom teacher succeed in making mathematics more accessible to girls. Studies indicate that the following practices help support girls’ learning: •	 Remind girls that they can be successful in mathematics. Many girls do not trust their own instincts and may feel unsuccessful even when they are doing well.,8,mtms2007-11-234a,,
•	 Provide opportunities for team building and working in small groups. Girls have more success when they work with others to solve mathematics problems.,9,mtms2007-11-234a,,
"•	 Build communication skills. When girls work in groups, they develop skills at interacting socially. More important, they also develop and increase their use of academic and content-specific vocabulary.",10,mtms2007-11-234a,,
•	 Make relevant connections between mathematics and girls’ lives. Creating meaningful contexts for the mathematics at hand increases interest and motivation.  •	 Present female role models in  mathematics-based careers. Role  (continued on page 236),11,mtms2007-11-234a,,

If hiring a tutor is not feasible, look for free tutoring services offered through community centers, online sources, or after-school homework clubs. Ask your daughter to help you find resources that she would find helpful as well.",13,mtms2007-11-234a,,
"Talking with other parents can  create new insights, lead to new resources, and create networks of support. You may find a group of parents with similar concerns or who may have ideas that can help your daughter. ",14,mtms2007-11-234a,,
What is important is that your  daughter gets the support she needs to regain her sense of competence and confidence in her own mathematical abilities. ● yYou have already taken two important first steps. Speaking with her about her feelings and her classroom experiences helps her to identify any potential causes for her poor performance or lack of understanding of the mathematics. Speaking with her teacher can help identify classroom behavior that may affect her learning. There are a few other steps that you might take to assure that she has every opportunity to succeed. ,15,mtms2007-11-234a,,
"Talking with your daughter in a supportive way shows that you are willing to help her through any difficulties she is experiencing. She needs to know that you value her point of view. Although she still relies on you for guidance and help, at this age she also needs to feel independent and in control of her life. In addition, it is very important that she begin to take responsibility for her academic success. For example, before meeting with her teacher, you and your daughter might devise a plan of action she can take to improve her performance. Her plan may include actions she is willing to take on her own behalf, such as asking questions in class and speaking with the teacher during lunch or after school. This will help her have some control over the situation and promote self-advocacy.",16,mtms2007-11-234a,,
"Meeting with her teacher is an  important step in creating a positive outcome for your daughter’s mathematics learning. For a variety of  reasons, it is difficult for many parents to talk to teachers. This is especially true if the parents did not do well in mathematics. However, you can begin by introducing yourself to the teacher before the problem gets worse. Let the teacher know of your daughter’s academic history and her current concerns and feelings about her poor performance in mathematics.",17,mtms2007-11-234a,,
"It is important for your daughter’s success that both of you work with her teacher in creating a plan of action. It is also important that you follow up with phone calls, e-mail, or meetings with the teacher. Ask the teacher if there is a homework hotline or Web site that your daughter can use to check assignments she may not have written in her homework log.",18,mtms2007-11-234a,,
"Successful students often  study with others. Encourage your daughter to join a mathematics study group at her school or join one online. If the family budget permits, you can hire a tutor to help her. A tutor can help with short-term goals, such as understanding a concept, and can help your daughter develop effective work and  from the November 2007 issue of families ask continued from page 234 models in nontraditional career paths help girls see that others like them work in fields that they may have thought were closed to them. •	 Take extra time to explain concepts,  and listen to answers. Girls take more time to answer a question, since they generally think the whole problem through before responding.",19,mtms2007-11-234a,,
"•	 Provide ways to include girls in providing answers to questions posed. Typically, teachers respond to students who call out answers the fastest. Present a variety of ways that you wish to hear the response and find ways to ensure that all students participate in the response.",20,mtms2007-11-234a,,
"•	 Enhance effective habits of mind,  such as perseverance. Girls typically persevere but may give up on pursuing solutions if the mathematics is overly daunting or timeconsuming. Work up to longer  problems as well as to higher levels of complexity.",21,mtms2007-11-234a,,
"•	 Create a relaxed and less competitive  classroom atmosphere. Although some girls may be competitive, studies indicate that girls learn best in less competitive environments.",22,mtms2007-11-234a,,
"•	 Consider the various ways in which students learn. Not all students approach mathematics from a logical or linear perspective. Some see it in terms of patterns, others need concrete models to move around and rearrange, and others need time to reflect and consider various approaches.",23,mtms2007-11-234a,,
•	 Provide opportunities for girls to  assess their own mathematics work and to talk or write about their feelings toward mathematics. ,24,mtms2007-11-234a,,
"Acknowledge that mathematics-related stress exists and address the issues, which will create a climate of trust where students can be candid about personal  issues. What is bothering them may have spilled over into their academic lives.",25,mtms2007-11-234a,,
"On a final note, do not be afraid  to make mathematics fun. Making mathematics engaging need not reduce the rigor or complexity of the work at hand. Girls need to be engaged in challenging problem solving to best fulfill their highest capacity.",26,mtms2007-11-234a,,
