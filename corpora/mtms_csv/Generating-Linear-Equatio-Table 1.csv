The seventh-grade content standards include objectives pertaining to developing linear equations in mathematical word problems, such as “Understand that rewriting an expression in different forms in a problem context can shed light on the problem and how the quantities in it are related” (7.EE.2, CCSSI 2010, p. 49).

(Bednarz and Janvier 1996; MacGregor and Stacey 1997), especially when the word problems involve fractional relationships (van Dooren, de Bock, and Verschaffel 2010). Studies have reported that even when students write equations, the equations are often tied to given numbers, and the students do not really understand their quantitative meanings (Clement 1982; Johanning 2004; Koedinger and Nathan 2004; McGinn, Lange, and Booth 2015). Consider the problem below, which asks students to draw a picture to support their quantitative reasoning when generating linear equations.

10,Generating Linear Equations Based on Quantitative Reasoning,"During work on the Theo–Sam CD Stack Height problem, students were asked to generate equations to represent the relationship between two quantities. Think about how your students might respond when given this task. In our work with middle school students on this task, we found that some students had difficulty considering fractional multipliers on unknowns and developed additive equations such as “S = 2/5 + T ” or “T = 3/5 + S.” Other students demonstrated that they had difficulty with the reciprocal reasoning that was necessary. Evidence of this difficulty appeared when writing an equation for Theo’s stack height as  “T = 3/5 × S.” If you gave your students this problem to solve and some of your students responded similarly, how would you support students’ quantitative reasoning to help them develop correct linear equations?

11,Generating Linear Equations Based on Quantitative Reasoning,"Ways to support students’ reasoning include encouraging them to draw  a picture, use numerical examples, and relate the picture and the numerical examples to developing equations (see ﬁ g. 1).",11,Generating Linear Equations Based on Quantitative Reasoning
12,Generating Linear Equations Based on Quantitative Reasoning,"In our study, we originally intended  to ask students to use numerical examples to test their equations. However, as we probed students’ algebraic reasoning, we found that when they were encouraged to draw a picture and connect it to numerical examples, they were able to generate correct linear equations based on the understanding of the relationship between two unknown quantities. For example, when asked to write an equation for Theo’s CD stack height, one student initially wrote, “S + 3/5 = T,” saying that the 2/5 of Sam’s stack plus 3/5 would equal 1 (or Theo’s stack). To have the student test his additive reasoning, the teacher suggested a numerical example in which Sam’s stack height, S, was 10 cm. The student fi rst determined Theo’s stack height, T, using his drawn picture and reasoning (see ﬁ g. 2). ",12,Generating Linear Equations Based on Quantitative Reasoning
13,Generating Linear Equations Based on Quantitative Reasoning,"When the student was asked to  input the values, S = 10 and T = 25, in his initial equation, the student found that his equation did not create an equivalence (i.e., 10 + 3/5 ≠ 25). After having the student check his additive reasoning with the given numerical example, the teacher suggested that there were other ways to think about it besides adding something on. He introduced the idea of a multiplier such as “10 (Sam’s stack height) × 2.5 (multiplier) = 25 (Theo’s stack height).” Eventually, the student generated an equation for Theo’s stack, “5/2 × S = T ” by expressing 2.5 as an improper fraction. Here, manipulating numerical examples seemed to enable the student to evaluate the correctness of his reasoning and stimulated his intuition to make a transition from additive thinking to multiplicative thinking.",13,Generating Linear Equations Based on Quantitative Reasoning

For example, when asked to generate an equation for Theo’s stack, one student initially provided the equation x = (3/5) × y, where x represents Theo’s stack height and y represents Sam’s stack height.

33,Generating Linear Equations Based on Quantitative Reasoning,"Student 2: Because you have to take this amount of Sam’s, if Sam’s can be considered a whole, Sam’s can be considered a whole but that’s just to itself, so this [Theo’s stack height] is more than the whole [i.e., Sam’s stack height]. So it’s more than 100 percent, or an improper fraction.",33,Generating Linear Equations Based on Quantitative Reasoning

36,Generating Linear Equations Based on Quantitative Reasoning,"In this case (cf. Hackenberg 2014),  the student still did not completely change the referent from Theo’s to Sam’s stack. Instead, he used the referent unit from Theo’s stack to express the last piece of Theo’s stack. The  teacher then suggested that the student check his reasoning with numerical examples by asking, “Two 20s and one more one-fifth of 20. Does that work out for Theo’s?” The student answered, “I do not know. It could be another half [of Sam’s stack].” Here, the numerical examples seemed to challenge the student because he was unable to resolve how to treat one part of Theo’s stack height in his equation. In this situation, the teacher asked  the student how he would describe the relationship between one part of Theo’s stack and Sam’s stack height. The student answered, “A half,” and he could conceive intuitively that Theo’s stack would be 2 1/2 of Sam’s stack. Then the student checked his equation with numerical examples of 20 and 50. This helped him see structurally that 2 1/2 of Sam’s height would produce Theo’s height. Here, the numerical examples seem to have functioned as a tool, prompting him to think about the structure of the quantitative relationship as he connected the numerical examples to the meaning of algebraic notation and then to the quantitative imagery in his picture. He finally figured out that 2 1/2, or 5/2, was in a reciprocal relationship with the relationship between the quantities that he started with, 2/5.

38,Generating Linear Equations Based on Quantitative Reasoning,"As demonstrated above, drawing a picture and using numerical examples can help improve students’ quantitative reasoning. The following are pedagogical strategies and prompts for teachers to consider when helping students develop linear equations based on quantitative reasoning. Because our study (Hackenberg and Lee 2015) focused on investigating snapshots of students’ fractional and algebraic thinking through task-based interviews, these strategies and prompts are not directly from our study but are based  on insights gained from our study and suggestions from prior research on the generation of linear equations (Ferrucci et al. 2008; Kaput 1991; Kieran 2007; Koedinger and Nathan 2004; Kutscher and Linchevski 1997; Malisani and Spagnolo 2009). The prompts are aimed at activating students’ metacognition, which is defined as thinking about one’s thinking, by restating their quantitative reasoning (see table 1).

40,Generating Linear Equations Based on Quantitative Reasoning,"Students may experience difficulty generating linear equations in large part because of the emphasis on using symbolic language without understanding quantitative relationships. CCSSI (2010) has emphasized the importance of quantitative reasoning, and NCTM (2014) has encouraged teachers to use mathematical representations to develop students’ mathematical understanding. The pedagogical strategies and prompts suggested in this article will support students’ quantitative reasoning in the generation of linear equations through the use of numerical examples and visual representations. When these strategies are applied and students are encouraged to represent, discuss, and make connections among the mathematical ideas in different formats of representation for deeper mathematical understanding, they may have less difficulty writing linear equations.
