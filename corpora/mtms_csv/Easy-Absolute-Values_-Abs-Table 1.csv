0,Easy Absolute Values_ Absolutely - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"When we ask algebra students to tell us about absolute value, we usually get an answer along the lines of “something that is always positive.” Students immediately question their answer when asked about the absolute value of zero (0). Sometimes our more advanced students say that it has a V-shaped graph or mention the piecewise definition. Despite the varied answers given by our students, seldom do we hear the answer “distance from 0.” However, using distance from 0 is the perfect way to help students understand absolute-value computations. Distance from 0 also provides a foundation for solving equations and inequalities.",,
1,Easy Absolute Values_ Absolutely - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We teach a problem-solving course for preservice middle-grades education majors that includes concepts dealing with absolute-value computations, equations, and inequalities. Many of these students like mathematics and plan to teach it, so they are adept at symbolic manipulations. Getting them to think differently about a concept that they are familiar with is sometimes quite challenging.",,
2,Easy Absolute Values_ Absolutely - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"If given |x| = 4, many students are able to say, from memorization, that the value of x can be 4 or –4. However, a number line model that emphasizes distance from 0 shows why these values are solutions. To help with absolute-value equations that are more difficult, we emphasize that the absolute-value portion is being centered at 0 and that the distance from0 is 4 (see fig. 1a).",,
3,Easy Absolute Values_ Absolutely - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
4,Easy Absolute Values_ Absolutely - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The number line model is also useful in illustrating why |x| = –2 has no solution. Rather than simply saying that “the answer is always positive,” a number line model shows that distance cannot be negative.",,
5,Easy Absolute Values_ Absolutely - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The previous two equations are straightforward and easy for students to solve. However, an equation like |x + 1| = 4 provides more of a challenge when using the number line method. Of course, our students want to immediately jump into a procedural method to solve the equation, get an answer, and move on. Since we teach a problem-solving class, our goal is to have students explore alternative solutions, especially ones that are out of their comfort zone. One way to determine the solution is through guess and check. Students can substitute values of x until they find two values that make the equation true and realize that x = 3 or x = –5.",,
6,Easy Absolute Values_ Absolutely - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Although guess and check is a valid strategy, and one that is taught in our problem-solving course, using the concept of “distance from 0” and the number line makes this problem much easier to solve. The key is to understand the idea of a “new center.” Once the problem changes and is not centered at 0, students need to visualize the problem being centered at a new value on the number line. In the problem |x| = 4, we ask students to focus on the absolute-value part being centered at 0. The same is true for |x + 1| = 4, except to have the expression inside the absolute value evaluate to 0, x needs to be –1. Now that –1 has become the new center, the distance from that center is 4. This leads to our solutions of x = 3 or x = –5 (see fig. 1b).",,
7,Easy Absolute Values_ Absolutely - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"If students have studied translations of graphs, we make the connection of shifting the graph or number line one unit to the left. However, translations is a topic some of our future middle school teachers have not explored, so it is imperative for them to understand how the new center is obtained and how to explain it to their students. The determination of the new center simply asks students to find “what makes the expression inside the absolute value equal to 0.” Since they have previously focused on centering x at 0, this is not a difficult transition.",,
8,Easy Absolute Values_ Absolutely - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Similarly, the equation |x – 2|= 5 can be solved using the number line. Focusing on what it takes to make the expression inside the absolute value 0, we find that the new center is at x = 2. Since the absolute value of the expression is equal to 5, our distance from the new center must be 5, which gives solutions of x = 7 or x = –3.",,
9,Easy Absolute Values_ Absolutely - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"A foundational number-line experience will allow students to use the “rule” to obtain an answer. They can then find their answers by taking an equation, such as",,
10,Easy Absolute Values_ Absolutely - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"|expression| = number,",,
11,Easy Absolute Values_ Absolutely - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,and then setting up these two equations:,,
12,Easy Absolute Values_ Absolutely - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,expression = number,,
13,Easy Absolute Values_ Absolutely - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,and,,
14,Easy Absolute Values_ Absolutely - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,expression = the opposite of the number.,,
15,Easy Absolute Values_ Absolutely - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,They are required to show at least one solution using the number line model and also fully explain that model.,,
16,Easy Absolute Values_ Absolutely - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The problem-solving course moves quickly from absolute-value equations to absolute-value inequalities. We often ask our students if they think the same number line idea can be used. Many are skeptical because they have a vague recollection of rules that involve double inequalities and differing inequality signs. We usually take this opportunity to point out to them the disadvantage of simply memorizing rules. If they cannot completely remember the rules for solving, then are those rules really that helpful? Although this line of discussion usually gets a few laughs, quite a few students give serious thought to the usefulness of memorizing rules and algorithms.",,
17,Easy Absolute Values_ Absolutely - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"So what about absolute-value inequalities? Can the same “distance from 0 on the number line” model still be used? We usually start with a similar guess-and-check strategy to see what answers are possible and then verify our model. For example, if working with |x| < 4, we discuss values that make the inequality true and values that do not. Students point out that the answer is all values between –4 and 4. To tie the inequality back to the concepts used in solving equations, we again think of the absolute value being the distance from the center, in this case, 0. The distance from the center (0) must be less than 4. The only way to make that happen is for the values of x to be between –4 and 4, as students previously discovered (see fig. 2a).",,
18,Easy Absolute Values_ Absolutely - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
19,Easy Absolute Values_ Absolutely - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Capitalizing on our discussions with equations, students are able to work with |x – 1| < 2. The new center is at 1, and the distance from that new center must be less than 2 (see fig. 2b).Similarly, with |x + 3|< 1, the new center is at –3 and the distance from the new center must be less than 1 (see fig. 2c).",,
20,Easy Absolute Values_ Absolutely - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"At this point in the discussion, we have not mentioned any rules used to solve these inequalities or used any algebraic manipulation to obtain our solutions. Most of the time, students will point out that the solutions all seem to be between two values on the number line or that the solution region is always “sandwiched in” on the number line. Using those comments as a starting point, we move from the number line representation of the solution to a compound inequality representation. Students can now see the correspondence between the visual model and the inequality form of the solution to the original problem. When asked to develop a method for solving absolute-value inequalities of this form, students quickly come to a correct conjecture. We are careful to point out that there are other types of absolute-value inequalities that are more complicated and require different methods for finding a solution. We emphasize that our goal is to lay a foundation that our students can use once they are in a middle school classroom.",,
21,Easy Absolute Values_ Absolutely - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Since we are teaching this topic in a problem-solving course, our goal is to make sure that students can move beyond the simple solution and apply their knowledge in a context. One example is the following problem:",,
22,Easy Absolute Values_ Absolutely - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Suppose you enter a ticket lottery for a sold-out concert. Any ticket number within 25 of the number chosen will be a winner. If the number chosen is 483, what are the winning ticket numbers?",,
23,Easy Absolute Values_ Absolutely - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We find it interesting that the initial thought of many students is that this example does not relate to what we have been doing up to this point. They correctly state that to obtain the solution, you would subtract 25 from 483 and add 25 to 483 to get the solutions. When asked, students can easily graph the solution (see fig. 3a).",,
24,Easy Absolute Values_ Absolutely - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
25,Easy Absolute Values_ Absolutely - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"At this point, most students have an “aha!” moment when presented with the graphical solution and its corresponding compound inequality and asked about the connection to absolute-value inequalities. It is very gratifying to see students begin to understand the interconnectedness of mathematics and that what at first appeared to them as a straightforward addition and subtraction problem has many levels of representation. To ensure that students have made the connection, they are asked about the new center (which is 483) and the distance that a winning ticket must be within (this number is 25). They correctly write |t – 483| ≤ 25, where t represents the ticket number chosen.",,
26,Easy Absolute Values_ Absolutely - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Another application problem is the following:,,
27,Easy Absolute Values_ Absolutely - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Exam grades are represented by the inequality |g – 85| ≤ 10, where g represents grades that are possible on the exam. What are the grades in the class?",,
28,Easy Absolute Values_ Absolutely - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Since we are nearing the end of the lesson, students are quick to realize that they need to discuss the new center (85) and how close they need to be to the new center (within 10), so that they can create the number line and compound inequality solutions quickly. In the visual representation, exam grades (g) are from 75 and 95 (see fig. 3b).",,
29,Easy Absolute Values_ Absolutely - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"With these experiences, it is not difficult to translate the distance from 0 (or a new center) concept to absolute-value inequalities such as |x – 2| > 5. Student are now able to quickly point out that the new center is at 2 and then correctly suppose that the solution includes all values that are greater than a distance of 5 from the new center. Once they represent this situation on a number line, they realize that they will need a different “rule” for solving the problem algebraically and usually make a correct guess at the process (see fig. 4).",,
30,Easy Absolute Values_ Absolutely - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
31,Easy Absolute Values_ Absolutely - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"By using this approach, students gain a much better understanding of absolute-value equations and inequalities. We have many students come back to us after they begin teaching to thank us for explaining the concept in this way and to let us know that they are using it in their classrooms. By providing a conceptual foundation for the rules for algebraic solutions, our students, and in turn their middle-grades students, will be successful not only in our class but also in their subsequent teaching. For us, this is a win-win situation.",,
