1,The Mathematics of Loopy Picture Frames,"Madhavi Vishnubhotla and Mika Munakata wWe might think of folding and cutting paper as simple actions, but both can lead to interesting and beautiful mathematics. In fact, both origami (paper folding) and paper cutting have been used to promote mathematical thinking (e.g., Boakes 2009; Golan and Jackson 2009). For example, some have explored volume through origami (Georgeson 2011), and others have investigated limits through card folding (Pagni 2006). The Möbius strip, which can be considered a special kind of paper folding, leads to yet other revelations, challenging students’ spatial sense and understanding of surfaces (for examples, see Smith and House 2011; Matthews 1972; Pedersen 1968).

Content standards in geometry, expressions and equations, and measurement are also addressed.",4,The Mathematics of Loopy Picture Frames
5,The Mathematics of Loopy Picture Frames,"We present the activity as it might  play out in the classroom. The activity could take 45 to 60 minutes or one class period. Students can work individually or in pairs. Teachers should supply scissors, colored paper strips, and glue or tape. Students will need at least two strips of paper in two colors. Although students can use any size of colored strips of paper, strips that are 12 inches long and about 3 to 4 inches wide will be the easiest size to handle.

After taping the two ends of the strip to make the loop, we would have l = 2 r, which is the circumference of each  loop, with r being the radius of the loop.  2.  The area of the strip will be equal to the lateral surface area of each loop (i.e., lw = 2 rw).  3.  The cross section where the two  loops overlap would form a square with an area of w2 square units.  4.

32,The Mathematics of Loopy Picture Frames,"Therefore, the perimeter of  ABCD = 4l = 4(2 r).  3.  FP = QE = w/2, so the four shaded  corners form squares of side w/2. EF = FG = GH = HE = (l – w). Therefore, the perimeter of  EFGH = 4(l – w) = 4(2 r – w) = 4(2 r) – 4w.",32,The Mathematics of Loopy Picture Frames
33,The Mathematics of Loopy Picture Frames,"4.  The area of the painting is (l – w)2. 5.  We discuss three approaches to find  the area of the picture frame here. Students can be encouraged to find the area in other ways if possible and confirm that the area found by these different approaches is the same.  a.  Area of the frame = area(ABCD)  – area(EFGH) = l2 – (l – w)2.     b.  Consider the picture frame as  formed by the two original strips with 4 squares overlapping at the corners. The area of each square formed by overlapping loops (BPFM, CNGS, DRHO, and ALEQ) at each corner is (w/2)2 = w2/4. The area of the frame = 2(lw) – 4(w/2)2.  c.  Consider the picture frame  as formed by 2 blue strips,  2 pink strips, and 4 overlaps of pink and blue strips. Note that the two rectangles LMFE and HGNO, formed by the pink strips, are equal in area. That is,  area(LMFE) = area(HGNO) = (w/2)(l – w). Similarly, the two rectangles QEHR and FPSG, formed by the blue strips, are equal. So, area(QEHR) = area(FPSG) = (w/2)(l - w).  The pink and blue strips  overlap to form 4 squares, each with an area equal to (w/2)2. Therefore,    the area of the frame     = {area(LMFE) + area(HGNO)}        + {area(QEHR) + area(FPSG)}        + 4area(BPFM)     = 2 (w/2)(l – w)        + 2(w/2)(l – w) + 4(w/2)2.
