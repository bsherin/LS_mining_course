0,Whats In A Name_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Middle school students are intrigued when they meet someone new or find a classmate who shares their first name. Historically, some baby names have been more popular during a specific time span, whereas other names are considered timeless. The Internet article, â€œHow to Tell Someoneâ€™s Age When All You Know Is Her Nameâ€ (Silver and McCann 2014), describes the phenomenon of the rise and fall of name popularity, which served as a catalyst for the activity we presented to students. We engaged sixth-grade students in a prediction, data collection, organization, analysis, and interpretation activity by exploring the frequency of names in three generations. Students at 11 middle schools collected and submitted first name and age data for themselves, siblings, parents (or guardians), and grandparents (or other older relatives), providing a total sample of 7435 first names and ages. We posed a series of questions about predictions; popular names and their frequencies; measures of central tendency and clustering; representative sampling; and possible reasons why some names may be prevalent during particular time periods. As a culminating project, students worked in teams to design and present a business plan for a mall kiosk selling personalized name items. Our activity was implemented in a sixth-grade class taught by one of the authors.",,
1,Whats In A Name_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"This activity aligns with several Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSM) clusters in the Statistics and Probability domain for sixth grade, including Develop understanding of statistical variability (6.SP.2 and 6.SP.3) and Summarize and describe distributions (6.SP.5). Moreover, it addresses several of the Common Coreâ€™s Standards for Mathematical Practice, such as SMP 3: Construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others, whereby students, â€œreason inductively about data, making plausible arguments that take into account the context from which the data aroseâ€ (p. 7); and SMP 4: Model with mathematics, which states, â€œMathematically proficient students can apply the mathematics they know to solve problems arising in everyday life, society, and the workplaceâ€ (p. 7). NCTMâ€™s Principles to Actions: Ensuring Mathematical Success for All (2014) advocates eight high-leverage mathematics teaching practices to guide teachers in effective mathematics instruction. We believe that this activity provides a model for two of these mathematics teaching practices. First, it models Implement tasks that promote reasoning and problem solving because students were engaged in a culminating project that required them to reason mathematically and allowed for varied solution strategies. Second, it models Support productive struggle in learning mathematics as students authentically grappled with this real-life task. They were not told how to solve the problem; instead, the teacher offered support in a way that required students to do the critical thinking and struggle through the problem-solving process.",,
2,Whats In A Name_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,LESSON DESCRIPTION,,
3,Whats In A Name_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Overview,,
4,Whats In A Name_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,The framework provided by the GAISE report (Franklin et al. 2005) guided the structure of this activity. The GAISE report recommends that students engage in statistical tasks in which they (1) formulate questions; (2) collect data; (3) analyze data; and (4) interpret results (p. 11). The initial question we posed was this:,,
5,Whats In A Name_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"What are the most popular names for both males and females in three different generations (students and siblings, parents, and grandparents)?",,
6,Whats In A Name_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Data Collection Process,,
7,Whats In A Name_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"After posing our initial question, we wanted students to collect their own data and create their own data set. We also wanted to incorporate the use of spreadsheets as a data management tool, so that students could experience firsthand a situation for which technology was needed to enter and organize data in a manageable, efficient way. For popular names to present themselves as a pattern in the data, a large sample was necessary. Therefore, in addition to our own class of students collecting data, we enlisted the help of students from 10 other schools. With principals and teachers on board in our building and at neighboring schools, we had more than 1000 data collection sheets submitted, which contained a total sample of 7435 first names with corresponding ages. See figure 1 for the data collection sheet.",,
8,Whats In A Name_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
9,Whats In A Name_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"As the completed data collection sheets came in, the authors, the sixth-grade students, and another teacher took part in the data entry. A shared spreadsheet (see fig. 2) was used, which allowed students in the participating class (students had 1-to-1 Chromebooks at their school) as well as the authors to collaborate on simultaneous data entry through this shared document.",,
10,Whats In A Name_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
11,Whats In A Name_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"An edited version of the complete data, in Excel-sheet form, can be found as a more4U with this article at http://www.nctm.org/mtms.",,
12,Whats In A Name_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In addition, we wanted students to work with a data set that included subsets of data so that we could assign groups of students to different generations, which was our reason, in part, for organizing students and siblings, parents, and grandparents as different categories on the data collection sheet. The original data set contained 1997 different names with a total sample size of 7435. For the database to be manageable for students, we created a second version including only names that occurred at least twice. This brought us to 908 different names (e.g., 908 rows in the spreadsheet) with a total sample size of 6360. As a warm-up activity, students made predictions about name popularity and real-life connections using the entrance slip shown in figure 3.",,
13,Whats In A Name_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
14,Whats In A Name_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"To our surprise, students did not devise a list of names as easily as we thought they would, but they eventually arrived at reasons for the changing frequency of names as a result of popular movies (such as Bella and Jacob from the movie Twilight). One student conjectured that perhaps names from the British show Dr. Who might be popular in Great Britain.",,
15,Whats In A Name_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Data Analysis and Interpretation,,
16,Whats In A Name_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Students worked in mixed-ability groups created by the classroom teacher. Each group was assigned to focus on either student and sibling data (S), parent data (P), or grandparent data (G), which were color coded yellow, green, and red, respectively, in the spreadsheet. For example, in figure 2, row 2 contains the total number of data points for each age; therefore, cell L2 shows that 122 students and siblings were 10 years old. Using the activity sheet shown in figure 4, students gained experience working closely within the data set. Before allowing students to dive into the data, we presented several suggestions and tips for navigating the spreadsheet.",,
17,Whats In A Name_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
18,Whats In A Name_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"First, we explained to students how to read down the rows and across the columns. We showed students that highlighting a row by selecting the row number makes it easier to follow. We also picked an example name and practiced finding the mean, median, and mode age as well as the range of ages for that name. We told students that using the find command (e.g., Ctrl+F) to search for specific names could be helpful, and they practiced by testing this function with their own name. Students quickly learned how to zoom in and out on the spreadsheet. Also, because we wanted students to see what the spreadsheet looked like in its entirety and recognize the power of technology, we printed one color copy of the entire spreadsheet, hanging it on one wall of the classroom from the ceiling to the floor (see fig. 5).",,
19,Whats In A Name_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
20,Whats In A Name_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"After identifying their assigned focus group (question 1) students worked on questions 2 and 3 of the activity sheet (see fig. 4). To identify the 5 most popular male and 5 most popular female names, students diligently sifted through the names to find those with the highest frequencies. Some students zoomed in and out on the spreadsheet, jotting down names that at first glance seemed popular and then used that list to go back and examine frequencies to determine the most common names. Other students used less-efficient scrolling methods, or they started with names they personally believed would be popular. In these cases, peers often pointed students in the direction of more-efficient methods for determining the most popular names.",,
21,Whats In A Name_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Next, on questions 4 and 5, students started by listing the most popular male and female names from questions 2 and 3. To address the primary question asked in 4 and 5 about the predicted age of a person with each of these popular names, students described their mathematical strategies for their predictions. Students used a variety of solution strategies to justify their reasoning for their predicted age, including measures of central tendency, such as mean, median, mode, and a measure of deviationâ€”the range. Students also considered both the clustering and spread of data. For example, one student verbalized his groupâ€™s method for finding the most popular names by explaining that his group would start by looking for the yellow clusters on the spreadsheet, then identify the frequency of that name. If the frequency seemed high, the group would find the mean, median, mode, and range and make a determination on the basis of this analysis as to whether to include it as a most popular name.",,
22,Whats In A Name_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"See figure 6 for two samples of student work. In the first example (see fig. 6a), the student listed predicted ages and stated what measure of central tendency was used to make those predictions.",,
23,Whats In A Name_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
24,Whats In A Name_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Our review of the spreadsheet revealed that the student appeared to use the mode if he saw a clustering around a single age with most of the other ages being fairly close together. In the cases where the mean or the median was used, data did not seem as clustered; but it is unclear why median was chosen over mean for the name Matthew or why mean was chosen over median for the name Michael. In the second sample of student work (see fig. 6b), the student wrote her initial â€œguessâ€ of the average age for each name and then the actual average ageâ€”based on using the mean. Notice that sometimes studentsâ€™ predictions were very different from the mean age once they calculated it. This provided us with an opportunity to reinforce with students the meaning of the â€œmeanâ€ and that even if they found that the mean age of people named Amy, for example, was 43, that would not indicate that all girls named Amy were 43 years old.",,
25,Whats In A Name_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Several students attempted to use reasons that did not have a strong mathematical justification. For some students, their own personal experiences â€œgot in the wayâ€ of the mathematics and resulted in using justifications that were not representative of our data, as this paraphrased dialogue between one of the authors and a student shows.",,
26,Whats In A Name_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Teacher: How did you determine your predicted ages?,,
27,Whats In A Name_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Student: I wrote my predictions below for each student based on people with the same name I know in real life and their ages.,,
28,Whats In A Name_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Teacher: Thatâ€™s a great start. Do you think compared to our total sample, your predictions are representative of that? In other words, would the one or two people you know with each of these popular names be representative of the population?",,
29,Whats In A Name_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Student: No, but our spreadsheet has that information.",,
30,Whats In A Name_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Question 6 addressed the idea of using an appropriate sample, which aligns to CCSSM standards 7.SP.1 and 7.SP.2. Here, we looked for student responses that considered sample size and/or representativeness, rather than simply studentsâ€™ personal connections to peopleâ€™s names and ages. We considered the following statement to be a high-quality student response:",,
31,Whats In A Name_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I think the overall data represented a good sampling. I think this because over 7000 people were surveyed so the data will be accurate. Also, there were people from different generations.",,
32,Whats In A Name_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Although the sample was not random (it was more of a convenience sample), it was still a very large sample, which made its potential for accurate predictions stronger. Many students believed that our sample size was large enough to predict someoneâ€™s age by knowing their name, but one student did not think the sample of 7435 names was large enough. Below is a paraphrase of the conversation between one author and that student:",,
33,Whats In A Name_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Teacher: Read question 6; do you think our data represented a good sampling?,,
34,Whats In A Name_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Student: No, I do not think this a good sampling.",,
35,Whats In A Name_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Teacher: Why not? We collected a lot of data.,,
36,Whats In A Name_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Student: Yes, we collected a lot of names, but we only looked at names that repeated. The names that did not repeat at least twice were deleted. So, if we were to make our data sample larger, maybe those names that were deleted would have repeated and other names that were not as popular before would become more popular.",,
37,Whats In A Name_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Question 7 addressed the notion of whether the sample was representative of the population and was intended to build a cultural connection into this activity. Students considered whether similar names would present themselves and whether the same names would be the most popular if the same data were collected in another country. See the following student responses:,,
38,Whats In A Name_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The names would be a lot different like Mulal from China, or Miki from Japan. Or my name in Thai would probably be much less popular because Thai is not English. There could also be different death expectations.",,
39,Whats In A Name_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"One difference is that the name would be different because of culture and religion. Another difference is population because the countries have more or less than others. Also, some people die at different ages in certain counties.",,
40,Whats In A Name_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In the first student response, a student whose family is from Thailand was able to reason why his name was much less popular in the United States. In the second response, a student points out the role that culture and religion may have on the popularity of different names.",,
41,Whats In A Name_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,A Culminating Project,,
42,Whats In A Name_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Once students were well versed in working within the data set, they were ready to be introduced to the culminating project, which centered on developing studentsâ€™ skills in SMP 3: Construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others (CCSSI 2010). This project also provided an example of implementing a task that promoted reasoning and problem solving, which aligned with Principles to Actions (NCTM 2014). Students were strategically grouped into teams. Then each team drew a card at random, which assigned them to one of the following target age groups: 5â€“9, 10â€“14, 40-50, or 65â€“75. Students were charged with designing a plan for how they would stock a mall kiosk that sold items personalized with first names. To level the playing field and to keep the project manageable, given our large data set, we set parameters. Students were told that with their target age group as a focus, they could select 10 male and 10 female names to print on the personalized name items. They were also told that they could stock their kiosk with three personalized name products, which would sell for equal to or less than $5.00, $20.00, and $50.00, that would interest their target age group. In addition to these parameters, we supplied students with a copy of the checklist that judges would use to evaluate the presentations (see fig. 7) so that all criteria under consideration were clear. Students were given two class periods to work in their teams to create their plan and build their presentation.",,
43,Whats In A Name_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
44,Whats In A Name_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In their groups, students decided whether they wanted to use Google Slides, a Prezi, posters, or a combination of these for their presentation. Because Google Slides and Prezi can operate as shared documents, all students within a team could feasibly work on their presentation at the same time. Teams were given about 20 minutes to determine the 10 most popular male and 10 most popular female names in their target age group. Next, we asked students to spend about 20 minutes creating their mathematical justification argument for their chosen names. As students began to verify the mathematics (using methods such as identifying the mean, median, and mode, among others), some students realized they had not chosen the most popular names according to their justification method (such as the mean or mode), so they exchanged some of their chosen names for those that better fit their argument. To use class time wisely, students were to come to class prepared with a possible personalized name product for each of the three price ranges as well as a potential company name. Team members presented their ideas, and the team voted to quickly determine the three personalized name products and company name. Completing this part of the project efficiently allowed for more in-class time to focus on the mathematics and create the presentation.",,
45,Whats In A Name_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"On the third day, teams presented their projects using a modified (friendlier) format of the television show Shark Tank. With four parents who work in business and industry, the school principal, and the school counselor volunteering as judges, each team pitched their business plan, addressing each aspect of the presentation checklist used by the judges. After each 6â€“8 minute presentation, judges asked questions. At the end of all presentations, the judges left the room and deliberated for 10 minutes. They returned to the classroom and addressed each group, identifying a strong point and an area for improvement with regard to their presentation. Then they announced the team they most wanted to fund and their reasoning behind the decision.",,
46,Whats In A Name_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We (the authors) and the parent judges were impressed with each of the teamsâ€™ presentations and found it interesting how real-life considerations came into play as they presented not only the popular names to be personalized on the products but also the reasoning behind the three products they selected and their marketing plans. For example, one team used the Internet to conduct background research to support why those in their target age group (65â€“75 years old) would be interested in the personalized name products they selected, such as golf club covers. Another team with a 10â€“14 age group target reflected on why team members had selected a chocolate bar, sunglasses, and a sweatshirt, including that they matched their own desires.",,
47,Whats In A Name_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Next time we do this project, we will spend more time discussing the difference between the wholesale cost of the product and the retail price. Although students realized that to make a profit, they needed to sell the product for more than it costs, many had very small margins between the cost and selling price (e.g., $12.00 and $15.00). This would be an ideal time to talk with students about realistic profit margins, overhead costs associated with operating a business, and so forth. See figure 8aâ€“b for screenshots of student presentation slides.",,
48,Whats In A Name_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
49,Whats In A Name_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,EXTENSIONS,,
50,Whats In A Name_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,This activity promoted a meaningful avenue for working with a large data set through the exploration of popular names. We suggest several ideas for extending our activity.,,
51,Whats In A Name_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,â€¢ Engage students in graphical explorations as found in Silver and McCann (2014).,,
52,Whats In A Name_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"â€¢ Ask students to search their own name on Wolfram Alpha (https://www.wolframalpha.com/). Doing so may furnish students with a plethora of statistics related to their name. See figure 9 for an example search with the name Bella, which became wildly popular due to the adolescent literature series Twilight.",,
53,Whats In A Name_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
54,Whats In A Name_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"â€¢ Explore the popularity of baby names, using the Social Security baby names data set (see Loree 2015).",,
55,Whats In A Name_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,â€¢ Explore what your name would be if you were born today (see http://time.com/3856405/baby-name-popularity/).,,
56,Whats In A Name_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Students used their knowledge of statistics to collect and compile data, interpret data, and use information to develop and justify a business plan, all while using descriptive statistics and developing technology skills. Students were excited to take part in this project and â€œbe the data.â€ This activity centered on the sixth-grade and seventh-grade CCSSM statistics standards. We also asked students to engage in SMP 3 because we expected them to weigh options while working within a large data set, justify their decisions both mathematically and in relation to real-life considerations, and productively engage in discussion and argumentation from within their groups. This project provided an outlet for building community within the class and the teams, involved parents as judges, and allowed for collaboration among teachers within this school and at other schools as they helped collect data for this engaging project.",,
