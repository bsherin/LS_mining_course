0,Developing Assessment through Lesson Study - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Lesson study cultivates teachersâ€™ capacity for formative assessment by placing student thinking front and center throughout. According to Black and Wiliam (1998, p. 2), assessment refers to â€œall those activities undertaken by teachers, and by their students in assessing themselves, which provide information to be used as feedback to modify the teaching and learning activities in which they are engaged. Such assessment becomes â€˜formative assessmentâ€™ when the evidence is actually used to adapt the teaching work to meet the needs.â€ Learning to incorporate the effective use of assessment in classroom instruction is not an easy task; we suggest that lesson study (Stigler and Hiebert 1999) supports teachersâ€™ effective and frequent use of formative assessment.",,
1,Developing Assessment through Lesson Study - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Lesson study is a form of professional development in which a team of teachers determines a mathematical focus, collaboratively studies student thinking about the topic, designs a lesson about this content, implements the lesson while collecting detailed evidence of student learning, and reflects on the impact of the lesson on student learning and behavior. The lesson study process encourages careful observation and analysis of student thinking, with the goal of designing and implementing effective teacher responses to student actions. Figure 1 illustrates the phases of lesson study.",,

3,Developing Assessment through Lesson Study - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"â€¢ Study: The team of teachers determines a mathematical focus, studies the content in depth, and investigates research on student thinking about this content. The team also gathers data about their own studentsâ€™ understanding of this content and underlying concepts.",,
4,Developing Assessment through Lesson Study - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,â€¢ Plan: The team carefully plans a lesson around this content based on what they learned about student thinking in the study phase. This plan will indicate critical junctures for assessing student learning during the lesson and adapting instruction based on the results.,,
5,Developing Assessment through Lesson Study - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"â€¢ Teach/Observe: One teacher teaches the lesson while the other team members and external experts observe the lesson live and record evidence of student learning and actions throughout the lesson. Student work is collected, and the lesson is often video recorded to support evidence-based reflection.",,
6,Developing Assessment through Lesson Study - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"â€¢ Reflect/Modify: The team gathers to share and analyze the data collected, with the goal of investigating how aspects of the lesson affected student learning and behaviors, how the lesson could be improved, and what might be learned for instructional practice more generally.",,
7,Developing Assessment through Lesson Study - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Carefully observing, recording, and analyzing student actions and learning are primary components that cultivate teachersâ€™ capacity for formative assessment. These areas support teachersâ€™ ability to interpret student actions and modify instruction based on student learning and behaviors. We have learned much about the process and affordances of lesson study from the long-term intensive work of a group of about 100 teachers of grades 4â€“8; some taught only mathematics or mathematics and science, whereas others taught all subjects. For five years, the teachers participated voluntarily in a grant-funded professional development project involving intensive summer institutes, monthly seminars, and ten full days of lesson study each year. Participating teachers applied as site groups. The teachers differed in level of experience from first-year teachers to veteran teachers with twenty or more years of experience. The teachers formed eight lesson study teams, ranging in size from five to twelve, covering multiple grade levels, and including teachers from multiple schools. We illustrate the stages of lesson study, and its power to develop capacity for formative assessment, through the experiences of a representative team of fifth-grade and sixth-grade teachers midway through the project. For a more general investigation of teacher learning in lesson study, see Lewis et al. (2012).",,
8,Developing Assessment through Lesson Study - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,STUDY,,
9,Developing Assessment through Lesson Study - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"This stage begins with the teachers identifying a specific mathematical focus. The team then studies school textbooks and research on the chosen content, identifying common misconceptions or gaps in student understanding and investigating possible teaching methods. Teachers frequently devise assessments to understand how their own students conceive of concepts that underpin the target content. These assessments will become formative when the results are used in the planning phase to guide instructional design.",,
10,Developing Assessment through Lesson Study - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In this case, the mathematical focus chosen was multiplication of a fraction by a whole number, as referenced in the Common Coreâ€™s Standard 5.NF.4: Apply and extend previous understandings of multiplication to multiply a fraction or whole number by a fraction; and Standard 5.NF.6: Solve real world problems involving multiplication of fractions and mixed numbers, e.g., by using visual fraction models or equations to represent the problem (CCSSI 2010, p. 36).",,
11,Developing Assessment through Lesson Study - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The team began by reviewing the literature to identify common misconceptions. After investigating multiple sources, the team concluded that the vast majority of misconceptions stemmed from lack of conceptual understanding of multiplication of fractions. They decided to design a lesson targeting the understanding of the underlying reasoning for multiplication and when to multiply. They then evaluated several different problems as possible focus tasks for their lesson. In so doing, they modified a problem from Guiding Childrenâ€™s Learning of Mathematics by Tipps, Johnson, and Kennedy and constructed the problem (see fig. 2).",,
12,Developing Assessment through Lesson Study - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
13,Developing Assessment through Lesson Study - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"As a pre-assessment, the team piloted the problem with a group of six students from the fifth and sixth grades (from classes that would not receive implementation of the lesson) to gauge readiness and investigate what understandings, misconceptions, and struggles might surface. Figure 3 contains sample student work and team interpretations.",,

16,Developing Assessment through Lesson Study - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Planning the research lesson is heavily guided by results of the study phase, thus continuing the focus on student thinking and transforming the pre-assessments into formative assessments.",,
17,Developing Assessment through Lesson Study - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Advance planning for effective formative assessment during the lesson plays an important role in the research lesson plan. Teachers consider questions such as these:,,
18,Developing Assessment through Lesson Study - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,1.  What are key points to check for understanding during the lesson? What evidence might indicate that students are confused or are ready to move on?,,
19,Developing Assessment through Lesson Study - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,2.  How might a teacher respond to student understandings (to deepen them) and misunderstandings (to correct them)?,,
20,Developing Assessment through Lesson Study - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,The first question guides teachers in assessing development of student understanding during the lesson; the second question transforms that assessment into formative assessment by planning adaptations of the instruction in response to student actions.,,
21,Developing Assessment through Lesson Study - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
22,Developing Assessment through Lesson Study - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The lesson plan excerpt (see table 1) provides an example of how the team used their conclusions from the pre-assessment to plan initial instruction as well as formative assessment for their lesson. Additional sample checkpoints for formative assessment, based on the teamâ€™s pre-assessment observations, are shown in table 2.",,

25,Developing Assessment through Lesson Study - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In implementing a research lesson, a member of the lesson study team (the instructor) teaches the lesson; the remaining members of the team, often augmented by outside experts, carefully observe and record studentsâ€™ mathematical work, actions, and comments. These observations provide the evidence for the postlesson analysis and reflection.",,
26,Developing Assessment through Lesson Study - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The instructor has a dual assessment role during the lesson: (1) Implementing the formative assessment designed in the planning stage, and (2) noticing and responding to unplanned student actions and reactions that reveal unexpected understandings and misunderstandings.",,
27,Developing Assessment through Lesson Study - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"During the lesson implementation, similar misconceptions surfaced. In one instance, a student had difficulty understanding the meaning of the verbal description â€œthree-quarters of an hour.â€ This difficulty was expected, and the team had discussed it, so although this studentâ€™s interpretation was not one of the anticipated responses, the instructor was prepared to probe his thinking on the spot. Part of the student-teacher interaction follows:",,
28,Developing Assessment through Lesson Study - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Student: â€™Cause she was gonna work three hours and a quarter each day. Thatâ€™s why. Then â€™cause thereâ€™s seven days here, I thought if I multiply it, then I would get my answer.",,
29,Developing Assessment through Lesson Study - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Teacher: Sheâ€™s going to practice three-quarters of an hour every day, and you put down three hours and a quarter? . . . Do you think three-quarters is the same as three and a quarter?",,
30,Developing Assessment through Lesson Study - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Student: No, I think they are, â€™cause they both sound the same. . . . â€™Cause they just changed it and they put â€œand.â€",,
31,Developing Assessment through Lesson Study - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Teacher: Do you think that â€œandâ€ is important? If somebody says like, â€œHey, give me 50 dollars.â€ Somebody says, â€œHey, give me 50 dollars and 50 cents.â€ Does that make a difference in how much money?",,
32,Developing Assessment through Lesson Study - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Student: Youâ€™re adding more.,,
33,Developing Assessment through Lesson Study - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Teacher:  [In relation to the work below] If I say, â€œHey, thatâ€™s 3 dollars and 24 cents.â€ Thatâ€™s 3 dollars and 24 cents, right? What if I just say, â€œGive me three quarters.â€ How much money is that?",,
34,Developing Assessment through Lesson Study - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
35,Developing Assessment through Lesson Study - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Teacher:  I said if she practices three-quarters of an hour, you see? Itâ€™s also known as, well, itâ€™s three-quarters of an hour or three-fourths of an hour. Do you know three-fourths of an hour? [Student nods.] Yes, thatâ€™s how much she practices every day.",,
36,Developing Assessment through Lesson Study - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Student: Ooooooh! Okay. Yeah! [Smile],,
37,Developing Assessment through Lesson Study - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"An important component of formative assessment is the ability to gather evidence about student thinking while many other activities are taking place during a lesson. In a research lesson, the team members who are not teaching the lesson are tasked with observing and carefully recording moments of student learning, such as comments, behaviors, and mathematical work, to assess studentsâ€™ understanding and engagement with the mathematics. By focusing on observation only (rather than teaching) during the research lesson, a teacher-observer hones the ability to listen carefully to studentsâ€™ comments, observe studentsâ€™ actions, and discern nuances that might otherwise go unobserved. Observations, studentsâ€™ work, and often a video recording of the lesson provide the grist for the postlesson analysis.",,
38,Developing Assessment through Lesson Study - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,REFLECT/MODIFY,,
39,Developing Assessment through Lesson Study - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The postlesson analysis provides dedicated time to reflect on how well the lesson plan anticipated studentsâ€™ needs, to what extent and in what ways students benefited from the lesson, how the content might be better taught in the future, and how instructional practice can be enhanced for other content as well. This stage deepens the ability to put assessment to use and make it â€œformative.â€ By examining student actions and teacher responses away from the immediate pressure of classroom teaching, teachers are able to consider these carefully and learn how their predictions worked out in live teaching, to what extent the lesson responded to anticipated and unanticipated student needs, and how future instruction might incorporate formative assessment more effectively.",,
40,Developing Assessment through Lesson Study - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Teachers begin by examining evidence collected during the research lesson: student work, notes from observations, and video or audio of the lesson, if available. They ask questions regarding studentsâ€™ understandings, conceptions, learning, and engagement. Some excerpts of observations and conclusions are shown in table 3.",,
41,Developing Assessment through Lesson Study - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
42,Developing Assessment through Lesson Study - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Teams throughout the project had increased the cognitive complexity of problems given to students. We see a reflection of the difficulty of this task in this teamâ€™s struggle to find an appropriate level of complexity: It must be sufficient so that students engage in productive struggle but not so complex that they are unable to engage with the problem. The safe and relaxed environment of reflection in lesson study also allowed the team to ask what opportunities they might have missed, both in lesson design and in its implementation. Collaborative reflection around these questions and potential modifications of the lesson support teachersâ€™ inclination and ability to ask themselves similar questions in the flow of teaching and to adapt instruction based on their answers.",,
43,Developing Assessment through Lesson Study - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,PLACING STUDENT THINKING FRONT AND CENTER,,
44,Developing Assessment through Lesson Study - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Lesson study slows down the process of teaching, providing time and support for teachers to examine their practice in depth and to develop new skills in a supportive environment. Student thinking is placed front and center during all phases of lesson study: in researching how students think about the content; in the research lesson and implementing it; and in postlesson collaborative examination of student work and behaviors (Lewis et al. 2003). All phases of lesson study offer teachers opportunities to develop their skills for formative assessment:",,
45,Developing Assessment through Lesson Study - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"â€¢ In the study phase, teachers learn about studentsâ€™ conceptions and misconceptions related to particular content;",,
46,Developing Assessment through Lesson Study - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"â€¢ In the planning phase, teachers use this information and carefully consider how students might respond to the tasks, at what points and in what ways teachers might check for understanding, and how they might then adapt instruction;",,

48,Developing Assessment through Lesson Study - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"â€¢ In the reflection phase, the team collaboratively examines student work and behaviors to consider how instruction of this content as well as other content may be enhanced in the future.",,
49,Developing Assessment through Lesson Study - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The project teachersâ€™ comments overall reveal a growing inclination to assess studentsâ€™ knowledge routinely, so that they can design and adapt instruction. Their comments also reflected the need to listen carefully to studentsâ€™ comments and ideas in pre-assessments and during instruction. As one teacher explained, â€œBe sure to assess and assess and assess and allow students to share their ideas so we can address misconceptions.â€",,
50,Developing Assessment through Lesson Study - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Teachers developed the habit of questioning assumptions, reflecting carefully, and interviewing students purposefully:",,
51,Developing Assessment through Lesson Study - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,The interviews helped me see that there are many areas that can become misconceptions. Is it due to language? Teaching? Childâ€™s own learning style? Learning issues?,,
