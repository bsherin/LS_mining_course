The process of developing deﬁ nitions is underemphasized in most mathematics instruction. Investing time in constructing  meaning is well worth the return in terms of the knowledge it imparts.,3,mtms2012-09-92a,,

"Ashley L. Dickey, and Maxwell S. Arb ooOne core practice of mathematicians that is underemphasized is the activity  of deﬁ ning, which ties into making sense of problems and constructing viable defi nitions by offering and refi ning ideas through discussion. With the adoption of the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics, much attention will be placed on the eight Standards for Mathematical Practice that precede the general content. The dispositions that teachers should foster in their students as they learn mathematics together are outlined in these eight Practices. The fi rst is “Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them” and the third is “Construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others” (CCSSI 2010, p. 6). Asking students to build defi nitions could be included in both the aforementioned practices.",5,mtms2012-09-92a,,

"In the classroom, when teachers present math vocabulary words at the beginning  or during a unit, they typically ask students to write the defi nitions in their notebooks. Students then learn the concepts embodied in the defi nition after the words have been introduced. A second approach to teaching defi nitions engages students with the concept fi rst and then presents the vocabulary term as a way to name it, after students have created meaning for it. This type of defi ning is called descriptive because it involves describing an already known mathematical idea (De Villiers 1998).",7,mtms2012-09-92a,,
"Although we have used this second approach in a majority of our instruction,  we present here a third approach to defi ning, called constructive. It involves modifying students’ previous understanding of a term and creating a new idea (De Villiers 1998). A set of tasks that we used with our eighth-grade students helped them create a class defi nition for interior angles. We will show that using constructive deﬁ ning opened up opportunities for students to create more meaningful strategies for fi nding their own formulas for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon.",8,mtms2012-09-92a,,

"All four of us were teaching a standard eighth-grade prealgebra course in a suburb of Orlando, Florida. These classes comprised, among other groups, both English language learners and economically disadvantaged students. Many students were below grade level in mathematics according to the Florida state test.",10,mtms2012-09-92a,,
"The teachers participating in this study met during the year to discuss student reasoning and its implications for instruction. We decided that before students learned to create their own formulas for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon, we should fi rst have students defi ne interior angles. We knew that the meaning of the word interior would be problematic for many students and felt that the best way to create its mathematical defi nition would be through student debate. We also wanted students to learn that they can and should play a role, with the teacher’s guidance, in defi ning terms in math class.  a seRies oF iMages",11,mtms2012-09-92a,,
"On the fi rst day of instruction, we told students that over the next two or three days we would be defi ning the term interior angles by discussing a series of shapes. We would write their ideas on the board, and the students would be free to add to, delete from, or modify any of these ideas as the images changed. ",12,mtms2012-09-92a,,
"A Triangle In a corner of the board, we wrote the phrase interior angle and then showed students a scalene triangle (see fi g. 1a).",13,mtms2012-09-92a,,
Students claimed that either 3 or 6 interior angles were found in that image. We then asked students to come to the board to mark the 6 angles (see fi g. 1b).,14,mtms2012-09-92a,,
Although we expected students to  mark the 3 angles at the vertices of ,15,mtms2012-09-92a,,

Several explained that “the sides are 180 degree angles so they should be called interior angles.”",16,mtms2012-09-92a,,
"Under the term interior angles on  the board, the teacher wrote these student comments: •	 Angles	that	make	the	corners •	 Angles	can	be	180	degrees",17,mtms2012-09-92a,,
We then asked if students were  satisfi ed with the defi nition so far or if they wanted to delete or change any of the characteristics. One student wanted to delete the second ,18,mtms2012-09-92a,,
"Fig. 1 In counting interior angles, some students found 6, as indicated by the marks in (b).",19,mtms2012-09-92a,,
"How many interior angles do you see for the triangle below? (a) Original triangle (b) Students’ marks characteristic because “we learned last year that the angles of a triangle add up to 180 degrees, so if you count the three 180 degrees that you marked, you’re already bigger than 180 degrees.”",20,mtms2012-09-92a,,
"Other students, including those  who argued for 6 interior angles, agreed and said that although those three lines did indeed measure 180 degrees, it did not make sense to count them as interior angles. With students’ permission, teachers deleted the second criterion and replaced it with “sides not included.”",21,mtms2012-09-92a,,
"A Parallelogram The next shape shown to students was a parallelogram that was specifi cally not a rhombus. Students’ answers oscillated between 4 and 8 interior angles, but 8 was rejected because students remembered that they had agreed to discount 180 degree angles. Then we presented a parallelogram with one diagonal, as illustrated in fi gure 2.",22,mtms2012-09-92a,,
"Students found 4, 6, and 8 interior angles. We color-coded each enumeration to express different student answers. The answer of 4 interior angles was indicated in red; 6, in green; and 8, in both red and green. Students readily accepted counting 2 green angles and 1 red angle at each diagonal corner and refi ned their defi nition to include these statements: •	 Angles	that	make	the	corners •	 Sides	not	included •	 There	can	be	more	than	1	angle	in	 a corner",23,mtms2012-09-92a,,
A Pentagon,24,mtms2012-09-92a,,
"A pentagon with no diagonals was shown next, and students found only 5 interior angles. However, when we pointed out a pair of diagonals from one vertex, students responded with 5, 9, 12, and 14 interior angles (see fi g. 3).",25,mtms2012-09-92a,,

If students counted 12 angles, they generally counted all 5 angles (as if no diagonals were present), then at vertex B and C, 2 more apiece were found for the smaller ones that comprised the entire vertex angle. Angle A contained 3 angles. For 14 angles, students counted the same 12 as before, but angle A comprised 2 more angles, as shown in the fi gure. ",36,mtms2012-09-92a,,
A Rectangle with Diagonals,37,mtms2012-09-92a,,
Students did not change their defi nition at this point because all solutions fi t within the characteristics they had  defi ned so far. We then presented the rectangle in fi gure 4 that has two diagonals. Students refi ned the class defi nition after much debate.,38,mtms2012-09-92a,,
"The student responses to this  problem were quite varied and ranged from 4 to 20 interior angles. The angles formed at the intersection of the diagonals produced a new criterion. Although these are indeed interior angles, and students saw them as such, they are not considered interior angles of the rectangle. They are in the interior but are not part of the rectangle itself. Our students did not see this distinction at all and therefore unanimously included these statements as part of their defi nition:  •	 Angles	that	make	the	corners •	 Sides	not	included •	 There	can	be	more	than	one	angle	 in a corner •	 Angles	inside	the	shape",39,mtms2012-09-92a,,
A Rectangle,40,mtms2012-09-92a,,
"At this point, we could have revealed this distinction to the students and told them that the angles formed by the intersection of diagonals were not considered interior angles. Instead we chose to show more fi gures in the hopes that students would revise their defi nition themselves. We then presented the series of rectangles in fi gure 5, one at a time, asking students to determine the sum of the interior angles. The students unanimously agreed on 360 degrees for the fi rst rectangle because 4 multiplied by 90 degree angles resulted in 360 degrees.",41,mtms2012-09-92a,,
"Some students argued that the interior angles sum to 360 degrees versus 540 degrees. Students who answered 540 degrees double counted 90 degrees (as 60 degrees and 30 degrees) on each of the corners of the diagonals (see fi g. 5b). However, other ",42,mtms2012-09-92a,,

The students then pointed out that those who answered 540 degrees actually counted 90 degrees twice at the two vertices that included the diagonal  (90 degrees, 60 degrees, and 30 degrees) but that you only count them once. They concluded that the answer, whether a diagonal or not, was still 360 degrees.",51,mtms2012-09-92a,,
"Figure 5c provoked the most discussion and led to a change in the class definition of interior angles. Some students determined that the sum was 360 degrees; others argued that it was 720 degrees by counting the additional angles formed on the interior of the rectangle (2 were 120 degrees and 2 were 60 degrees). Those who believed that the sum was 360 degrees contended that a rectangle’s interior angles always sum to 360 degrees, as with figures 5a-b. Students who found 720 degrees countered that the angles formed by the diagonals were “interior,” as well. ",52,mtms2012-09-92a,,

Follow-up activities,56,mtms2012-09-92a,,
"Students’ engagement in the constructive act of defining interior angles of polygons took approximately three class periods. We did not realize the value of the time spent on definitions until we posed the Table It! activity in class (see fig. 6). Before working on this activity, students had been creating triangles inside polygons to find the sum of the interior angles. Much of the focus in our eighth-grade classroom emphasized linear relationships and tables to help students create meaning for graphs and equations. In the Table It! activity, we anticipated that students might draw on this meaning to invent a formula for the sum of the interior angles. ",57,mtms2012-09-92a,,

Both these methods created 4 triangles, and students recognized the pattern of 2 fewer triangles than the number of sides. For example, if the polygon had 6 sides,  6 - 2 triangles—or four 180 degree triangles—were formed. So they wrote the formula (n - 2)180 = s.",70,mtms2012-09-92a,,
"For the Center Method, students started at what they perceived to be the center of the polygon and drew lines to each vertex, thus creating n triangles (in this case, 6). They noticed that whatever polygon they tried, they always got the same number of triangles as sides; hence, 180n. However, they recognized that these  6 triangles formed angles that could not be considered interior angles defined by our class definition. Those  6 angles in the center, which measured 360 degrees in total, should be subtracted from their total for a formula of 180n – 360 = s.",71,mtms2012-09-92a,,
"Students who had used the Table Method were now able to interpret their y-intercept of –360 as the 360 degrees that had to be removed from the Center Method’s polygon. In addition, when grading the assessments for this unit, we discovered that the Center Method was the most popular choice for finding the sum of the interior angles of a polygon. Students commented that the Center Method was easier because “all you need to find is how many sides the polygon has and multiply it by 180. Just don’t forget to take away the 360 degrees.” closing ReMaRks",72,mtms2012-09-92a,,
"We are convinced that the formula s = 180n – 360 would never have been invented by students unless we had taken three days to create a class definition for interior angles. The constructive activity of defining alleviated students’ natural confusion about why we do not count all angles as interior, even though they lie on the interior of  the polygon. In addition, students’ defining led to three different strategies for inventing a formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon, one of which was most notably the Center Method. ",73,mtms2012-09-92a,,
"Although constructive defining takes more time than simply giving students a definition, we contend that it is time well spent. Constructive defining not only allows students to create meaning for their mathematical activity but also opens up opportunities for students to invent various strategies that might not have been possible without the discussions that occurred while defining. A teacher may be unable to engage students in defining every topic in mathematics, but he or she can decide which topics are worthwhile and start folding the task of defining into the school year. ",74,mtms2012-09-92a,,
"If we are to place significant emphasis on the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics and its Mathematical Practices, the act of defining should become part of the mathematical dispositions of middle school students. Defining not only leads to deeper meaning but also moves students to the center of mathematical reasoning. The activities reported in this article took about three days to complete. The next word engagement, however, took significantly less time. Students created a meaningful, acceptable definition of parallel in only one day. Learning to define constructively might take a few days the first time that teachers and students engage, but it can become a regular part of classroom practice without losing crucial amounts of curricular time.",75,mtms2012-09-92a,,
