From the perspective of the students, much of the mathematics in robotics remains embedded.

"What if every middle school student learned to create a robot in math class? What if every middle school had a robotics team? Would students view mathematics differently? Would they have a different relationship with technology? Might they see science and engineering as fields driven by innovation rather than memorization? In my experience, robotics provides a compelling context for engaging students in STEM like no other. As  students find themselves faced with open-ended problems that demand creativity as well as precision, they experience firsthand how mathematically informed decisions contribute to the quality of their robot, not to mention its functionality.

"experiment with simple structures, such as creating a chassis, as well as other attachments, such as arms and claws, many will initially build quadrilaterals that lack stability, like those shown in figure 1. Teachers can ask students to experiment with strategies for making their structures more rigid. Students will often try parallel bracing initially, only to discover that this does not make the structure  more stable. However, those who use triangular bracing will get a different result (see fig. 2a). Students can then make conjectures about what gives any structure stability. In the LEGO MINDSTORMS NXT environment, students often discover Pythagorean triples. Note that the triangular bracing in figure 2b uses a 3-4-5 combination, whereas figure 2c shows an example of a 5-12-13 right triangle, ",19,mtms2013-02-340a,,

"Experimenting with sensors affords even more opportunities to use mathematics. The LEGO MINDSTORMS NXT comes with multiple plug-in sensors as well as a data-logging feature that can be used without any knowledge of programming. All sensors connect directly to the NXT brick, the brain of every LEGO MINDSTORMS robot. The simplest is the touch sensor, which works like a button. It closes a circuit when pressed, making it useful as a stop button for moving parts or to stop a robot when it hits an object (a wall, for example). The sound sensor enables the robot to hear and react to sound; it measures and records noise levels, as well. The color sensor allows the robot to detect light and color, making it possible to follow a line or a path on the ground.",22,mtms2013-02-340a,,
"The NXT also comes with three interactive servo motors, each with a built-in rotation sensor, giving the robot the ability to move and to know how far it has traveled. The integrated unit can measure the rotation of the motor, accurate to the nearest 2 degrees, ensuring that a robot moves  with precision (see fig. 3).",23,mtms2013-02-340a,,
"Before the start of any program- ming, students can try different wheels and display the rotation measure on the NXT brick to experiment with the relationship between wheel size and distance traveled in a single rotation (see fig. 4).",24,mtms2013-02-340a,,
"The last sensor in the kit, and arguably the most technologically advanced, is the ultrasonic sensor, which lets a robot measure distance to another object and react to movement. This sensor even looks like a pair of eyes with which the robot can “see” (see fig. 5).",25,mtms2013-02-340a,,

They might talk about the role of wheel size in this calculation (see fig. 7).

FIRST robotics,33,mtms2013-02-340a,,
"For more than twenty years, the nonprofit FIRST® (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) has worked to informally transform  interest in learning more. Ultimately, this interest will lead to students writing programs, which is where the mathematics can really come alive. For example, suppose that students wanted their robot to launch via a clap, roll forward 10 inches, make a 90 degree right turn, continue rolling until it hits a black line, and stop. They would need to break this seemingly simple procedure down into smaller steps, which they can “teach” the robot, through programming (see fig. 6).",34,mtms2013-02-340a,,

Founder Dean Kamen calls these events “Olympics for the mind.” Although FIRST ’s early programs targeted high school students, Kamen (an inventor and innovator, who created the Segway® transporter) quickly recognized the potential benefi t of involving students at an earlier age. The result was FIRST LEGO® League (FLL®)—a partnership between LEGO and FIRST, now international in scale, involving thousands of teams every year, each team composed of up to ten students in fourth through eighth grade. Many FLL teams are based in schools, either as after-school programs or as part of the STEM curriculum. Others are located in youth organizations such as Boys and Girls Clubs or Girl Scouts. Many middle school teachers start teams at their school. ",39,mtms2013-02-340a,,
