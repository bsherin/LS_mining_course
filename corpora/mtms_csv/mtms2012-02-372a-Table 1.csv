"Fostering algebraic thinking is an important goal for middle-grades mathematics teachers. Developing mathematical reasoning requires that teachers cultivate students’ habits of mind (Driscoll 1999). Teachers develop students’ understanding of algebra by engaging them in tasks that involve modeling and representation (NCTM 2000). Because middle-grades students often perceive modeling and representation as abstract concepts (NCTM 2000; Schoenfeld 1992), teachers must carefully design tasks that help students understand and value modeling and algebraic representation. As they help students understand the roles that modeling and representation play in mathematical reasoning, they also help  students move from a concrete to an abstract or symbolic understanding of mathematics.  the valUe of classrooM teachers as researchers",6,mtms2012-02-372a,,
"Students benefi t when classroom teachers draw on learning theory and educational research for their lessons and instruction (Constas and Sternberg 2006). Although learning theory and educational research provide a basis for developing important research questions, teachers’ fi rst-hand classroom experience and desire for direct feedback from students can become entry points for important research questions, as well. Teachers play a unique role in designing relevant research questions because they possess “a kind of knowledge that can be secured only in the context of practice itself. This is a context to which teachers have access, and it is one that can inform the views of theoreticians” (Eisner 2003, p. 653). Both theory and practice play important roles in developing research questions. ",7,mtms2012-02-372a,,

"This study was designed to investigate how students’ ability to reason algebraically through modeling and representation was affected when they were asked to create word problems involving their personal interests. Using a case-study method described by Creswell (2007), I interviewed students to gain in-depth knowledge into how this activity affected their understanding of how equations and inequalities can be used to model and  represent real-world phenomena.

"The goal was to see how an  open-ended assignment that allowed students to make choices affected their conceptual understanding of algebraic representations. Open-ended assignments in mathematics, like the activity used in this study, encourage students to draw on their creativity and imagination and develop their problem-solving skills (Becker 1997; Dyer and Moynihan 2000). Allowing students to make choices on the basis of their interests nurtures their inner motivational resources and supports their intrinsic motivation (Reeve and Halusic 2009).

"The assignment asked students to write five word problems that involved solving equations and inequalities (see the sidebar) and to use content that reflected their interests or hobbies. By creating word problems, students had to use higher-order thinking skills (Anderson et al. 2001). ",26,mtms2012-02-372a,,

The focus of the summary explored how the project helped students better understand mathematics, particularly the algebraic concept of equations and inequalities used to model and represent real-world phenomena. They also shared one of their word problems with the class. The presentation gave students experience in using appropriate mathematical language to explain why they chose the topic for their problem and how they solved their equation or inequality. They concluded their presentations with a question-and-answer session, which often generated student-led discussions about related algebraic concepts. (See table 1’s rubric.)",29,mtms2012-02-372a,,
