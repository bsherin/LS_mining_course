But how can teachers determine the authenticity of a problem that will allow students to model and analyze a situation mathematically?",,

4,Linking LEGO and Algebra - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We developed the LEGO Pets activity (see the activity sheet at the end of this article) in which students model a real-world problem situation, first concretely and then abstractly. We taught the activity in three sixth-grade classes in an affluent suburban district as well as in one sixth-grade and one seventh-grade class in a much less affluent suburban district. Approximately thirty students were in each class.",,

Sometimes they needed no scaffolding to answer the questions; at other times, minimal scaffolding; and a few times, extensive scaffolding.",,

7,Linking LEGO and Algebra - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"When students were asked to use LEGO bricks in math class to assemble a dog and a duck, they had no problem seeing how many pieces were needed or how to build them. We started the activity by asking students what they thought the aim of assembling dogs and ducks would be. Common answers included how many animals one can build with the available pieces, how to make more animals, how to get more pieces, what to build with the available pieces, and how much profit the LEGO Pets Company can generate. At this stage, we were using these questions to help students identify the variable quantities in the problem: the number of ducks and the number of dogs to build. Later, these variable quantities were linked to algebraic variables with tabular, spreadsheet, and symbolic representations of the problem.",,

9,Linking LEGO and Algebra - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"While students were doing LEGO constructions, we asked them to track the combinations in a table that we provided. Our goal was to help students think about the relationships between the variables by using a table representation. The only combinations that one group found were  2 ducks and 1 dog, 3 ducks and 0 dogs, and 0 ducks and 2 dogs (see  the first three rows in fig. 2).",,
10,Linking LEGO and Algebra - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"When we asked about building  2 ducks and 0 dogs, one student stated that the group â",,
11,Linking LEGO and Algebra - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We first asked students to discuss with their partner how it is possible to know, without doing any calculations, which combination would generate more profit. Later, during a whole-class discussion, many hands were raised. One student stated that the LEGO Pets Company would need to worry only about the combinations that could produce the most pets, which was 3 in this case. As a class, we decided to work with 3 ducks and 0 dogs and 2 ducks and 1 dog. Comparing these two combinations, one student explained that in both cases we could build 2 ducks, but building 1 dog would generate $3 more profit than building another duck. This discussion helped students analyze the relationship of the quantities to make a decision. After a similar discussion, each class easily determined that the maximum profit was $57, which came from building 2 ducks and 1 dog:",,

13,Linking LEGO and Algebra - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We next introduced the idea of  sensitivity analysis, which is the  process of analyzing a solution to see how sensitive it is to small changes in the parameters of the problem. In this situation, we asked what would happen if we had one more large or one more small piece. Many groups told us that another large piece would  not help because they would need  2 additional large bricks to build either animal. Before we had a chance to ask, students told us that having one extra small piece would help; it would allow them to disassemble a duck and build a dog in its place.",,

15,Linking LEGO and Algebra - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In the other class, we needed to scaffold the discussion to help students see the no-more-than-$3 philosophy. We then introduced the term marginal value, which is the value of an extra unit of a resource. We also shared the fact that Leonid Kantorovich and Tjalling Koopmans, who discovered the concept of marginal value independently, won the 1975 Nobel Prize in Economics for their work (Nobelprize.org 2014).",,

18,Linking LEGO and Algebra - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The LEGO Pets Company has had some success, so it decides to make more animals. To allow the company to make more animals, it has decided to have 16 large and 31 small bricks available.",,
19,Linking LEGO and Algebra - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"First, we asked students if they would want to build the ducks and dogs by hand. The students adamantly answered â",,
20,Linking LEGO and Algebra - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Students were able to make sense of the spreadsheet and connect its elements to the context of the problem. Students in all classes saw that 2 large and 4 small or 2 large and 5 small represent the number of bricks needed to make a duck and a dog, respectively. They also saw that 18 and 21 represented the profit (in dollars) on each LEGO pet and connected the term objective function with the objective of the problem: to generate the most profit possible. We showed them how an ExcelÂ® spreadsheet worked, and they wanted to see the formulas. When we clicked on a formula cell, all cells involved in the calculation were highlighted, which students liked.",,
21,Linking LEGO and Algebra - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Spreadsheet formulas can be used to introduce an algebraic representation. For example, we pointed out how the spreadsheet formula,",,

25,Linking LEGO and Algebra - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"where x represents the number of ducks made, y represents the number of dogs made, and P represents the total profit. We believe that this approach could be used in an eighth-grade class with the idea of strengthening the sophistication of the model by extending it from a table to an algebraic representation.",,

28,Linking LEGO and Algebra - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"At this point, the students decided that 4 ducks and 3 dogs with a profit of $135 was the solution that generated the greatest profit.",,
29,Linking LEGO and Algebra - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"When we asked students to  consider the effect, if any, on the  solution of having an additional large or small piece, all students in each class saw that one additional large piece would not help. Each duck and each dog required 2 large bricks. However, in one whole-class discussion, students tried 0 ducks and  7 dogs, 11 ducks and 0 dogs, and  8 ducks and 0 dogs when given one extra small piece. With the 8 ducks and 0 dogs, one extra small piece added $9 to their profit. In another class, some groups that did not find the 8 ducks and 0 dogs combination were surprised by the solution when they worked with their own laptops. Indeed, because it involved making none of the more profitable item, the solution was somewhat counter-intuitive.",,

31,Linking LEGO and Algebra - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The technology also made it possible to introduce an algebraic approach.

33,Linking LEGO and Algebra - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"This activity met the criteria for an authentic task and a modeling cycle. In particular, the context of the LEGO Pets activity provided clear connections to the real world. We spent nearly an hour on one problem identifying variables and relating those variables; we then asked students to determine a solution by reasoning and decision making, not by calculating. This discussion necessitated significant investments of time and intellect.",,
34,Linking LEGO and Algebra - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"During the activity, students did not need to use information from multiple sources, but they were required to take more than one perspective: their own and that of a business manager. The work clearly allowed students to collaborate in pairs or larger groups. The activity also required finding a solution, validating the solution, and interpreting that solution in the context of the problem. Moreover, the sensitivity analysis, asking students to consider whether one extra large or small piece would change the solution and what that value would be, goes far beyond interpreting results often found in textbook examples.",,
