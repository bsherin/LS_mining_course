0,Polygon Area and Perimeter (November 2014) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"1. Draw, to scale, a triangle, a rectangle, and a trapezoid that all have the same area. This is your first set of polygons.",,
1,Polygon Area and Perimeter (November 2014) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"2. Find the perimeter of each of the polygons you drew. Are the perimeters the same or different? If they are different, which polygon has the smallest perimeter? Which polygon has the largest perimeter?",,
2,Polygon Area and Perimeter (November 2014) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"3. Draw, to scale, another triangle, rectangle, and trapezoid that all have the same area. This second set of polygons should have an area different from the area of the first set.",,
3,Polygon Area and Perimeter (November 2014) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"4. Find the perimeter of each of the polygons in the second set. Are the perimeters the same or different? If they are different, which polygon has the smallest perimeter? Which polygon has the largest perimeter?",,
4,Polygon Area and Perimeter (November 2014) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,5. Do you get the same results for the perimeter relationships in the first and second set of polygons? Why or why not?,,
5,Polygon Area and Perimeter (November 2014) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,6. Make a conjecture based on your findings. How could you test your conjecture?,,
