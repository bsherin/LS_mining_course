0,Invention Activities Support Statistical Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Students experiences with statistics and data analysis in middle school are often limited to little more than making and interpreting graphs. Although students may develop fluency in statistical procedures and vocabulary, they frequently lack the skills necessary to apply statistical reasoning in situations other than clear-cut textbook examples. This led us, a classroom teacher and a university researcher, to redesign a twelve-day statistics unit to give our sixth-grade students opportunities to apply statistical reasoning to meaningful problems, make sense of messy data, deal with uncertainty, and interpret results within context. To guide our redesign, we turned to the GAISE Report, the Guidelines for Assessment and Instruction in Statistics Education (Franklin et al. 2007), which proposes a framework for learning statistics as an investigative problem-solving process rather than as a set of disconnected formulas and graphs. This active process includes formulating questions, collecting data, choosing and applying appropriate methods of analysis, and interpreting results.",,
1,Invention Activities Support Statistical Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We describe the development and implementation of our redesigned unit and explain why we chose to structure the unit around investigating the effectiveness of an online fraction game. Our students are incredibly invested in gaming and technology, and we knew they would be eager to analyze whether those tools helped them learn. The topic also allowed each student to develop a subquestion that he or she was interested in investigating.",,
2,Invention Activities Support Statistical Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Since the process of conducting a statistical investigation described in the GAISE report naturally aligns with learning through investigating real-world problems, we conceptualized the unit as a project-based learning (PBL) experience. We also scaffolded the unit with multiple inventing tasks to support the development of statistical reasoning throughout the project. In these tasks, students were asked to generate their own procedures for solving novel, ill-structured problems.",,
3,Invention Activities Support Statistical Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,STATISTICS AND PROJECT-BASED LEARNING (PBL),,
4,Invention Activities Support Statistical Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In the past, we have introduced statistical concepts through activities in which students collect and analyze data about themselves (e.g., height, length of name) or use data from a textbook. Although these activities can be engaging, we suspected that asking students to investigate a real-world problem might be even more meaningful. The key components of PBL as described by Krajcik and Blumfield (2006) closely align with the GAISE reports (Franklin et al. 2007) recommendations for developing statistical literacy. Both PBL and statistical investigations involve defining a problem, selecting a process to solve the problem, carrying out that process, and summarizing and interpreting the results. Using technology and collaborating with others play important roles in supporting learning; in PBL, creating and sharing representations of their learning during a statistical investigation can also be exciting and motivating.",,
5,Invention Activities Support Statistical Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,INVENTING TASKS,,
6,Invention Activities Support Statistical Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"An inventing task is a novel situation that supports the development of statistical reasoning. Students are presented with a statistical question (e.g., Which set of test scores is higher?) and multiple datasets. Then they work with their peers to invent a strategy for answering the question. Discussing and comparing their methods prompt them to draw on prior knowledge and notice critical features of the concepts to be learned (Roll, Aleven, and Koedinger 2009). Although students may or may not develop a successful method during the inventing process, attempting to complete the task will prepare them when they are subsequently presented with the concept (Kapur 2012). Rather than guiding students toward a correct solution, the teachers role is to encourage them to communicate their ideas and prompt them to determine for themselves whether or not their strategies make sense (Schwartz and Martin 2004).",,
7,Invention Activities Support Statistical Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Following the inventing activity, teachers provide explanations of the concepts. At this point, students are better prepared to make sense of the new material. Roll, Aleven, and Koedinger (2009) found that these tasks are particularly effective in the middle grades for students who are learning about measures of central tendency, graphing, and variability.",,
8,Invention Activities Support Statistical Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,LAUNCHING THE PROJECT,,
9,Invention Activities Support Statistical Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The classroom teacher invited the researcher to visit her classes and explain how she studies the way digital games help students learn math. The researcher asked the sixth-grade students to help her evaluate the effectiveness of a free, online fraction game called Refraction (University of Washington 2013; Martin et al. 2012). The students were immediately drawn to the context because of their interest in games. Inviting the researcher to visit the class was exciting and created a more authentic setting for the project. In lieu of collaborating with a researcher, teachers could select a game that their classes had played and discuss whether or not they believe the online game helped them learn.",,
10,Invention Activities Support Statistical Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The first three class periods of the unit were dedicated to conducting the learning experiment and gathering data. On day 1, students took a pretest and survey, which assessed their understanding of fractions, how much they liked math, and how frequently they played video games. On day 2, they played Refraction with a partner. On day 3, the students took a posttest and survey. The postsurvey assessed how much they enjoyed the game and how well they liked working with their partner while playing the game. This generated a rich dataset with several variables, allowing each student to select his or her own unique statistical question to investigate.",,
11,Invention Activities Support Statistical Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"After completing the posttest, we led a whole-class discussion on the projects driving question, Does the game help students learn? This question was revisited several times throughout the project as the students got deeper and deeper into their investigation. Over time, the students answers to this question became more complex and incorporated more evidence; however, in the initial discussion, their responses involved their personal experiences playing the game. Some believed that the game was effective; others were wary. Ultimately, it was determined that data were needed to draw more reliable conclusions. The students examined all the different data collected (see table 1) and concluded that the best way to determine whether the game was effective was to compare the pretest and posttest scores.",,
12,Invention Activities Support Statistical Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
13,Invention Activities Support Statistical Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,EXAMINING THE DATA,,
14,Invention Activities Support Statistical Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"On day 4, we presented the students with a table including each students pretest and posttest score from all four classes. To prepare for the first inventing activity, we asked students to examine the scores and make observations. This step allowed students to draw on their intuition, an important step for setting up an inventing activity (Roll, Aleven, and Koedinger 2009). Some students observed that the minimum score of 5 on the posttest was higher than the minimum score of 4 on the pretest. Others noticed that more people earned the maximum score of 14 on the posttest than on the pretest.",,
15,Invention Activities Support Statistical Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Once again we posed the driving question, Based on what you see here, did the game help students learn? Again, the class was divided. Many students determined that it was too hard to tell by just looking at the table of numbers. They suggested that it would be easier to compare the data if they were represented visually.",,
16,Invention Activities Support Statistical Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,INVENTING A METHOD TO DISPLAY NUMERICAL DATA,,
17,Invention Activities Support Statistical Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We asked each student to create a visual of the data, which resulted in a wide range of representations (see  fig. 1). Many students chose aspects of traditional charts or graphs, but some were completely unique.",,
18,Invention Activities Support Statistical Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
19,Invention Activities Support Statistical Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,We selected a variety of representations to discuss as a whole class. Comparing and contrasting different representations can draw attention to important conceptual ideas and highlight different features of the data. The following questions were meant to elicit new insights:,,
20,Invention Activities Support Statistical Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,How are the data represented in this graph?,,
21,Invention Activities Support Statistical Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,How are these two representations the same? How are they different?,,
22,Invention Activities Support Statistical Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,What do you notice about the way the data are distributed?,,
23,Invention Activities Support Statistical Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,What might have caused the data to look like this?,,
24,Invention Activities Support Statistical Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"When it comes to representing data, McGatha, Cobb, and McClain (2002) found that middle school students tend to focus on creating representations with correct physical features (i.e., deciding if the bars should be horizontal or vertical) rather than on understanding the meaning of the representation. Therefore, in our discussion, we focused students questions on the reasoning behind their use of different kinds of representations.",,
25,Invention Activities Support Statistical Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"On day 5, we began with a formal explanation of different ways to describe the shape of a graph. We introduced the ideas of the spread of the dataset; clusters or gaps in the data; and symmetrical, skewed, and uniform distributions.",,
26,Invention Activities Support Statistical Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,INVENTING MEASURES OF CENTRAL TENDENCY,,
27,Invention Activities Support Statistical Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"After describing the shape of a graph, we planned to introduce measures of central tendency. Although using graphs is one way to analyze data, we also wanted students to consider how a single statistic could represent a dataset. Mokros and Russell (1995) found that students typically have under-developed understandings of measures of center. They suggested that students be given opportunities to work with datasets and develop and articulate their own ideas about what comprises a typical value. This led us to our second inventing task. We asked students to invent a method for choosing one number that best represented a dataset and then apply this method to both the pretest and posttest data.",,
28,Invention Activities Support Statistical Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The students invented a variety of strategies to determine values representing the pretest and posttest data. The most common strategy, employed by 52 percent of the students, was finding the number that appeared most often, which is the mode. Mokros and Russell (1995) indicated that students who select the mode as a typical value are often not taking all the values in the dataset into consideration. They struggle with choosing one number that represents all the data because they have trouble conceptualizing data as an aggregate group. Because of this, we challenged students who selected the mode to invent another approach to finding a representative value.",,
29,Invention Activities Support Statistical Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The second most common strategy, undertaken by 25 percent of the students, was to calculate the mean. Students often apply the algorithm to calculate the mean with little understanding of how or why it works (Mokros and Russell 1995; Watson 2007). Thus, we challenged these students to articulate their reasoning behind their procedure.",,
30,Invention Activities Support Statistical Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The remaining students used a variety of strategies, including the median, a combination of the range and the mode, and the minimum or maximum value.",,
31,Invention Activities Support Statistical Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Watson (2007) found that presenting alternate responses to problems about measures of center and allowing students to discuss and debate them can lead to deeper levels of understanding. Therefore, we selected several students strategies and used them as the basis for a class discussion. The following questions allowed students to consider the various characteristics of each method:",,
32,Invention Activities Support Statistical Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,What strategy was used to obtain this value?,,
33,Invention Activities Support Statistical Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Does the distribution of the data impact the value obtained by this strategy?,,
34,Invention Activities Support Statistical Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,How are these two strategies the same? Different?,,
35,Invention Activities Support Statistical Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Which strategy produces a value that best represents the entire  dataset?,,
36,Invention Activities Support Statistical Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,We ended the discussion by examining the mean in further depth. The classroom teacher demonstrated the meaning of averaging as a leveling process. Columns of blocks of different heights were leveled off so that the height of each column was the same. The students then made connections between this demonstration and the algorithm for computing the mean.,,
37,Invention Activities Support Statistical Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"At the end of the class, we revisited the driving question by comparing the measures of central tendency describing the pretest and posttest. In our dataset, the mean, median, and mode of the posttest were each higher than the corresponding values for the pretest, leading many students to conclude that the game was effective. However, the difference between each pair of values was not large, which then elicited a debate of how different the values needed to be. Some students suggested that the spread of the data needed to be taken into consideration, laying the groundwork for future exploration of variance and standard deviation.",,
38,Invention Activities Support Statistical Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,INVESTIGATING STUDENTS QUESTIONS,,
39,Invention Activities Support Statistical Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"On day 6, we summarized the process used to determine if the game was effective: asking the question, developing a hypothesis, collecting data, representing and analyzing the data, and summarizing the results. Many students had suggested that several factors could impact how much students learned. Perhaps the game was effective at teaching certain students but not others. We asked each student to develop and answer his or her own statistical question about the game. The results of their investigations would eventually be shared with the original game designers so that they would have a better sense of how Refraction was and was not meeting students needs.",,
40,Invention Activities Support Statistical Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"To help students understand what qualified as a statistical question, we presented a variety of questions about the game (e.g., Which was your favorite character in the game? How many levels did students typically solve in the game?), some labeled as statistical and some not. From these examples, we asked each class to determine what made a question a statistical question. Students decided that a statistical question can be answered by collecting data and that it had a variety of possible answers. Each student used this new understanding to formulate his or her own statistical question of personal interest that could be answered with the collected data.",,
41,Invention Activities Support Statistical Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The students then stated their hypotheses and identified the specific data they would need to answer their question. At this point, we introduced spreadsheets as a tool that would allow students to work efficiently with their data. The classes had access to Chromebooks for their spreadsheet and summary work. Each student  imported the dataset into a spreadsheet and calculated the statistics needed to answer his or her question. They then created a visual representation of their data using the chart features. Finally, they made sense of their results by creating a summary report. These summaries were then shared with the game developers who created Refraction.",,
42,Invention Activities Support Statistical Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,VIEWING STATISTICS AS A POWERFUL TOOL,,
43,Invention Activities Support Statistical Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We developed this unit with the goal of creating a learning experience in which students applied statistical reasoning to problems with meaning and worked with real data, rather than with pared-down datasets from a textbook. Throughout this project, it became evident that the students learned to view statistics as a powerful tool that they could use to answer meaningful questions. While reflecting at the end of the project, students repeatedly mentioned that they enjoyed working with real data and helping out on a real project. The students contrasted this project to typical work from a textbook. One student said, In the book, the hypothesis is usually correct. That didnt always happen here.",,
44,Invention Activities Support Statistical Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The use of inventing activities was especially important in helping students see themselves as having valuable mathematical ideas. These activities built their confidence in their ability to devise strategies for solving novel problems, which was an essential attribute when students began asking and answering their own individual questions about the data.",,
