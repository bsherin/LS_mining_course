Lischka mMiddle-grades teachers and students can  have different perspectives on the value of discussing students’ mathematical mistakes, despite various classroom evidence that such discussions can help foster strong conceptual understanding (Boaler 2016). Some teachers consider student mistakes to be an opportunity to correct errors in individual student thinking. Others view the public inspection of mistakes as an opportunity for all students in the classroom to learn.  ",4,Examining Mistakes to Shift Student Thinking
5,Examining Mistakes to Shift Student Thinking,"Although both of these perspectives take students’ learning into account, our students often regard their own mistakes in a very personal manner. They see mistakes as flaws for which their teachers will judge them. ",5,Examining Mistakes to Shift Student Thinking
6,Examining Mistakes to Shift Student Thinking,"Because of the variety of perceptions regarding the value of mathematical mistakes, it is imperative that teachers consider how to leverage mistakes during classroom instruction. Are all mistakes created equal? How do we choose which mistakes are worthy of inspection? What exactly is the purpose of inspecting student mistakes? Is it simply to correct faulty answers? How should we use these mistakes during instruction? Reflecting on our teaching practice in light of these questions can lead to helpful insights. It is our hope that by considering the pedagogical quality of the mistakes examined in the classroom, both students and teachers will deepen their understanding of the value of mathematical mistakes for learning.",6,Examining Mistakes to Shift Student Thinking
7,Examining Mistakes to Shift Student Thinking,"We begin with a statement by  former NCTM President Linda Gojak: “Helping students to learn from their mathematical mistakes can give  us insight into their misconceptions and, depending on our instructional reactions, can enable them to develop deeper understanding of the mathematics they are learning” (Gojak 2013, para. 4). A number of classroom tools are available that take advantage of this powerful idea, including setting up classroom norms that value mistakes (Boaler 2016); planning and selecting tasks to elicit mistakes (Bray 2013); helping students focus on and discuss mistakes in meaningful ways (Pace and Ortiz 2016); and assessing and designing responsive instruction based on student mistakes (Barlow  et al. 2016). The purpose of this article is to add to this set of tools a list  of criteria for determining which student mistakes are worthy of class examination. As we discuss the criteria, we offer insight into why certain mistakes are worthy of inspection and how teachers might leverage their examination to shift students’ mathematical thinking forward within the context of a specific mathematics lesson. Our criteria are aimed at supporting the learning of each and every student, not just those who made the initial mistake.",7,Examining Mistakes to Shift Student Thinking

10,Examining Mistakes to Shift Student Thinking,"Merely drawing attention to and correcting errors in calculation does not typically have a large pedagogical payoff for a deep learning of mathematics. Therefore, what kinds of mistakes might be worth inspecting so that students’ mathematical thinking is moved forward in the learning process? Some mathematics education literature (Barlow et al. 2016; Kilpatrick, Swafford, and Findell 2002; NCTM 2014) provides guidance for deciding which student mathematical mistakes might be worthy of closer inspection. On the basis of this literature and our own experiences inspecting mistakes in classrooms characterized by students sharing their mathematical thinking and discussing their different solutions to nonroutine, rich mathematics problems, we offer the following criteria for choosing inspection- worthy mistakes: 1.  The mistake is closely aligned with the mathematical goals of the lesson.",10,Examining Mistakes to Shift Student Thinking
11,Examining Mistakes to Shift Student Thinking,"2.  The mistake provides powerful insight into students’ conceptual understanding, fluency with procedures, or competence in selecting strategies for problem solving.  3.  The mistake aligns well with the  class’s general progress toward solving the problem.  4.  The mistake offers a viable answer that may be contrary to the class’s accepted solution or solution strategies because of hidden assumptions about the problem (e.g., the student interpreted the problem differently than intended).

13,Examining Mistakes to Shift Student Thinking,"The remainder of this article describes how we applied these criteria  to select mistakes for class inspection during a lesson with preservice teachers addressing a task designed for sixth- and seventh-grade students. The task focused on understanding ratios and percentages, and it elicited mistakes in the preservice teachers’ work that were similar to those that might be expected from students at this grade level. For this lesson, we used a problem involving mixing paint, presented in the next section, as the central problemsolving task.",13,Examining Mistakes to Shift Student Thinking

Katie wants to paint her bedroom a special shade of purple made up of equal amounts of pink and powderblue paint. To make the pink paint for this mixture, she combines one part red paint with one part white paint. To make the powder-blue paint, she mixes three parts blue paint with one part white paint. Finally, to make the purple paint, she mixes equal parts of the pink and powder-blue paints.",18,Examining Mistakes to Shift Student Thinking

22,Examining Mistakes to Shift Student Thinking,"An equally important goal in  our implementation of the Purple Paint problem was to allow each  and every student in the classroom access to the rich mathematics embedded in the task. This access is required to produce mathematically meaningful mistakes that address the important concepts of the problem and support students in generating new mathematical understanding. For English language learners and other students who might struggle with reading or processing the task, we offer two suggestions:  1.  In addition to posting the problem in a place where all students can read it, plan to read the problem aloud, physically demonstrate the actions involved in the   problem, and offer appropriate translations. To ensure that students understand the intent of the task, ask them to revoice the problem while working in pairs, and then select a student to explain to the whole class what he or she thinks the problem is asking.  2.  Consider the technique of Delaying the Questions (Barlow et al. 2017) to provide students an opportunity to make sense of the problem’s underlying relationships before introducing the specific questions that they will be addressing. The Purple Paint problem is ideal for this technique because it contains a problem stem that introduces the relationships between each of the paint mixtures prior to the problem’s questions. When students are allowed time to consider the ratio relationships ingrained in the problem stem, they will be  much better prepared to apply their understanding of these  relationships to the remainder of the problem.",22,Examining Mistakes to Shift Student Thinking

24,Examining Mistakes to Shift Student Thinking,"After introducing the problem, the teacher, who is also the lead author of this article, asked students to take a minute or so to think privately about how they might solve it before moving into groups of four to negotiate a solution. As students worked, the teacher circulated among them, observed their approaches, asked advancing questions, and considered which mistakes might produce an impactful whole-group discussion.

30,Examining Mistakes to Shift Student Thinking,"As groups of students began to complete the task, the teacher collected the sample in figure 2 and displayed it via the document camera to be inspected by the class. Small groups were asked to compare the work with their own findings, focusing on how they had represented each of the mixtures in the problem. As students discussed this representation, several important ideas emerged and were shared with the class. One group agreed that the representations for the pink and powder-blue paints were correct by themselves but suggested that they had to be adjusted to show equal amounts of these mixtures in the purple mixture. A second group added that this would require either doubling the number of units used in the pink paint or halving the number used in the blue. Another group observed that the units in the representation were quarts of paint, and because the final amount of paint called for in the problem was equivalent to eight quarts, only doubling the number of units in the pink paint would actually give this amount. Through this process, students were able to shift their thinking to understand more deeply the idea of scaling a quantity based on its part-to-part relationship, a  critical idea in solving problems with ratio reasoning.",30,Examining Mistakes to Shift Student Thinking

32,Examining Mistakes to Shift Student Thinking,"The teacher selected the second mistake for inspection (see fig. 3) because it aligned with criteria 1, 2, and 3. This work contained an error in procedural fluency related to the conceptual error in figure 2. Although the students who produced this work showed evidence of reasoning correctly on the first part of the problem, they calculated percentages for the subparts and assumed that those transferred directly to the larger whole. This procedural mistake was not only in line with the lesson’s goal but also aligned well with the class’s general progress toward solving the problem. In addition, this particular mistake was pervasive throughout the work of several groups.",32,Examining Mistakes to Shift Student Thinking
33,Examining Mistakes to Shift Student Thinking,The teacher directed students  to consider this work in their small groups and then report on what they noticed. The resulting whole-class discussion focused on the meaning of percentage. Several students questioned the validity of their peers’ claims that the white paint comprised 75 percent of all the paint when the work could also be interpreted as showing that the white paint made up 3 out of 8 parts  of the whole. Other students noted that it was unreasonable to say that red paint comprised 50 percent of the paint and at the same time claim that white paint made up 75 percent of the paint because this sum was greater than 100 percent without accounting  for any of the blue paint. ,33,Examining Mistakes to Shift Student Thinking
34,Examining Mistakes to Shift Student Thinking,"The benefit of selecting a  mistake based on criterion 3 was  evident when students reflected on how the percentage error related to the previous discussion of the size of the parts compared with the whole (see the discussion of fig. 2).

36,Examining Mistakes to Shift Student Thinking,"Sometimes after a class has come to some conclusions about the solution to a problem, it can be beneficial to challenge their thinking. It was for this purpose that the teacher selected a final sample of student work (see fig. 4) on the Purple Paint problem according to criteria 1, 2, and 4. The students who produced this work showed a solution that contained dramatically different percentages from those that had been reported by most of the class. It appears that these students used reasoning similar to that of the students who presented the work in figure 2 on the ratio portion of the problem, believing the purple paint mixture to comprise one part red paint, two parts white paint, and three parts blue paint. Although this reasoning was incorrect, the process they used to determine the percentages of the purple paint mixture was appropriate.

43,Examining Mistakes to Shift Student Thinking,"If mistakes are minor, isolated cases and do not align well with the mathematical goals of the lesson, it can be diffi cult for a teacher to use them in a whole-class inspection with the goal of helping each and every student learn mathematics deeply. Often these mistakes are better addressed with brief one-on-one interactions with the student that do not detract from the lesson’s primary mathematical goals. These kinds of mistakes occurred while students worked with the Purple Paint problem:  •  Mistakes in calculation, such  as errors in performing long division.",43,Examining Mistakes to Shift Student Thinking

47,Examining Mistakes to Shift Student Thinking,"In figure 5a, we see the work of a  group of students who correctly determined that 3/8 of the purple paint was white but incorrectly stated that 3/8 was also the percentage of white paint. In figure 5b, we see the work of students who treated the powderblue paint as if it were pure blue paint and failed to include any white paint in their representation of the powder-blue portion of the purple paint mixture. Finally, in figure 5c, we see a representation in which the students incorrectly labeled two quarts of the pink paint blue instead of white. In these cases, the teacher can help students pay attention to their mistakes individually and move toward a solution that is aligned with the lesson goals by asking these one-on-one questions of each group: “What do you mean that the percentage of white paint is 3/8? Is there another way you can state this?” “Have you represented the white paint in the powder-blue paint? Why might this be important as you answer the problem?” and “I see that you have the pink paint made up of red and blue paint. Is that what you intended?” ",47,Examining Mistakes to Shift Student Thinking

49,Examining Mistakes to Shift Student Thinking,"Figure 6a displays work indicating that the students incorrectly carried out a procedure to determine the percentage value for a given fraction. Figure 6b displays work in which it is unclear how the students determined the percentages based on the number of parts identified. In each case, a teacher can help students individually move forward by asking such questions as “What do you mean by 400?
