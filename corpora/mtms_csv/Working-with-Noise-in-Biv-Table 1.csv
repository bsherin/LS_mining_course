Looking at the graphs, approximately how long do you think one would have to study to get an 80 on each test? How long to obtain a score of 100? Now, put yourself in the position of a student who has not yet studied best-fit lines. How would you make predictions for each data set? What unique difficulties might you have with each one?

6,Working with Noise in Bivariate Data,"The graphs shown in figure 1 differ in the amounts and types of noise they contain. We use the word noise to refer to statistical variability.  Statistics has been characterized as “the study of noisy processes—processes that have a signature, or signal, we can detect if we look at sufficient output” (Konold and Pollatsek 2002,  p. 260). The graph shown in fi gure 1a has a more pronounced linear “signal” than the others. The fi gure 1b scatterplot has a similar amount of noise, but it also contains a different type of noise—a data point that diverges  a great deal from the otherwise linear signal portrayed by the other points. Figure 1c is the noisiest of the three, but one might still be able to discern a linear signal after a close examination. ",6,Working with Noise in Bivariate Data

16,Working with Noise in Bivariate Data,"We taught seven one-hour weekly sessions during the summer. During the fi rst two sessions, students used spaghetti strands to represent bridge beams and used pennies in a cup to represent the weight on a bridge (Kroon 2016). The cup had holes cut on either side near the top to allow for the insertion of several spaghetti strands. Students found how many pennies it would take to break one spaghetti strand and then conducted several more trials, adding a strand each time. The number of strands was one variable, and the number of pennies was the second variable. Rebecca and Shonice created a poster ",16,Working with Noise in Bivariate Data

21,Working with Noise in Bivariate Data,"One of the spaghetti-bridge data  sets used for class discussion is shown in fi gure 3. After seeing the scatterplot, Shonice and Rebecca said that it reminded them of a connect-the-dots pattern. Shonice went up to the board where the graph was displayed and motioned how she would connect the dots to one another; students’ initial inclination was not to fi t a straight line to the data to discern the trend. We did not correct students at this point to tell them they should fi t a straight line rather than connect the dots. Our goal was for the straightline representation for “signal” to emerge naturally, as students made  sense of data sets, rather than having the tool imposed on them by the teachers.",21,Working with Noise in Bivariate Data
22,Working with Noise in Bivariate Data,"To see straight-line patterns in  bivariate data, students must perceive the data as being one entity, or an aggregate, rather than just a series of individual points (Bakker and Gravemeijer 2004). The “noisiest” point in the fi gure 3 scatterplot, at (6, 684), helped us draw students’ attention to the aggregate. We asked students what a good name for the point would be. Some of the names they gave it were “outcast,” “outsider,” and “outof-order.” In response, we introduced the formal term outlier and drew an oval around the main cloud of points, leaving (6, 684) outside the oval. We asked students to describe the trend of the points inside the oval. Rebecca motioned upward in a straight line ",22,Working with Noise in Bivariate Data

Rebecca also later used this oval representation to highlight the aggregate when working with a different data set (see fi g. 4).",24,Working with Noise in Bivariate Data

26,Working with Noise in Bivariate Data,"Although students had begun to focus on the aggregate while working with spaghetti bridges, sometimes they still examined individual data points when it would have been better to consider the larger picture. Shonice, for example, disagreed with Joseph’s observation that the number of spaghetti strands and the number of pennies increased together, since three strands of spaghetti held less weight than two strands (see fi g. 3). To better focus students’ attention on the overall trend, during our next two lessons, we had them gather data from a context with a minimal amount of noise. Each student received a strand of Fruit-by-the-Foot. They took bites from the strand. After each bite, they recorded the remaining length of the strand. They plotted their data in a scatterplot, with number of bites on the horizontal axis and remaining length on the vertical axis. We hoped ",26,Working with Noise in Bivariate Data

32,Working with Noise in Bivariate Data,"During the Fruit-by-the-Foot  activity, as expected, students produced graphs with pronounced linear signals and very little noise. Figure 5, for example, shows Shonice’s data. As she produced the graph, Shonice remarked how straight it was, hence attending to an aggregate feature. When we asked her about the relationship in the graph, she said that as the number of  bites went up, the length of the strand went down. She motioned downhill left to right to indicate a negative relationship. Shonice’s comments and actions suggested that she was viewing the data as an aggregate rather than just a collection of individual points. Because our students commented on the straightness of the graphs they produced, we asked them to sketch straight lines through their data to capture the trends they saw. For example, Rebecca attempted to fi t a straight line to one particular data  set (while thinking about the similar situation of taking bites of licorice) (see fi g. 6). When we asked students what the lines meant and how they might be useful, Shonice said they could help fi nd how many bites it would take someone to fi nish eating a strand. When asked how the graphs compared to the spaghetti bridges graphs, she motioned uphill from left to right to illustrate the trend in the spaghetti-bridge graph and downhill from left to right for the Fruit-bythe-Foot. The other students used similar reasoning in contrasting the two types of data sets. Seeing a graph with a clear linear signal and contrasting positive and negative linear relationships appeared to have helped students employ aggregate reasoning and discern trends. The Fruit-by-theFoot experiment had also provided a natural context for fi tting straight lines to data.",32,Working with Noise in Bivariate Data

34,Working with Noise in Bivariate Data,"Given the apparent success of the Fruit-by-the-Foot activity, we decided to see how students would handle a data set with considerably more noise. We introduced data (see fi g. 7) that showed the scores obtained on a major test (we compared it with a medical license exam) after different amounts of time spent studying. We asked students to describe the overall trend shown in the data and to predict the score that one could expect after studying for 27 hours.",34,Working with Noise in Bivariate Data

Instead, Rebecca and Shonice reverted to connecting all the dots in trying to describe its trend (see fi g. 8). Rebecca began to doubt the positive relationship between the two variables because they did not increase uniformly. The outlier (26, 34) unduly inﬂ uenced Joseph’s estimate of the score that one could expect after studying for 27 hours. DuJuan employed point-by-point reasoning in making his estimate rather than looking at overall trend. In response to these diffi culties, we put an oval around the main cloud of points (as in fi g. 4) and suggested fi tting a line to the data. However, as we continued to ask students to make predictions for missing data values, they were not naturally inclined to use straight lines to make their predictions.",36,Working with Noise in Bivariate Data
37,Working with Noise in Bivariate Data,"The approaches we had used for  previous lessons appeared to be insuffi cient for the noisier test score data. We wanted students to perceive the straight lines fi tting to data as valuable tools for making reasonable predictions. However, just pointing out that lines can be used for this purpose had not been very effective. So, in our fi nal lesson, we decided to have students contrast reasonable and unreasonable statistical predictions. We believed that contrasting these concepts with one another could be helpful, just as contrasting an outlier with the main cloud of data had helped bring both of those concepts into sharper relief.",37,Working with Noise in Bivariate Data
38,Working with Noise in Bivariate Data,Fig. 10 Students’ most reasonable score predictions are marked in green for different numbers of hours studying.,38,Working with Noise in Bivariate Data
39,Working with Noise in Bivariate Data,"To begin our fi nal lesson, we asked students to examine the test score data again, but this time with the outlying value of (26, 34) removed. We told students that the outlier was actually a mistake made in recording the data. Hence, we were justifi ed in deleting it because it represented a data recording error rather than an actual data point. Pedagogically, we actually made the decision to remove the outlier to at least temporarily reduce the amount of noise that students had to deal with in the data. With the modifi ed data set projected on a whiteboard, we asked students to come up and take turns marking in red unreasonable test score predictions for various amounts of hours spent studying. They produced unreasonable predictions (see fi g. 9). We asked students to shade in red the entire region containing the unreasonable points.",39,Working with Noise in Bivariate Data
40,Working with Noise in Bivariate Data,"Next, we asked students to come  to the board and make several reasonable predictions for various numbers of hours spent studying. They marked these points in green on the scatterplot. All the students stayed within the middle region of the graph, not shaded in red, when making their predictions. Students predicted values near the center of the unshaded region, with the exception of DuJuan, who put his predictions closer to the top of it. With several reasonable predictions on the board, we asked students to narrow down the most reasonable predictions for different numbers of hours spent studying. Students took turns marking the most reasonable score predictions for 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 hours spent studying. Students’ predictions tended to fall near the center of the unshaded region (see the green points in fi g. 10). With the green points shown in ",40,Working with Noise in Bivariate Data

43,Working with Noise in Bivariate Data,"We used noise to our advantage in helping students perceive bivariate data as an aggregate. Specifi cally, encountering outliers helped spark discussion about how they differed from the other data points. During these discussions, we talked about how the outlier fell outside the main cloud of data. It then became natural to talk about the main cloud of data as a single entity, or an aggregate. Students began identifying this main cloud of data by enclosing it with an oval (see fi g. 4). So, drawing a contrast between the outliers and the rest of the data set helped students begin to discern trends and patterns within the aggregate.",43,Working with Noise in Bivariate Data

Rebecca came up to the board and connected the green points. Joseph noticed that she had produced a nearly straight line. We asked him to use a meterstick to sketch a straight green line to show this linear pattern. His line went through the middle of the unshaded region and was near each of the green points on the board (see fi g. 11). DuJuan called Joseph’s line a “base” to show “where the points were going.” The process of isolating a reasonable region for predictions and focusing on the center of the reasonable region helped our students identify a linear signal in the noisy test score data set.

60,Working with Noise in Bivariate Data,"Encountering outliers helped spark discussion about how they differed from the other data points.   our students cut through noise in bivariate data to detect a linear signal. As students explored this contrast in the context of test score data, a reasonable region emerged (see fi g. 10). The center of the reasonable region became a natural place for students to put an informal line of best fi t to use for making predictions about data values not included in the set (see fi g. 11).
