Target Geometry and Probability Using a Dartboard,2,mtms2011-02-375a,,
"As middle-grades students explore area problems in geometry class, they typically calculate areas of circles and squares using formulas. Sometimes they explore problems using special polygons to compare a shaded area to an unshaded area. Students are often asked to simulate probability through the use of coins and dice. However,  these situations contain little  motivation for fi nding a  solution. The following dartboard activity investigates how students can use simulations to determine experimental probability and build on intuition to make connections between calculating  area and fi nding the theoretical  probability of random events.

"Before introducing the dartboards, students should analyze the randomdigit table (see table 1). The table of numbers simulates rolling a die and generating random numbers. The table’s rows and columns of random digits are grouped in fi ves. It can be read either horizontally or vertically. Many of the students in the eighthgrade class had not encountered such a random-digit table, so we asked them what they thought it was. Students immediately began making observations about the table and we heard these remarks:  table 1 A random-digit table simulates randomly selecting digits from 0 to 9. In this table, the digits are grouped into five-digit clusters.",10,mtms2011-02-375a,,

Dartboard C •  It is a table filled with numbers. •  They are all random. •  Five numbers are grouped together. ,16,mtms2011-02-375a,,
"The purpose of the random-digit table was to generate the experimental probability of a randomly thrown dart hitting either gray or black on the dartboard. Four digits were selected at random, which represented the coordinates of the flight of the dart. For example, if row 4, column 2 was chosen (see table 1), the digits 9309 would be recorded. As a class, we discussed that we only needed four of the five numbers in a given cell to determine the location of the dart. To help students use the table,  we posed this question: “Suppose I selected these four digits, 9309, out of the random-digit table. What are the coordinates determined from these digits for the dart?” Students analyzed dartboard A (see fig. 1a) and contemplated how they could determine coordinates for the dart. Most students immediately recognized that the numbers could be split into an ordered pair (93, 09). ",17,mtms2011-02-375a,,
"When we asked them to further  scrutinize the dartboard to determine the intervals for the coordinates, they realized that since the x-axis and  y-axis ranged from 0 to 10, they needed to place a decimal point between the digits (9.3, 0.9) . We then  asked them, “What color did the dart hit?” They answered, “Gray!” For each style of dartboard, students needed to simulate “throwing” 10 darts by extracting ten groups of four digits from the table. They recorded the random digits and then determined the coordinates for the dart and the color the dart hit.  daRtBoaRd a",18,mtms2011-02-375a,,
"Before completing the simulations, we asked students to predict the probability of hitting gray and black and compare their predictions with the theoretical probability calculated using the geometric models. For dartboard A, the most common prediction was  “80 percent of the time, black was hit; and 20 percent of the time, gray was hit.” At the beginning of the activity, students should work with a partner to determine the random digits, the dart coordinates, and the color hit. One student was the recorder, and the other student “threw” the dart, which meant that they had to use the coordinates to locate where the dart hit and identify the color. Several students marked the dartboard with points to show where the dart hit. ",19,mtms2011-02-375a,,
"After completing the simulations,  students should have identified the experimental probability of hitting the gray and black areas. Students shared their solutions, which led to the realization that the two events, hitting gray versus hitting black, were complementary. Complementary events are two actions that make up the entire sample space and are mutually exclusive, which means they have no outcomes in common. ",20,mtms2011-02-375a,,
"When we discussed how the probability for each color could also be determined by counting squares, some students realized that they would only need to count one color and subtract this number from 100 (since there are 100 squares total). Several students also pointed out that dartboard A had symmetry, that only one corner of gray squares needed to be counted, and that the result could be multiplied by 4. ",21,mtms2011-02-375a,,
"In determining the theoretical  probability, students had no difficulties calculating the area of the circle and the square. They realized that finding the difference of these two areas would determine the theoretical probability of a randomly thrown dart hitting the gray area.  daRtBoaRd B",22,mtms2011-02-375a,,

"4. To use these integer pairs to get numbers in the desired range, place a decimal point between the first and second digit. For example {23, 4} would be point (2.3, 0.4).",27,mtms2011-02-375a,,
"students predicted that gray would be hit 35 percent of the time and black, 65 percent, commenting, “I think this board will have more gray than the other [dartboard A].” A few students predicted that there was more black area on dartboard B: “There’s no box that is completely gray.” Students were using new strategies that incorporated their geometrical reasoning to help them make probability predictions. However, the theoretical probabilities for A and B were exactly the same. To calculate the theoretical probabilities, students determined that the diameter of each small circle was five units and then calculated the area for each of the small black circles. ",28,mtms2011-02-375a,,
"After students finished calculating  the theoretical probability for dartboard B, they needed to give advice about using dartboard A versus B. Most students realized that the theoretical results were the same but commented about the different aesthetic styles of the boards:",29,mtms2011-02-375a,,
"Although the dartboards are the same probabilities, dartboard B is more spaced out and may be harder to hit [black]. I would choose A. It is easier to hit a bigger target. ",30,mtms2011-02-375a,,
I think you should use B because it looks like there is more gray than there really is. ,31,mtms2011-02-375a,,
"You can pick either one because they are the same. B has more circles to choose from, but A has a bigger target. ",32,mtms2011-02-375a,,

"Dartboard C, the last discussed, was made of concentric circles (see fig. 1c). When students estimated the probability for hitting each color with a randomly thrown dart, they commented on the uniqueness of the design. Typically, students predicted that both colors had equal probability. Since this was the third dartboard, students were quick to finish the simulations and count the squares. When it came to calculating the theoretical probability, students found the task challenging. They had difficulty calculating the first gray ring. It was hard for them to keep all the calculations organized, so we discussed how we could number the concentric circles starting with the inner-black circle (the bull’s-eye), which we labeled as black #1. Table 2 helped us organize our remaining calculations. ",34,mtms2011-02-375a,,
"At this point, students were able to  calculate the remaining areas and determine the theoretical probability for landing on each color.

When students were asked, “Which  method of estimating the probability, simulating the darts or counting the squares, produced better results?” their thinking was divided. Some students believed that using simulations was better: “Simulating the darts produced better results because it was random and throwing darts is random.” Other students reiterated this same idea by explaining that simulations were more like “actually playing on the board.” Another student preferred counting the squares: “It is easier and you can go back and double check.” This student compared the two results with the theoretical probability and used this reasoning to explain which method was better: ",41,mtms2011-02-375a,,
"Counting the squares was the most accurate for me because when we were doing the simulating darts, we had some off results, like so-so, which were way off the actual ones [theoretical]. We were also a lot closer when counting the squares versus simulating. ",42,mtms2011-02-375a,,
"The last question in the activity asked, “If a dart club chose C for its spring tournament, what mathematical thinking did they use?” Most students commented that the dart club wanted to have “a more even chance of hitting black or gray,” meaning that the probabilities of each outcome were close to 50 percent. Using similar reasoning, some students believed that dartboard C was “fair.” One student commented that the dart club used probability to make its decision: ",43,mtms2011-02-375a,,
"Based on my results, there’s a 50 percent chance you’ll hit grey, and a 50 percent chance you’ll hit black, so it’s not based on ability, it’s based on probability.  conclUsion",44,mtms2011-02-375a,,

In addition, they understood that calculating the areas allowed them to fi nd the theoretical probability, which is important in understanding the “fairness” of the game.

Students’ answers will vary based on preference and accuracy of counting boxes.  9. Based on these data, I assume that the dart club was looking for a board that had similar probabilities for hitting black and gray. (Or maybe club members really liked the concentric-circle look of a dartboard!)",113,mtms2011-02-375a,,
