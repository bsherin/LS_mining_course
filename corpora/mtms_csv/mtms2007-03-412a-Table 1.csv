The  report  is  meant  for  mathematics  educators  at  all  levels,  administrators,  state  and  federal  officials  involved in  mathematics  education,  and  interested parents. The strength of the writing is that it is an excellent work concerning the typical  chronological  coursework.

"The content of this report is a K–12 gradeby-grade  study  to  compare  and  analyze common  state  mathematics  curriculum standards, noting those that most or none  tors can design curriculum and instruction for the mathematics classroom. At its core, it relies heavily upon AAAS (American Association for the Advancement of Science) project  work  along  with  NCTM’s  Principles and Standards for School Mathematics. It provides a framework where educators are  encouraged  to  “help  themselves”  by engaging in a cycle of “inquiry, study, and reflection” to inform their decision making where “practice” decisions are concerned.

"Modifying  one’s  instructional  practice  to reflect the NCTM’s Standards is challenging.  It  is  particularly  true  when  creating ways for students to “see” mathematics in more than the rote symbolic manner that dominated the classrooms in which most teachers (myself included) learned mathematics  as  children.  Mendieta’s  Pictorial Mathematics  represents  the  experience of more than fifteen years as a mathematics  teacher  in  the  diverse  classrooms  of Los Angeles and the insights gained from studying  and  enacting  a  concept-focused approach to mathematics learning. It also contains  a  wealth  of  high-quality,  classroom-tested  ideas  that  teachers  can  explore  on  their  own  and  easily  implement in their classrooms. In the author’s words, “This book is grounded on the research of the role that multiple representations plays in  the  development  of  conceptual  understanding” (p. 21). ",49,mtms2007-03-412a,,
The importance of multiple representations in mathematics learning is evident by the prominence of Representation as one of the Process Standards in Principles and Standards for School Mathematics (NCTM 2000).  Using  multiple  representations  to help  students  gain  access  to  important concepts and relationships is critical to improving  students’  understanding  of  mathematics.  This  book  provides  tremendous help  in  supporting  students  in  working toward this goal.,50,mtms2007-03-412a,,
"Pictorial  Mathematics  is  not  simply  a compendium of visual representations that one decides how and when to insert into the  curriculum.  Rather,  it  is  written  by  a teacher, for use by other teachers, with an appreciation  that  important  in  students’ developing  conceptual  understanding  is their ability to “transform” and “translate” within and between representations. Thus, Mendieta  provides  exercises  that  require students to generate equivalent representations  within  the  same  model  (transformations) as well as those requiring translations from one form of representation to another. This feature makes the book exceptional in terms of its pedagogical value and  potential  to  positively  impact  student learning.",51,mtms2007-03-412a,,
"The  book’s  accompanying  “teacher notes”  make  transparent  what  are  often subtle yet pedagogically powerful modifications  to  the  way  in  which  students  are asked  to  engage  in  thinking  about,  and reasoning with, the representations. What is more, the resources inside the book go beyond  visual  representations  to  include games and investigations that support the development  of  conceptual  understanding.  The  material  appears  as  blackline masters,  making  it  easy  for  teachers  to adapt it for use on an overhead projector or in printed form.",52,mtms2007-03-412a,,
"I  strongly  recommend  this  book  for teachers who want to expand their ability to  support  students’  development  of  conceptual  understanding  through  the  use of  visual  representations.  Although  the resources offered are drawn from several content strands—Number and Operations (including  whole  numbers,  integers,  and rational  numbers),  Algebra,  Geometry, and  Probability  and  Statistics—the  book has  just  over  one-half  its  pages  devoted to decimals, fractions, ratios, and algebra. This makes sense, given that students often find these topics challenging to understand. Although useful to teachers from K– 12,  Pictorial  Mathematics  is  invaluable  to those who teach mathematics from grade 4 through algebra.—Mark Ellis, California State University—Fullerton, Fullerton, CA 92834-6868.",53,mtms2007-03-412a,,
