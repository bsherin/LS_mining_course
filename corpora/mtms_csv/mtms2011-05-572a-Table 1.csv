This book is intended for secondary mathematics teachers wanting to integrate differentiation into their teaching. The authors begin by introducing two approaches to differentiation that are the foundation of the book: open questions and parallel tasks. The remainder of the book demonstrates how these two approaches can be applied across the five NCTM Content Standards.,6,mtms2011-05-572a,,

"Lin’s attempt to make differentiation manageable. The open questions are designed to afford access to all learners. Parallel tasks are developed so that they can be discussed together during whole-class discussions. Two typical differentiated instruction issues (the time required to develop and debrief tasks) are considered and addressed. Insights into designing open questions and parallel tasks are provided throughout the text, along with a framework for developing your own.",10,mtms2011-05-572a,,
I have already recommended this book to several teachers with whom I work who want to learn more about a reasonable approach to using differentiated instruction in their math classrooms.,11,mtms2011-05-572a,,

"This book provides a glimpse into how proof is used in each of the five NCTM Content Standards of Number  and Operations, Algebra, Geometry, Data Analysis and Probability, and Measurement. Activities within each chapter allow students to move from exploration to conjecture to reasoning and explanation of mathematical statements within each of the Content Standards. ",15,mtms2011-05-572a,,
"Although the ideas presented in  the text focus on helping high school students further their understanding of reasoning and proof, the activities could easily be used with elementary and secondary preservice teachers. For instance, the “Probing Products” activity in chapter 1 allows students to explore patterns and relationships among the figurate numbers, such as triangular and square numbers, which are often introduced in mathematics courses for preservice elementary teachers. By representing figurate numbers using arrays of dots, students can visualize and understand that a square number is composed of two consecutive triangular numbers. This in turn leads to writing an algebraic expression for the nth triangular number. The algebraic expression can be used to develop the relationship between oblong numbers and triangular numbers. This leads to understanding relationships between factors and products.",16,mtms2011-05-572a,,
"Some activities in the text allow  students to reason and make conjectures using technology, such as a graphing calculator or a dynamic geometry software program. In “A Hex on Pythagoras” in chapter 3, students use Cabri® Geometry or The Geometer’s Sketchpad® to generate a Pythagorean hexagon and explore the relationships found among the four triangles formed in the given figure. ",17,mtms2011-05-572a,,
"Simulations on the graphing  calculator allow students to explore phenomena in probability and then use statistical reasoning to confirm or disprove their results. The “Derek Jeter Steps into the Box” activity in chapter 4 is an expected-value problem. The activity uses simulation, statistics, and averaging to determine the expected number of boxes that one would need to buy before obtaining a Derek Jeter baseball card. These activities as well as many others provide a good introduction to the proof process and help students understand why proof is important in mathematics.",18,mtms2011-05-572a,,
The solutions to the activities in  each chapter and blackline masters are provided in both the appendix and on the CD.

"Over the course of four years, eight secondary mathematics teachers  participated in a professional development program to enhance discourse in their classrooms. This book is an outgrowth of the project, describing how these teachers transformed instructional practices.",22,mtms2011-05-572a,,
"Two introductory chapters describe  each element of the project and how teachers became action researchers. The sections that follow present a chapter describing the process of change. The teachers discuss how analyzing their beliefs and studying artifacts such as articles and book chapters, as well as videos and transcripts of their own teaching, influenced them to take their students to deeper levels of discourse. The book concludes with two chapters that summarize the results.",23,mtms2011-05-572a,,
"Readers will find the beginning and ending chapters to be rich in research and teaching philosophy; the middle chapters contain practical information. Specific problems used with students, as well as classroom dialogues, are cited throughout the book. Insights shared by these teachers can motivate a reader, with plenty of practical examples to try in the classroom. The teacher-authors address topics ranging from using technology to allowing student ownership of their learning to effectively listening to students.",24,mtms2011-05-572a,,

"Adventures with Mathematics is a collection of activities for students to complete over the summer to solidify their learning of algebra 1. The book includes a clear layout of the connections to Michigan’s algebra 1 content expectations and addresses most of the expectations with one or more activities, including games, puzzles, and such activities as finding patterns in quilt designs. Although the book’s subtitle is Climbing from Algebra 1 to Geometry, the emphasis is on algebra 1, making it potentially valuable in the summer before algebra 2.",29,mtms2011-05-572a,,
"In looking closely at some of the  activities, I identified several potential concerns. First, the book contains mathematical errors, such as a typo replacing a plus sign with an equals sign. In another case, the geometric design of the quilts does not appear to follow a pattern or match the solutions shown in the back of the book, which do follow a clear pattern. Second, only selected answers and minimal conceptual explanations are included; more information is needed to deepen students’ understanding, especially absent a teacher. Third, some problems are unclearly stated. Fourth, the material seems relatively advanced. Considering these concerns, imagining students doing this work on their own without some form of teacher support is difficult, unless they are already high-achieving math students. Overall, this resource has promise, but teachers and parents  interested in using it should carefully examine it.",30,mtms2011-05-572a,,

Math Problem-Solving Skills:  Developing Successful Strategies is one book in a series created for grades 1 through 6. The book created for grades 5−6 presents mathematical investigations to improve students’ problemsolving skills and strategies. ,38,mtms2011-05-572a,,
"The investigations guide students through the problem-solving process of analyzing the problem, exploring a means to a solution, and trying a solution strategy. The investigations were developed to meet the NCTM Standards appropriate to the fifth and sixth grades, with a focus on the Standards of Problem Solving and Data Analysis and Probability. Each set of investigations includes a teacher’s notes page with problem-solving objectives, solution strategies, information about areas where students might have difficulties, and extension questions.

My students were more interested in the process and strategy of solving the problems than the actual problem topics. ",40,mtms2011-05-572a,,
"The investigations involve students solving a series of problems that focus on a Standard and mathematical concept, such as number operations  of multiplication and division and mathematical reasoning. The problems build on previous problem-solving strategies and then increase in difficulty. The investigations progress in complexity, allowing teachers to differentiate instruction for all students. More advanced students will be challenged while developing problem solvers will be able to build on what they know. Overall, although the problems are identified by mathematical concepts and standards, they guide students’ thinking to focus on the development of problem-solving strategies, skills, and thinking. ",41,mtms2011-05-572a,,
"The teacher’s notes pages that  accompany each investigation feature helpful discussions and insights. The identification of “problem difficulties” gives teachers some trouble areas to observe while working with their students. This helps teachers be on the lookout for, and understand why, students are not being successful. It also explores ideas about how to change the learning experience. ",42,mtms2011-05-572a,,
"The physical format of the problems was a small obstacle for classroom use. As a classroom teacher, I retyped the word problems so that only one or two problems were presented to students and also provided a “thinking” place for students to create charts and diagrams.
