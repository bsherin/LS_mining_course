3,Patterns on a Calendar - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1),The Patterns on a Calendar problem asked students to critique conjectures made by other students to determine if the conjectures held in all cases or in only some specific cases. The students were also asked to create and justify their own patterns on the calendar.,,
4,Patterns on a Calendar - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1),"Making and analyzing conjectures is a vital skill for mathematicians (as well as being a useful problem-solving tool in many areas of life). This type of thinking also underlies the notion of proofproviding a logical explanation why a certain finding always holds when the given initial conditions are met. Middle-grades students solving this problem would also use the Standards for Mathematical Practice 3 (Construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others), 7 (Look for and make use of structure), and 8 (Look for and express regularity in repeated reasoning).",,
5,Patterns on a Calendar - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1),"For this problem, we received work from eight students in sixth grade and seventh grade, which was submitted by two teachers, Rebecca Layton and Jeff Chaffee.",,
6,Patterns on a Calendar - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1),"Elaine, a seventh-grade student in Chaffees class, used an algebraic approach to check the validity of the students conjectures given in the Patterns on a Calendar problem. For example, when checking Jessies conjecture that the sum of the four dates in an L shape was eight times as large as the smallest date in the shape, Elaine chose the variable x to represent the smallest date in the L shape and then represented the other three dates within the L shape based on how much greater they were than x (see fig. 1).",,
7,Patterns on a Calendar - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1),,,
8,Patterns on a Calendar - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1),"She then set up and solved an equation based on Jessies conjecture. After solving, Elaine noticed that the only value for x that made the equation true was x = 6; hence, Jessies conjecture did not hold true in all cases. In fact, it only held true when the smallest date in the L shape was 6. A middle-grades student could also make a convincing argument that Jessies conjecture will not always work by providing a specific counterexample to the conjecture. For example, a student could choose another L shape (say, one starting on the 7) and show that 7 + 14 + 15 + 16 = 52 but that eight times the smallest date was actually 56 (8  7).",,
9,Patterns on a Calendar - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1),"Similarly, Elaine was able to prove that a conjecture was always true by using algebra (see fig. 2).",,
10,Patterns on a Calendar - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1),,,
11,Patterns on a Calendar - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1),"When analyzing Devrahs conjecture that the sum of three dates in a diagonal was a multiple of three, Elaine again represented the smallest date within the diagonal with the variable x and then represented the other two dates within the diagonal based on how much greater they were than x. She then set up an expression and simplified it to show that the sum of the three dates in any diagonal, moving from left to right on the calendar (and fitting completely on the calendar), will be a multiple of 3, since the simplified algebraic expression is divisible by 3. It is interesting to note that in her explanation, Elaine used inverse functions (multiplying a number by 3, then dividing it by 3 produced the original number, no matter what the original number). It is also worth noting that Devrahs conjecture works if the diagonal moved from right to left as well. Elaines approach could be adapted to justify this.",,
12,Patterns on a Calendar - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1),"Many patterns on a calendar can also be analyzed by using principles of odd and even numbers. For example, Natalie, a sixth-grade student in Laytons class, created her own calendar pattern. Her pattern took the form of a plus sign, and whether the sum of the dates within the plus sign was odd or even was based on whether the date in the middle of the plus sign was odd or even (see fig. 3 for this pattern and another pattern created by Natalie).",,
13,Patterns on a Calendar - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1),,,
14,Patterns on a Calendar - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1),"She did not justify that her pattern could work for any plus sign that fit completely on the calendar. However, using properties of odd and even numbers made this an appropriate pattern for middle-grades students to justify. For example, a student could note that the two dates on either side (horizontally) from the center date will either both be odd or both be even. In either case, the sum of those two dates would be even. Similarly, the two dates directly above or below the center date would either both be odd or both be even (since they are 14 apart from each other, and an odd number plus 14 is odd and an even number plus 14 is even). In either case, the sum of those two numbers would be even as well. Hence, the sum of the four dates surrounding the center date would be even, and so the parityoddness or evennessof the center date dictated the parity of the sum of all five dates. A student could also justify Natalies conjecture using algebra. Please note that Natalies pattern is shown on the October 2015 calendar rather than the July 2015 calendar given in the Patterns on a Calendar problem. Natalies pattern would work on any calendar, however.",,
15,Patterns on a Calendar - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1),"Will, a sixth-grade student in Laytons class, also created his own patterns on the October 2015 calendar. One pattern he chose to create was an L shape that was similar to that used by Jessie in the Patterns on a Calendar problem. He noted that the sum of the two smallest dates was always 10 less than the sum of the two larger dates within the L pattern (see fig. 4).",,
16,Patterns on a Calendar - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1),,,
17,Patterns on a Calendar - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1),"Will provided a specific example for his pattern, but did not justify that the pattern should work for any L shape of the same configuration that fit on the calendar. Moving from examples using specific numbers to justification that the pattern will work using any starting number provided a middle-grades-appropriate application of algebraic thinking. A student could justify Wills pattern by representing the smallest date in the L shape by a variable (in this case, d) and showing that the sum of the two smallest dates,",,
18,Patterns on a Calendar - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1),"d + (d + 7),",,
19,Patterns on a Calendar - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1),"will simplify to 2d + 7 , whereas the sum of the two largest dates,",,
20,Patterns on a Calendar - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1),"(d + 8) + (d + 9),",,
21,Patterns on a Calendar - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1),"will simplify to 2d + 17. Subtracting the two simplified expressions yields a difference of 10, thus showing that Wills conjecture was true in general rather than just in the specific example he showed. Middle-grades students who are not yet comfortable with algebraic expressions could still justify Wills conjecture by realizing that the second smallest date in the L shape must be 7 larger than the smallest date and that the next two dates are 8 and 9 larger, respectively, than the smallest date. They could then compare 8 + 9 = 17 and 7 to see the difference of 10 in the sums of the dates.",,
22,Patterns on a Calendar - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1),Below is a summary of other patterns that Laytons students found on the October 2015 calendar. These patterns were provided without justification. We urge teachers to consider using these patterns with their students to give the students experience critiquing the reasoning of others.,,
23,Patterns on a Calendar - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1),Will: The product of two adjacent dates (vertically or horizontally) on the calendar is even.,,
24,Patterns on a Calendar - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1),Addy and Emma: The sum of two adjacent dates (vertically or horizontally) on the calendar is odd.,,
25,Patterns on a Calendar - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1),Emma: The sum of two diagonal dates on the calendar is even.,,
26,Patterns on a Calendar - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1),"Katie, Ethan, and Natalie: The sum of four dates in a row (vertically or horizontally or diagonally) is even.",,
27,Patterns on a Calendar - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1),Anna: The sum of three adjacent dates (horizontally or vertically or diagonally) is a multiple of three.,,
28,Patterns on a Calendar - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1),"In summary, making and justifying conjectures occurs naturally when looking for patterns on a calendar. An activity such as this allows middle-grades students to be creative and think critically as they work to find and justify their own patterns and critique the patterns found by others. It also allows for a concrete application of the algebra skills learned in the middle grades as well as emphasizing concepts related to odd and even numbers.",,
29,Patterns on a Calendar - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1),"This type of activity also foreshadows work with proof that students will do in later grades. In particular, to show that a conjecture is always true, it is necessary to provide a convincing argument that works for any numbers, rather than depend on specific numeric values. On the other hand, to show that a conjecture is not always true, it is sufficient to provide a specific counterexample (a specific example that meets the constraints in the conjecture but does not fit the pattern stated in the conjecture).",,
