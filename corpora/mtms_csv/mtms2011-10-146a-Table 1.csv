"Nesrin Cengiz and Margaret Rathouz “Division of fractions is often considered the most mechanical and least understood topic in elementary school” (Tirosh 2000, p. 6). Enacting fraction division tasks in meaningful ways requires that teachers know not only how fraction division works but also why it works (e.g., Cramer et al. 2010). We have created materials to help preservice teachers develop that knowledge. To provide sufficient time for the learners to engage and struggle with cognitively demanding tasks (Stein et al. 2009), just one or two complex problems are explored during one-hundred-minute periods. Various  multiple solution methods and representations and to press for justifications of solutions, modeling the type of instruction these teachers could use with their future students (Grant, Lo, and Flowers 2007; Rathouz 2009).",2,mtms2011-10-146a,,
"A sequence of tasks will be presented that is designed to promote an understanding of fraction division, and brief vignettes will explore their implementation. In particular, following a discussion of prerequisite experiences in whole-number division, two types of fraction division activities will be addressed: those helping  build the concept of the unit and those helping connect representations (see fig. 1). Although these tasks were implemented with preservice teachers, examining these tasks may help in-service teachers deepen their own understanding of fraction division. Further, the activities provide seeds for mathematical tasks that teachers might enact with middle school learners. We suggest that the reader work on each task as it arises in the article. Then, read about our experience implementing each activity, and reflect on how it might be modified for use with middle school students.",3,mtms2011-10-146a,,

"In initial tasks of the fractions unit, preservice teachers begin to recognize the roles of the numerator and the denominator and to appreciate the need to identify, label, and track units while solving fraction problems. During an in-class discussion of the task shown in figure 2, preservice teachers solidify these important ideas as they share their problem-solving processes and reasoning. The different approaches described below by Kelly and Jason  fig. 1 Two story problems represented by the same division expression can elicit rich discussion.",5,mtms2011-10-146a,,
"Consider the following two stories for 12 ÷ 3 = ?  1. sally has 12 marbles, and she wants to give 3 to each friend. To how many friends can she give her marbles? 2. sally has 12 marbles, and she  wants to distribute them among three friends. how many marbles will she give to each friend?",6,mtms2011-10-146a,,
"Note that in the first problem (measurement division), the size of the group (3 marbles per friend) is known and the number of groups (4 friends) is unknown. in the second problem (partitive division), the number of groups  (3 friends) to be formed is known and the size of the group (4 marbles per friend) is unknown. although middle school students do not necessarily need to name these division situations, teachers should fully understand the two processes to ensure that students are exposed to both interpretations. Further, using each interpretation of division in fraction situations is critical for helping students make connections between the context and the method of calculation.",7,mtms2011-10-146a,,

"This problem and the descriptions  illustrate the various units that need to be tracked in this division problem (6 ÷ 2/5), including “the cookie,” “the batch,” “the group of 3 cookies,” and “the 1/5 batch.” Although connections to fraction division are not made at this stage, eliciting multiple solutions and pressing for reasoning help learners make sense of the part-whole interpretation of a fraction and the role of the numerator (the number of groups shown) and denominator (the number of equal groups in the whole batch).  connecting rePresentations",10,mtms2011-10-146a,,

From Stories to Diagrams  and Symbols,12,mtms2011-10-146a,,
"The task shown in figure 3 requires identifying multiplication and division in story contexts and associating those contexts with numeric expressions. The first story is a measurement  division problem; the size of the “groups” is known, and the number of groups is needed. The emergence of several possible ways to name the remainder creates an opening to discuss the critical issue of the unit and how it shifts from “cups of flour” to “batches of cookies.” An initial (erroneously  labeled) diagram produced by preservice teachers to solve question 1 appears in figure 4. Their explanations follow: ",13,mtms2011-10-146a,,

"Megan: We don’t need a whole cup. If we only need a half to make a full batch, then don’t we only need to count to the next half, so you would have 2/3 of 1/2, which gives you 2/3 of a batch?

"Danielle: The 2/6 is measuring how much of a cup is leftover, and we want to know how much of a batch is leftover. Since we only have enough to make 2/3 of another batch, the answer should be 1 2/3 batches. ",27,mtms2011-10-146a,,
"Analyzing work in progress  provides an opportunity to interpret, revise, and complete solutions collaboratively. Encouraging learners to refl ect on the shared diagram, while referring to the problem context and naming units for all numbers, allows them to convince one another that 1 2/3 batches makes more sense. As they continue to work on problems in fi gure 3, issues arise concerning fraction multiplication and division. In the second story problem, 5/6 batch is shared between 2 people (the number of groups is 2 and the size of each group is needed). Some recognize that it is partitive division and that  the expression 5/6 ÷ 2 goes with the problem. Others view the problem as fi nding 1/2 of 5/6 and choose or or or as corresponding expressions. They realize that the commutative property holds for multiplication. Discussing this story and these two expressions reinforces the idea that multiplying by a unit fraction (1/2) is equivalent to dividing by its whole-number reciprocal (2). This sets the groundwork for thinking about division by any fraction as multiplication by its reciprocal, as occurs in the standard invert-andmultiply algorithm. ",28,mtms2011-10-146a,,

The calculation given was ÷ , and students were required to provide two unique stories and diagrams using different interpretations of division. We ask preservice teachers to create stories and diagrams to illustrate their understandings of the two meanings of fraction division (partitive and measurement), so that they will be able to use both interpretations fl exibly when working with their students. ",29,mtms2011-10-146a,,
"We intentionally ask our preservice teachers to begin work independently for two reasons: (1) to allow them time to think; and (2) to promote diversity in stories and solutions, which will be shared with their small group and the class. One group’s story and initial diagram are shown in fi gure 5a. The rest of the class is asked to refl ect on what type of division (partitive or measurement) is represented by the story and how the diagram could be used to solve the problem.

"It is not uncommon for “Why  is this division?” and “What should we call the remainder?” to arise multiple times during this unit. These questions occurred with the group of students who are highlighted in  stories and diagrams  in the following dialogue, the teacher and students are discussing stories and diagrams that they used to represent 2 1/2 ÷ 3/4.

Teacher: i asked this group to show its work in progress. Can you tell from the  story and the diagram how they were thinking about division?,32,mtms2011-10-146a,,
"Melissa: aren’t they saying that 3/4 is the serving size, so they’re dividing each gallon into fourths? so then she can count 1, 2, 3 [fourths]; that’s one serving. There’s one leftover fourth to start the next serving. Then keep counting out servings as 3/4 of a gallon.",33,mtms2011-10-146a,,
David: But why is that division?,34,mtms2011-10-146a,,
Teacher: i think several people are wondering that. so i’d like you to go back  to your small groups and discuss why this might be a division problem. [preservice teachers have a brief small-group discussion and return to the whole group.],35,mtms2011-10-146a,,
Melissa: i think it’s like asking how many 3/4 gallon servings are in 2 1/2  gallons. isn’t that measurement division?,36,mtms2011-10-146a,,
"David: Ok, i can see that . . . like with whole-number division, 12 divided by  3 means how many 3s are in 12.",37,mtms2011-10-146a,,
Teacher: More of you seem convinced that this is a division problem. Now  how are we going to use that diagram to solve the problem?,38,mtms2011-10-146a,,
Taylor: she already separated them into fourths. i would just circle groups of 3  [see ﬁ g. 5b] like this. so three servings is what i see. But there’s 1/4 leftover. ,39,mtms2011-10-146a,,
Nicole: isn’t that last fourth really 1/3 of a serving?,40,mtms2011-10-146a,,
Teacher: Maybe we should label the diagram so we know what’s what. There  seems to be an issue around this leftover amount. What is this extra amount of juice?,41,mtms2011-10-146a,,
"Melissa: at fi rst i was thinking that it should be 3 1/4 because there was  enough juice for 3 whole servings and then there was an extra 1/4 [gallon] leftover, but now i can see it’s 1/3 of a serving, because you only need 3 pieces for a full serving.",42,mtms2011-10-146a,,
"fig. 5 Given an expression including division of fractions, one group devised the following story and illustrated it with initial diagram (a); diagram (b) illustrates the solution.",43,mtms2011-10-146a,,
"The principal has 2 1/2 gallons of juice for the preschool classes. a 3/4 gallon serving will go to each teacher. how many servings are in the 2 1/2 gallons? (a) (b)  the sidebar above. Sending preservice teachers back to their small groups to consider why this might be a division problem encourages them to build on prior knowledge. Melissa’s rephrasing of the question as “How many 3/4 gallon servings are in 2 1/2 gallons?” helps remind David of measurement division in a whole-number context. Asking them to reason about the solution, including the initial erroneous remainder, causes them to revisit and revise their earlier thinking. The group eventually reaches a consensus on how to interpret the remainder by referring to the appropriate referent unit of the quotient (1/3 serving rather than 1/4 gallon).",44,mtms2011-10-146a,,
"Although it is premature to summarize for our learners the connections between actions on their diagrams and the steps in the invert-and-multiply algorithm, we provide an aside for the reader to make those connections explicit. The original 2 1/2 gallons is equivalent to 10 quarter gallons, the 10 arising from 2 1/2 × 4. Then the 10 quarter gallons are measured out by 3s, refl ecting division by 3 (see fi g. 5b).

The instructor next requests a story  that uses a partitive interpretation of the same expression: 111,46,mtms2011-10-146a,,
"Writing these stories is highly challenging work. Many partitive stories written during the whole-number unit had involved sharing some number of items among a certain number of people. With a problem such as ÷ , most learners are unsure how to handle 2 1/2 items “shared” among 3/4 of a person. But because interpreting operations in several different ways is highlighted throughout the course, one group’s effort to write a different story is tentatively presented to the rest of the class.",47,mtms2011-10-146a,,
"Students were then asked to  consider the question in fi gure 6. The instructor does not attempt to sort out which interpretation of division it is but waits until learners have a chance to grapple with solving the problem. (See the sidebar,  “Student Discussion of Figure 6’s Driving Question,” for the verbatim dialogue.) Rana’s explanation helps the group recognize that since 2 1/2 miles represent 3/4 of the way, it makes sense to divide 2 1/2 miles by 3 to fi nd 1/4 of the way.",48,mtms2011-10-146a,,
