"JI-eUN  Lee,  lee2345@oakland.edu,  is  an  assistant  professor at Oakland University, Rochester, MI 48309. She teaches K–8 mathematics methods courses and is interested in developing instructional strategies for conceptual understanding. KyOUNG- Tae KIm, kimlee365@yahoo.com, is a research scientist. He is interested in the integration of mathematics and science.  if Soodong is a total stranger, is it possible to answer them  correctly?  This  article  explores  an  instructional idea wherein students figure out the correct answers  using  the  power  of  mathematics,  particularly the power of algebraic thinking—even though students do not know Soodong. The context of the problems in this article involves an individual’s personal information, which other people do not know, and ends with generalized patterns of solutions. Koirala and Goodwin (2000) introduced a simple form of a similar activity called mathmagic. In one example, students were asked to solve a simple magic problem: “Think of any number, add 7, add 3, and subtract your original number.” all students computed the same answer, 10. This context works for everyone because the final answer is independent of the original number that the student chose. In algebraic form, it can be solved as x + 7 + 3 – x = 10.

"In this article, we propose several advanced contexts that incorporate simple linear equations and simultaneous equations. all the problem contexts are related to the student’s personal life. This condition draws students’ attention to important characteristics of algebraic thinking. The ultimate goal of this activity is to facilitate the smooth transition from arithmetic to algebra by focusing on students’ understanding of variables, not only when the solution has a specific value but also when it has a range of values.

"The receNT emphaSIS ON aLGebraIc ThINKING in school mathematics supports algebra as a strand that is begun in the early grades (NcTm 2000). We hope this early exposure will help students become comfortable  with  algebraic  symbols  at  the  middle school and high school levels. This use of symbols is one of the obstacles that students encounter with algebra (e.g., philipp 1992; Usiskin 1988). algebraic symbols,  in  particular  letters,  are  used  in  several ways: as specific unknowns (e.g., 3 + n = 10); in formulas (e.g., Area = l × w [length × width]); and to represent a range of values, as in the expression of generalized patterns (e.g., y = 3t + 6) (Kuchemann 1981; NcTm 2000; Usiskin 2000). however, Kieran (1991) pointed out that “the use of letters to represent a range of values is far more neglected in the teaching of prealgebra than their use of unknowns” (p. 49). In addition, some research studies show that many students have difficulties seeing the link between arithmetic and algebra, also known as generalized arithmetic (Lee and Wheeler 1989; peck and Jencks 1988). NcTm (2000) suggests that students’ facility with symbol manipulation can be enhanced when it is based on extensive experience with quantities in contexts. In response to this suggestion, the  problems presented in this article provide students with  contexts  that  clearly  show  the  link  between arithmetic and algebra, with particular attention paid to the variable as representing a range of values.

"Using Personalized Contexts a  GOOd  prObLem-pOSING  STraTeGy  haS  a  profound positive effect not only on understanding mathematical concepts but also on creating a more investigative  classroom  climate  (Whitin  2004).  according  to  previous  research,  personalizing  mathematics word-problem contexts is a good problemposing  strategy.  This  strategy  draws  and  focuses students’ attention on the problem context and helps motivate them to solve it. at the same time, students’ attitudes are more positive when their interests are incorporated into the question asked (mayer 1984). We designed the problems so that students could benefit  from  these  personalized  contexts  to  help them understand variables as representing a range of values. In the activity, an eighth grader and a sixth grader were paired as a “private eye” and a “client.” We  gave  prescribed  directions  to  the  private  eye. The private eye asked a series of questions, which required arithmetic computations by the client. at the final stage, the private eye revealed the client’s personal information using the generalized patterns, that is, algebra. The following section presents examples that use a personalized context for creating generalized solution patterns. ",11,mtms2007-03-406a,,

"The  STUdeNTS’  dIScUSSION  aFTer  WOrKING through  the  examples  described  above  showed their interest in doing each activity, reasoning how it works, and creating their own versions of games. Joel was more interested in type b problems. In example 7, he made some conjectures on the shaded directions, listing the possible pairs of numbers in each case. Lyta and Joel had an extensive discussion on this approach. Table 8 shows the summary of their discussion. It was not the procedure we originally  intended,  but  it  worked.  Joel  also  mentioned, “I think I can make another problem  like  this.”  Lyta  was familiar  with  algebraic  equations, which helped her successfully  perform  the  role of  private  eye.  She  commented,  “I  have  a  better understanding of simultaneous equations after this game.”  This  comment  implies  that  Lyta  rediscovered  the  meaning  of  her  mathematical actions through  this activity.",37,mtms2007-03-406a,,

The students’ work supports the point that students’ real-life  information  raises  the  level  of  interest  and engagement in the transition from arithmetic to algebra. We supplied the prescribed directions and asked students to reason about the generalized patterns behind our rules. however, as readers may notice, many variations are possible for each example. This activity could be extended by asking students to develop their own directions. as educators, we should allow and encourage students like Joel to make various conjectures and explore other possibilities. We hope that students will see and experience the power of generalizations as an important tool for mathematical problem solvers while they are working through this activity. ",47,mtms2007-03-406a,,
