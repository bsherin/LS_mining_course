LEBRON’S BODY MASS INDEX IS WHAT? 1. How would you respond to the ,3,mtms2011-04-456a,,
"Born Loser’s wife? Why?  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), body mass index (BMI) is computed using pounds and inches as follows: ",4,mtms2011-04-456a,,
"Divide a person’s weight in pounds by his or her height in inches squared, then multiply by a conversion factor of 703.  2. According to the ofﬁ cial NBA Web  site, NBA.com, LeBron James is 6 ft., 8 in. tall and weighs 250 lbs. Compute his BMI.  3. The following table shows the CDC’s interpretation of BMI for adults. According to this index, what is James’s weight status? Explain why his weight status does or does not seem reasonable.",5,mtms2011-04-456a,,

FIELD-TEST COMMENTS,31,mtms2011-04-456a,,
"Because of the mathematical strategies involved, I had my ﬁ fth-grade mathematics students work together in pairs to complete this assignment. They were very interested in the topic, and the assignment spurred many lively discussions among them. ",32,mtms2011-04-456a,,
"They verbally described their  problem-solving strategies with their partners as they worked, trying to decide which would be most efﬁ cient and which would produce correct responses. ",33,mtms2011-04-456a,,
"Two of my male students already knew that muscle tissue weighs more than fat tissue; after they voiced that fact, students were able to have valid discussions about the professional athletes who were listed in the activity. ",34,mtms2011-04-456a,,
"The athletes listed in question 4 and the challenge in question 5 were not enough to satisfy my students. Many of them wanted to survey other people at our school, including some male ﬁ fth-grade teachers, to calculate their BMI numbers, as well. Almost all wanted to calculate their own BMI before ﬁ nishing the assignment.  —Tina Gay, K. E. Taylor Elementary School, Lawrenceville, Georgia",35,mtms2011-04-456a,,
"OTHER IDEAS •  Choose athletes from local teams instead of professionals. •  For people under twenty years old, the BMI uses age, weight, and height  numbers, since young people’s bodies are still developing. The Web site http://apps.nccd.cdc.gov/dnpabmi/ has a link that describes how to accurately measure height and weight. Students can determine their BMI using the site calculator, ﬁ nd the range of normal for a person who is his or her age and height by increasing and/or decreasing the weight without changing the height or age, and recalculate the theoretical BMI. Students can graph the weight versus the BMI and discuss the shape of the graph.",36,mtms2011-04-456a,,
•  This exercise could be incorporated into a ﬁ tness project over time. ,37,mtms2011-04-456a,,
Students could keep track of their BMI and create a line graph to analyze changes over time.,38,mtms2011-04-456a,,
"•  Have students create a survey to use with (1) family members or (2) a subgroup at their school (students in their homeroom classes, teachers, members of a club, and so on). Ask students to calculate the group members’ BMIs.",39,mtms2011-04-456a,,
