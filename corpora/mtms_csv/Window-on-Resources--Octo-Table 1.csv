If the questions in the investigations were printable documents, students could work in small groups. This way, students would be more involved in the activity. ",9,Window on Resources  October 2013
10,Window on Resources  October 2013,"Most activities go from the teacher doing everything to the “I do it” component. Having a “we do it” component would allow a gradual release of responsibility. When stating estimated times, use of minutes rather than class periods would also help. Class periods differ in length in schools across the country. My last thought is that activities involving competition are not good for middle-level students.",10,Window on Resources  October 2013

For example, in “The Look of the Lesson: Students” chapter, Moynihan discusses the importance of active listening. She shares the definition of active listening, discusses why it is important, and when students should be engaged in active listening. In addition, for each recommendation, she includes what she calls a “magnification,” in which she shares a real-life implementation to help the reader better understand the strategy being discussed.",25,Window on Resources  October 2013

32,Window on Resources  October 2013,"In this brief review, I cannot  discuss all 60+ tools that the authors provide. However, I can say that the collection is comprehensive and current. I found several resources, such as Vocabulary Knowledge Rating (p. 38), Cinquan (p. 114), and Mathematics Writing Frames (p. 222), to be novel and relevant to promoting literacy in mathematics instruction. I found the exemplars and tools to be appropriate for grades 3-12, from order of operations to polynomials. Additionally, the teacher notes highlighting formative assessment connections support high- impact instruction. ",32,Window on Resources  October 2013
33,Window on Resources  October 2013,"Some resources, however, were less  novel. “Student Knowledge Cards”  (p. 14) sounded intriguing, but I felt this topic was little different from flash cards, and the “Memory Box” (p. 26) seemed to be a creative name for crib sheets.",33,Window on Resources  October 2013
34,Window on Resources  October 2013,"Although I appreciated the chapter structure of the “Four Styles of Mathematics Students,” I would encourage the reader to decide what would work from a learning objective and not from a student learning style. I understand the authors’ desire to make connections to the Standards for Mathematical Practice; however, I am not certain a classroom teacher would find the “Matrix” chart at the opening of each chapter particularly useful.",34,Window on Resources  October 2013
35,Window on Resources  October 2013,"The final section, Task Rotation  (p. 224), distinguishes this book from just a collection of resources. This is a rich model for classroom teachers in that it helps them differentiate instruction and use formative assessment concurrently. The author’s guidance in  designing a task rotation with “a hook or engaging point of entry” is spot on, and several solid exemplars are given.",35,Window on Resources  October 2013

The calculator would not accept this estimate. I then tried to round the 35 down to 30 and came up with the estimate of 1200. Again, the calculator would not accept the answer.

46,Window on Resources  October 2013,"I think most students would fi nd this calculator extremely frustrating to use as a primary computation tool because the estimates it accepts are not necessarily intuitive. Despite this, the calculator would be useful when students fi rst learn a computation algorithm or work with transcendental functions. Having students establish a habit of estimation might help to prevent careless errors when they perform computations both with and without a calculator.  —H.

If only for that reason, any seemingly superfl uous comments can be excused. Key to the strength of this resource are “ease the struggle” segments sprinkled throughout part 2. Although some of these segments defi ne the obvious, such as what it means to generalize and to overgeneralize, others are timely and clearly explained. These brief asides touch on Response to Intervention (RtI) tiers, Primary Number and Operations Assessment (PNOA), collaborative study, and conceptual versus procedural understandings. In addition to assessment strategies with researchbased foundations, this resource guides teachers in designing lessons that support learners with varied challenges. At the end of the book, reproducible black-line masters are provided to support differentiated lesson planning. Examples are also included that range from fi rst grade through seventh, covering a broad range of students’ needs. By offering tangible tools, templates, and forms that help implement the author’s recommendations, teachers and math specialists may have an essential resource that helps explain why some students do not comprehend the beauty and power of math.",48,Window on Resources  October 2013
