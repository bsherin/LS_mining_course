9,Window on Resources - February 2014,"This resource is for middle school  teachers of all levels because the concepts are adaptable. Although the book is organized by theme, I would recommend reading through the entire book before deciding how each cartoon fits into your particular curriculum. As stated in the book, the cartoons can be used for a variety of purposes, such as introducing a new concept, practicing or reviewing, developing general problem-solving skills, and as extension activities. I used “What’s My Number?” with my eighth-grade prealgebra classes as a tool to launch a discussion of proof and how we can show that something always works versus how we can prove if something does not always work. This activity could easily be adapted and used in a lesson to introduce the distributive property, to reinforce the importance of mental math skills, or to develop problem-solving strategies like making a table.",9,Window on Resources - February 2014

16,Window on Resources - February 2014,"Teachers, teacher educators, textbook writers, and mathematics curriculum policymakers at the secondary level will benefit from internationally researched knowledge about mathematics teaching and learning funded by the Nuffield Foundation. The authors identify seven key mathematical domains of research that include relations between quantities and algebraic expressions, ratio and proportional reasoning, connecting measurement and decimals, spatial and geometric reasoning, reasoning about data, reasoning about uncertainty, and functional relations between variables. Each chapter is devoted to, and includes a discussion of, the domain, what younger students learn, students’ learning and the learner’s progression, research into teaching and learning, and teaching approaches.",16,Window on Resources - February 2014
17,Window on Resources - February 2014,"The bottom-up approach of this book, identifying what mathematics  young students might already know before they arrive in secondary school, is especially benefi cial to secondary educators. Web resources hosted by the Nuffi eld Foundation are provided throughout that can be accessed through the associated website or Quick Response codes. The in-depth research-based approach to big ideas about mathematics teaching and learning presented in this book is a valuable resource as we strive to implement the Common Core.  —Winnie J.

Three of the icons lead to slides assisting in the development of the Common Core Standards for Mathematical Practices, modeling mathematics, and providing opportunities for class discussion  and group work. Another icon enables Flash® interactive activities that include both practice and assessment items. Students interact with text by clicking on essential academic vocabulary to reveal its defi nition. They can also drag vertices to change angle measures in triangles; roll dice to explore probability; and use highlighters, colored pens, a calculator, a protractor, and other math tools as needed to enable learning. A fi nal icon provides teacher notes with explanations, as well as other ideas for further exploration and extending the lesson. Some slides are editable, so the teacher can add district and local resources as needed.
