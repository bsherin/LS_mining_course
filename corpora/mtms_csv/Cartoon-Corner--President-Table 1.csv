In 1944, Franklin Roosevelt  received 25,612,916 popular votes, which were 1,701,029 fewer votes than he received in 1940. He received 438,703 fewer votes in 1940 than he received in 1936. The number of votes he received in 1936 was 4,931,371 more than he received in 1932. How many popular votes did he receive in 1932?

Encourage students to explain their reasoning in solving the problems.,7,Cartoon Corner: Presidential Puzzlers

9,Cartoon Corner: Presidential Puzzlers,Nate went in the other direction and added 17 to 1843 to  (incorrectly) obtain 1870. This answer is unreasonable because that would put Adams’s age at death at about 135.,9,Cartoon Corner: Presidential Puzzlers
10,Cartoon Corner: Presidential Puzzlers,c.  1826. Subtracting 17 from 1843  yields 1826.,10,Cartoon Corner: Presidential Puzzlers
11,Cartoon Corner: Presidential Puzzlers,"2.  A bit over 83 years old. A sample years solution: A person exactly 7  younger than Adams would have been born on October 30, 1742 (which is 7 years after October 30, 1735). Because Jefferson was about 7 1/2 years younger than Adams, Jefferson’s birthday was in early 1743. Jefferson died on July 4, 1826 (exactly 50 years after July 4, 1776). Because Jefferson was born in early 1743 and died in July, he lived to be a bit older than 83 years (1826 – 1743 = 83).  3.  a.  Obama received fewer electoral  votes in 2012 than in 2008 because 1.099 times as many votes in 2008 represents more than 100% of what he received in 2012.",11,Cartoon Corner: Presidential Puzzlers
12,Cartoon Corner: Presidential Puzzlers,"b.  332 electoral votes. If x = the number of popular votes that Obama received in 2012, write and solve 1.099x = 365. Thus,  x = 365 ÷ 1.099, or about 332.1.",12,Cartoon Corner: Presidential Puzzlers
13,Cartoon Corner: Presidential Puzzlers,"4.  22,821,277 popular votes. This  problem involves finding missing addends. One strategy is to make a table, such as the one below, to show the change from one election to the next. Column 2 shows the change in the number of votes from one election to the next (reading up). To complete  column 3,  inverse operations are used, working backward from  1944, as shown in column 4. Because the 1944 total was less than the 1940 total, add to find the 1940 total. In 1940, Roosevelt received    25,612,916 + 1,701,029  = 27,313,945 votes.",13,Cartoon Corner: Presidential Puzzlers

15,Cartoon Corner: Presidential Puzzlers,"  Because the 1936 total was more  than the 1932 total, subtract to find the 1932 total. In 1932, he received    27,752,648 – 4,931,371,  or 22,821,277 votes.",15,Cartoon Corner: Presidential Puzzlers

Therefore,  he delivered his speech on  August 28, 1963. Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863. There were 100 years from January 1, 1863, through December 31, 1962.  The total number of days in  100 years, excluding leap  days, is 100 × 365 = 36,500 days.    The leap years through 1963 were  1864, 1868, . . . , 1896, 1904,  1908, . . . , 1960.

28,Cartoon Corner: Presidential Puzzlers,"My eighth-grade students were studying the Constitution in history class when they completed “Presidential Puzzlers” in algebra. Before introducing the activity, they discussed the background information, including the popular vote versus the electoral vote. Often when encountering word problems in a textbook, their lack of understanding of the underlying context gets in the way. ",28,Cartoon Corner: Presidential Puzzlers
29,Cartoon Corner: Presidential Puzzlers,"Students played the parts of Nate  and his friend to start the conversation. Then the class worked in small groups to answer the questions. Initially, I had them do the computation by hand, but the size of the numbers in problem 4 not only slowed them down but also kept them from focusing on the process involved. Some students opted to use a calculator.",29,Cartoon Corner: Presidential Puzzlers
30,Cartoon Corner: Presidential Puzzlers,"As a follow-up activity, students researched voter participation trends for presidential elections for the past fifty years. They graphed their findings and discussed their results. For students accustomed to creating only linear graphs, the shape of the graph was surprising. It led to more discussion, including the historical context  of several of the elections. ",30,Cartoon Corner: Presidential Puzzlers
31,Cartoon Corner: Presidential Puzzlers,"My students sometimes ask if the information in math word problems is correct. Problem 2 provoked such a query. Adams’s famous last words, “Thomas Jefferson survives,” prompted even more surprise. (Adams was  unaware that his friend, Thomas  Jefferson, had died hours earlier.) Combining a bit of humor and a history lesson with math problems was  a hit.",31,Cartoon Corner: Presidential Puzzlers

35,Cartoon Corner: Presidential Puzzlers,"My sixth-grade prealgebra students love Big Nate and are anxious to identify errors in the mathematics of others! They had no difficulty explaining  the relationship between John Adams’s information and Thomas Jefferson’s— finding the characters’ confusion quite humorous. The calculations needed to figure out the electoral votes in 2012 provided a practical application of writing linear equations. My prealgebra students struggled with this, so every opportunity to reinforce how to write a verbal model algebraically is welcome.",35,Cartoon Corner: Presidential Puzzlers
36,Cartoon Corner: Presidential Puzzlers,Selecting an effective organizational  strategy for FDR’s change in number of votes during his four presidential elections proved to be the secret to success! Students paired with a partner and persevered by working backward in a table to calculate the number of votes he received in each election back to 1932.,36,Cartoon Corner: Presidential Puzzlers

I used the cartoon and question 1 as a warm up, and we did the other problems as a mixture of whole-class and pair discussions. We tried them out at the end of our unit on expressions and equations, so we paid special attention to writing expressions before solving and defining our variables accurately and completely. As a challenge, I did not allow students to use a calculator until we were verifying our answers. I also had students make predictions before they started calculating the number of days in problem 4.

48,Cartoon Corner: Presidential Puzzlers,"I tried this cartoon with my seventhgrade prealgebra class. I thought the questions were well done and that the class should have been able to complete them. But that did not happen. Everyone was able to do problems 1 and 2 with no problem. For problem 3, they multiplied 365 and 1.099 instead of  dividing by 1.099. So maybe you should begin by asking, “Did he have more or fewer electoral votes in 2012?” That question would trigger the thought that students should then be looking for a smaller number. For problem 4, many either subtracted when they should have added or added when they should have subtracted.",48,Cartoon Corner: Presidential Puzzlers
