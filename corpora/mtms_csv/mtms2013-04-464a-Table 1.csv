BUILDING THE CIRCLE MODEL,5,mtms2013-04-464a,,
"Figure 1 illustrates a model that has helped my students understand why a two-stage probability scenario involves multiplying probabilities. The circle’s sectors model the compound probabilities. In the introductory problem, four chocolates are in the box; one is milk chocolate and three are dark chocolates. The circle’s inner area is divided into fourths to show that the ﬁ rst grab of a chocolate could be one of these four chocolates. Each fourth is labeled milk or dark to show that 3/4 of the circle’s interior is dark chocolate and 1/4 is milk chocolate. This sectioning also demonstrates that the probability of getting the milk chocolate on the ﬁ rst draw is 1/4 and of getting a dark chocolate is 3/4. ",6,mtms2013-04-464a,,
"However, representing a single  selection does not complete the scenario. A second chocolate is chosen, so the circle must be divided to show the second selection, as well. This is why the ﬁ rst four chocolates are labeled near the center of the circle and why a second band of choices rings the center circle. ",7,mtms2013-04-464a,,
"With one chocolate removed from  the box, three chocolates remain. Thus, there are three possibilities for  ttt chocolate, then another. What is the probability that you will get two dark chocolates?",8,mtms2013-04-464a,,
"To solve this problem, students may use a memorized formula to determine the probability and other like probabilities. Students may choose a memorized formula because they have difﬁ culty understanding how to list the outcomes or how to analyze the situation (Shaughnessy 2003). Compound probability situations involve a ﬁ rst occurrence and then a second occurrence (or more than two occurrences). The schema about compound probabilities is not in most students’ experience base until they have had formal instruction . Thus, students’ intuitions often lead them to oversimplify a situation or depend on a formula that they do not understand. This type of probability, nonetheless, is important to comprehend (CCSSI 2010; NCTM 2000).",9,mtms2013-04-464a,,

Each of the four initial chocolate possibilities—or each 1/4 of the circle—is now subdivided into three smaller congruent sections. In the outer band, the second choices are labeled. The second choices depend on the ﬁ rst selection, so they must be labeled accordingly. If the milk chocolate is drawn ﬁ rst, the three second-choice possibilities are dark chocolates. If a dark chocolate is drawn ﬁ rst, the three second-choice possibilities are one milk chocolate and two dark chocolates. Note that each of the ﬁ rst choices is equally likely to be chosen; hence, the equal-size fourths subdividing the circle for the ﬁ rst selection. Similarly, each of the second choices is equally likely to be selected; hence, the equal-size thirds subdividing each of the initial fourths to create the sections for the second selection.",10,mtms2013-04-464a,,
"The circle’s interior is now divided into twelve congruent wedge-shaped sections, or twelfths. Each 1/12 signiﬁ es a pair of chocolates drawn, speciﬁ cally, an ordered pair of chocolates. Now we can answer the question being asked. Six of the twelve wedges infer that two dark chocolates are being selected. The probability of getting two dark chocolates for the two chocolates drawn is 6/12, or 1/2. (See ﬁ g. 2.)",11,mtms2013-04-464a,,
"How can this part of the problem be completed using calculations? We can see that the probability of getting a dark chocolate on the ﬁ rst selection is 3/4 because 3/4 of the circle’s interior shows the pairs of chocolates, in which the ﬁ rst selection is a dark chocolate. (See ﬁ g. 1.) Three-fourths of the time a dark chocolate will be chosen on the ﬁ rst draw. However, this “3/4 of the time” is not always a dark chocolate followed by a dark chocolate. Only 2/3 of this 3/4 circle is dark followed by dark. Only two of the three chocolates that remain in the box following the ﬁ rst draw (of a dark chocolate) are dark chocolates to be  dark dark milk dark",12,mtms2013-04-464a,,

"dark dark dark dark dark dark dark dark milk dark dark milk dark dark dark milk milk dark dark milk dark dark dark milk dark dark milk dark dark dark milk dark drawn on the second draw. Thus, only 2/3 of the time after a dark chocolate has been selected ﬁ rst will both chocolates selected be dark chocolate. ",15,mtms2013-04-464a,,
"The initial probability of getting  milk dark dark milk dark dark dark dark milk dark dark dark dark a dark chocolate on the ﬁ rst selection is 3/4. The probably of selecting two dark chocolates is reduced by the need to get a dark chocolate on the second dark selection. After taking a dark chocolate on the ﬁ rst draw, only 2/3 of the second draws are dark chocolate. So the probability of selecting two dark chocolates is 2/3 of the 3/4 probability that we get a dark chocolate on the ﬁ rst draw. (See ﬁ g. 2.) How can we calculate 2/3 of 3/4? We can multiply 3/4 by 2/3. This gives us less than the 3/4 probability that we started with because we are multiplying 3/4 by a number less than 1. We get 2/3 of a group of 3/4, or 2/3 of an amount of 3/4.",16,mtms2013-04-464a,,

UNDERSTANDING FRACTION MULTIPLICATION,18,mtms2013-04-464a,,
"Students often relate multiplying fractions, such as multiplying 2/3 by 3/4, to a circle model: Begin with 3/4 pizza, for example, and eat 2/3 of this amount of pizza. The portion eaten is less than the whole amount of 3/4 pizza, or 3/4 pizza less than one time. It is eating it 2/3 of  a time, so to speak, or it is eating 2/3 of the amount, or group, of 3/4 pizza. Students then draw a model showing 3/4 pizza, indicating (by shading or crossing out sections with an X) 2/3 this much pizza. (See ﬁ g. 3.) Students associate these models with multiplying 3/4 by 2/3, or with the calculation  × .",19,mtms2013-04-464a,,
"Either way, 6/12, or 1/2, pizza is the amount eaten.",20,mtms2013-04-464a,,
"The circle model helps students  understand why the calculation method for two-stage probability involves multiplying probabilities, which means multiplying (proper) fractions (or, occasionally, multiplying by 0 or 1). They think of multiplying any number by a proper fraction—by a fraction less than 1—as an operation that reduces the original number. This is what happens in these probability situations. The probability of taking the ﬁ rst chocolate is reduced when we must consider how much of that probability is followed by the second chocolate that is drawn. Only a fraction of that initial probability is the ﬁ nal probability that includes the two chocolates. ",21,mtms2013-04-464a,,
"Fig. 3 The circle model can be used to help make sense of fraction multiplication, as shown by this representation of 2/3 of 3/4 of a pizza.",22,mtms2013-04-464a,,
Fig. 4 This illustration models drawing two marbles with a replacement. It is similar to the models used with the Chocolate problem in that two rings are needed to show the possibilities.,23,mtms2013-04-464a,,

"In this situation, the circle model would be used as with the chocolate example. Speciﬁ cally, the circle would be divided into fourths, with 1/4 representing each of the four marbles. However, these fourths would themselves be divided into fourths because four marbles would be in the box to be chosen on each possible second random draw. (See ﬁ g. 4.)",25,mtms2013-04-464a,,
"With the marbles, 3/4 circle would represent a ﬁ rst draw of a red marble. Three of the fourths within each of these initial 3/4 would signify the draws of a red marble followed by a red marble. Thus, 3/4 of 3/4 of the circle’s interior is the fraction showing pairs of draws that are red, red. This can be calculated by × , (a) The Xs mark 2/3 of 3/4 of a pizza; in effect, taking 2/3 of each  1/4 of the pizza.",26,mtms2013-04-464a,,
(b) Each 1/4 pizza is viewed as  1/3 of the 3/4. The Xs are grouped  to denote 2/3 of 3/4 as 1/2.,27,mtms2013-04-464a,,
COMPOUND PROBABILITY WITH REPLACEMENT,28,mtms2013-04-464a,,
"Note that this model could be used in situations in which the item being taken from the container is returned to the container, such as in the following example involving drawing a marble from a box.",29,mtms2013-04-464a,,
"The Marble Problem  Suppose a box contained one white marble and three red marbles. If one marble was randomly drawn from the box, that marble returned, and a second marble randomly drawn from the box, what is the  to obtain 9/16 of the circle’s interior. The probability of drawing a red marble ﬁ rst is 3/4. The probability of drawing a red marble followed by a red marble is 3/4 of that probability, or 9/16. ",30,mtms2013-04-464a,,
THE VALUE OF THE CIRCLE MODEL,31,mtms2013-04-464a,,
The circle model offers students an additional representation to assist in their analysis and development of schema about these two-stage (or more) probability situations. It can help students build an understanding about how the probability of the desired second-stage outcome relates to (or proportionally reduces) the probability of the desired ﬁ rst-stage outcome to yield the desired two-stage outcome. It can reinforce understanding of the meaning of multiplying fractions less than 1. It can also relate a familiar model to an alternative context for fraction multiplication.,32,mtms2013-04-464a,,
