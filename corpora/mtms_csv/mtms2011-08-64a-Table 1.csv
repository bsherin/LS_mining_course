"Hurricane season lasts from May 15 to November 30. Hurricanes such as Earl (2010) leave behind little destruction; others, like Katrina (2005), are very destructive. To predict the strength of a hurricane, researchers gather data, such as wind speed (in knots, kt) and pressure (in millibars, mb), and use mathematics to interpret these data. ",4,mtms2011-08-64a,,
"PROBLEMS 1.  From each table, convert the wind speeds of Hurricane Fran (1996) and Hurricane Carlos (2009) from knots, which are in nautical miles per hour (kt), to miles, or miles per hour (mph) (1 kt = 1.15 mph). Then make a new table for each hurricane that includes pressure (in mb) and wind speed (in mph).",5,mtms2011-08-64a,,
"2.  Using the data in the two tables, make a scatter plot for each hur-",6,mtms2011-08-64a,,

"ricane (making the x-axis pressure and the y-axis wind speed, in mph). The data should form a linear pattern. Find the equation and slope for the line of best ﬁ t for each graph. Explain in words what the equation and slope mean.",8,mtms2011-08-64a,,
"3.  Use one of your mathematical  models to ﬁ nd the wind speeds (in mph) based on each of these pressures: 900, 1020, and 1070. Discuss the reasonableness of your results.",9,mtms2011-08-64a,,
Extension: The Safﬁ r-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale (http://www.nhc .noaa.gov/sshws.shtml) uses top wind speed to categorize hurricane level. Determine the categories of Hurricane Fran and Hurricane Carlos. Explain why you chose that category level.,10,mtms2011-08-64a,,
