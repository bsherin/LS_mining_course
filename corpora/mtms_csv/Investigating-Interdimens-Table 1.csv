0,Investigating Interdimensional Relationships - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The phrase interdimensional relationships may conjure images of UFOs, alien beings, wormholes, and even mystical powers. These notions of interdimensionality were not out of bounds in the middle school learners experiences described in this article. However, these notions do not entirely capture the mathematical relationships investigated with my former fifth and sixth graders. These students questioned the idea of dimension when given opportunities to play with spatial phenomena.",,
1,Investigating Interdimensional Relationships - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The topic of dimension played a role in a pivotal event that changed me as a middle school mathematics teacher and continues to shape my growing understanding concerning teaching and learning. As if yesterday, I clearly remember one of my students bringing in the film Flatland: The Movie (Caplan, Johnson, and Travis 2007), following a month-long investigation into properties and measurement of polygons. Students were excited from the moment the animated film began. After the last scene ended, hinting at a possible fourth dimension, the incessant questioning began. Students mainly asked, Is there a fourth dimension? At the time, I had never given much thought to higher dimensions and could not answer their questions; however, I could certainly allow them to conjecture. Wondering about ones own dimensionality, hypothesizing about higher and lower dimensional spaces and the relationships among them, constructing spatial modelsa learning environment that incorporated all these questions would turn out to drive my own future inquiry into teaching and learning, leading to my current work as a mathematics teacher educator.",,
2,Investigating Interdimensional Relationships - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In this article, I seek to share with other middle school mathematics teachers the ways in which fifth-grade and sixth-grade middle school students found their world problematized the moment they were, in the words of one student, no longer the highest, or the best, or . . . you know. They came to realize that dimensionality is something they had not fully considered, especially relationships and patterns between dimensions and the ways that they connected to their lives as spatial beings. For students, prototypical images, technical vocabulary, and measurement formulas constituted their current understanding. Yet, students did not necessarily see these mathematical notions as something that connected to their world of navigating, seeing, and perceiving. After viewing Flatland: The Movie and working through a series of investigations, students concepts of dimension and space shifted as they explored relationships between dimensions and considered life and living in different dimensions. They even went as far as to conjecture what it might be like to see and perceive higher dimensions. This article aims to support other middle school teachers who may want to engage their students with investigations to consider the complex, human aspect of space and dimension.",,

4,Investigating Interdimensional Relationships - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Gravemeijer and Cobb (2006) argue that you have to understand the innovative forms of education that you might want to bring about in order to produce them (p. 17). The innovative form that this project sought to bring about involves supporting learners grasping of space, a concept that Freudenthal advocated (1973):",,
5,Investigating Interdimensional Relationships - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"And since it is about the education of children, [geometry] is grasping that space in which the child lives, breathes and moves. The space the child must learn to know, explore, conquer, in order to live, breath and move better in it. Are we so accustomed to this space that we cannot imagine how important it is for us and for those we are educating? (p. 403)",,
6,Investigating Interdimensional Relationships - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The importance that Freudenthal allocates to this idea of grasping space is emphasized time and time again from those in geometry education. For example, Lehrer and Chazan (1998) suggested,",,
7,Investigating Interdimensional Relationships - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Reintegrating spatial reasoning into the mathematical mainstream (indeed, placing it at the core of K12 mathematics environments that promote learning with understanding) will mean increased attention to problems in modeling, structure, and design and re-invigoration of traditional topics like measure, dimension, and form: Geometry education should include contributions to the mathematics of space that were developed after those of the Greeks. (p. ix)",,
8,Investigating Interdimensional Relationships - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Although Lehrer and Chazan suggested that geometry education should include concepts beyond Euclidean notions, such concepts are difficult to find in the current Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSI 2010). In middle school and high school geometry strands, for example, investigating dimensional relationships focuses on two-dimensional cross sections related to three-dimensional solids. However, this does not account for the way that adolescent learners seemed to wonder, question, and conjecture about dimension. They wanted to explore questions concerning their own three-dimensional being and the limits of their sight and perception related to the fourth dimension as well as imagine themselves as other-than-three-dimensional beings. This desire to consider their position, relationship, and dimensionality can be leveraged by teachers to help students make sense of space and dimension.",,

10,Investigating Interdimensional Relationships - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The design of learning environment activities and students engagement in discussion and modeling are shared in this section, with a focus on activities that promoted student discourse. Data originate from investigations with grades 56 students. For two years, I was the sole fifth-grade and sixth-grade mathematics teacher, looping with my fifth-grade students during the second year. During the third year, although no longer teaching at the school, I interviewed my former students to better understand their experiences investigating space, perspective, and dimension.",,
11,Investigating Interdimensional Relationships - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,LEARNING ENVIRONMENT DESIGN,,
12,Investigating Interdimensional Relationships - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"During the first week of school, students were invited to construct sociomathematical norms (Yackel and Cobb 1996), which would guide our collective expectations for doing mathematics as a community. These norms included raising questions about mathematical phenomena, sharing and listening to one anothers strategies, and making their conjecturing and justification activity public. For teachers seeking to integrate Flatland: The Movie, additional considerations might be beneficial:",,
13,Investigating Interdimensional Relationships - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Allow Flatland: The Movie and dimension to be problematic. Hiebert and his colleagues (1996) wrote that allowing the subject to be problematic means allowing students to wonder why things are, to inquire, to search for solutions, and to resolve incongruities (p. 12).",,
14,Investigating Interdimensional Relationships - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Encourage students to share ideas and engage with the reasoning of others. This can be done by asking students to jot down questions they have after watching the film and by using talk moves and questions (e.g., turn-and-talk, press for reasoning, What do you think about that? Do you agree or disagree . . . and why?). Elaboration of each of these talk moves can be found in Chapin, OConnor, and Anderson (2009).",,
15,Investigating Interdimensional Relationships - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Provide opportunities to model dimensional solids and mathematize relations between dimensions (see activities 2 and 3 below).,,
16,Investigating Interdimensional Relationships - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Activity 1: Watching Flatland: The Movie and Whole-Class Discussion,,
17,Investigating Interdimensional Relationships - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"After watching the film Flatland: The Movie, students seemed eager to share their thoughts about perspective, dimension, and the problematic aspects of being a three-dimensional human, namely, the inability to fully imagine or embody other dimensions:",,
18,Investigating Interdimensional Relationships - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Flatland itself I remember. It was just sort of weird to think about it being in only two dimensions. I know what that is like because I have seen books with pictures of two-dimensional drawings. Yet, thinking about actually living only on this flat surface seems somewhat crazy to me. I vaguely remember thinking, How do they move? Do they slide along on the floor or what? Or do they crawl? Didnt he say that they have only northward and southward or something? That they do not have up and down? Yes, because everything is flat.",,
19,Investigating Interdimensional Relationships - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Flatland caused students to conjecture what it might be like to see, move, perceive, eatbein the fourth dimension. Below is a conjecture by fifth grader Alan, who distinguishes between seeing and perceiving among the dimensions:",,
20,Investigating Interdimensional Relationships - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Assuming that any creature . . . can see the dimension below it, but perceive its own. Well, that would imply the fourth-dimensional creature would have to be able to see a third dimension. So basically what I imagine a fourth-dimensional creature being like is a sphere with eyes on the inside of it, so it could look at something from every angle. And it would have to have some way of getting things in there to look at, but I havent gotten past that. Yeah, youd have to be able to see all sides at once. First [I] . . . could imagine seeing all three sides of a cubeall six sides of a cube at once.",,
21,Investigating Interdimensional Relationships - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Although Alan articulates this relationship between seeing and perceiving more precisely than most of his classmates, this is an understanding that students realized year after year. It seems that Flatland: The Movie, by comparing the zero, first, second, and third dimensions in this way, gives students a method for extending the pattern to conjecture the sight and perception of a four-dimensional being. Additionally, after considering the possibility of a fourth dimension, all classes extended this notion to the possibility of infinite dimensions.",,
22,Investigating Interdimensional Relationships - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Flatland: The Movie raised other questions and conjectures, such as attempting to find a truly two-dimensional object in our three-dimensional space. Students contributed examples that might work, such as shadows and projections. However, many students felt like the second dimension was just as off limits as the fourth dimension in terms of being able to see and experience it. Even such examples as flat paper models were scrutinized for their height, no matter their approximation to being flat. Most students argued that we would not be able to see truly two-dimensional objects.",,
23,Investigating Interdimensional Relationships - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Activity 2: Exploring the Fourth Dimension with Models,,
24,Investigating Interdimensional Relationships - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Students seemed most interested in understanding the fourth dimension.They remembered the last scene of Flatland: The Movie, in which Spherius, the three-dimensional visitor, considers the Flatlanders questions about a fourth dimension absurd. This is followed by a short animation of a hypercube in motion. After taking time to discuss questions stemming from Flatland: The Movie, I let students know that we would create our own four-dimensional models. Using straws, pipe cleaners, and scissors, students were free to create any solid they wished. Most made several, ranging from cubes, rectangular prisms, pentagonal and hexagonal prisms, and triangular and square pyramids. A few students even constructed a hypercube in hopes that they would be able to model the fifth dimension. To create the four-dimensional model, the solids were submerged in bubble solution, and then a bubble was blown into the middle of the solid (see fig. 1).",,
25,Investigating Interdimensional Relationships - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
26,Investigating Interdimensional Relationships - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,The bubble and straw activity led Lynn to wonder what a four-dimensional person might look like:,,
27,Investigating Interdimensional Relationships - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The experiment we did with bubbles was cool. And kind of just with the fourth dimension. Something that I always think about it, is like when we did the bubbles and we kind of tried to experience the fourth dimension. Like [I] just did it with a cube. But how would it look like with a person or, like, the shape of a person? Like ahhh, what?!?",,
28,Investigating Interdimensional Relationships - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Other students wondered about these embodied aspects of dimensions, conjecturing about eating a four-dimensional cheeseburger, with each bite possibly creating a cross section different from ours in three dimensions. It seems that viewing Flatland: The Movie combined with the bubble activity spurred students to consider not only the way dimensions are constructed or related but also the way they might be embodied differently by different dimensional beings. For example, Alan remembers considering the dimensional aspects of sight:",,
29,Investigating Interdimensional Relationships - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The movie, Flatland, helped me understand the fourth dimension, since the only thing I couldnt really understand about it was why we couldnt see it. Flatland explained that, by showing that a creature can only see in the dimension below its existence.",,
30,Investigating Interdimensional Relationships - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Activity 3: Connecting Dimensions with Analogy,,
31,Investigating Interdimensional Relationships - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"After constructing models of four-dimensional shapes, we explored both arithmetic and geometric progressions. As indicated in figure 2, finding patterns in the bounding objects from one dimension to the next represents an arithmetic progression (constant difference between numbers in the sequence; linear growth).",,
32,Investigating Interdimensional Relationships - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
33,Investigating Interdimensional Relationships - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Using a two-dimensional square, we can say the square is bounded by four edges (lines), and a three-dimensional cube is bounded by six faces (squares). Investigating the number of terminal points across dimensions consists of a geometric progression (common ratio between numbers in the sequence; exponential growth). Terminal points in this case refer to the number of vertices (e.g., a square has four vertices, a cube has eight vertices). This investigation into patterns between dimensions spurred students to consider the possibility of an infinite number of dimensions. Although students were able to extend the pattern to the fourth dimension, fifth dimension, and even the sixth dimension, they did not have words for the objects that might serve as boundaries for the extra-dimensional objects. In both cases, we used the example of a square or cube. However, many students asked about other prisms and even searched for patterns with pyramids.",,
34,Investigating Interdimensional Relationships - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Although students found it easy to continue the pattern, describing the geometric progression rule for x dimensions was difficult for all students. When investigating analogies using algebraic relationships, it will be important to support students to work with figures or models and tables as well as to generalize patterns in words and expressions. Extending the investigation in this way gave students an opportunity to consider, for example, the number of vertices of a seven-dimensional cube.",,
35,Investigating Interdimensional Relationships - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,SHIFTING STUDENTS DISPOSITIONS TOWARD MATH,,
36,Investigating Interdimensional Relationships - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In an era of accountability, it seems at times we forget that mathematics is a human activity and one that can support our understanding of being in the world. Notions of equity and access are not asides, but should guide our practice as teachers and teacher educators. Part of seriously considering access and equity means honoring where students are and the questions they raise. Oftentimes, school notions of geometry do not resonate with adolescent students.",,
37,Investigating Interdimensional Relationships - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In this article, I attempted to show how geometry might be a viable context to help students explore complex notions of dimension, such as the fourth, without necessarily prioritizing a formalization, definition, or rule. Although our investigation into space, perspective, and dimension did not necessarily lead to standardized, measureable results, students dispositions toward mathematics broadly shifted. They saw themselves as capable, as mathematicians able to generate questions to guide mathematical investigations. I end this article with Marys reflection:",,
38,Investigating Interdimensional Relationships - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I loved learning about the fourth dimension because its cool learning about something that you dont actually know all the answers to. So its fun to sort of think about what the answers could be. . . . You can have your own ideas, and its not just somebody telling you, OK, this did this, and now you have to learn it. . . . I would tell middle school teachers that wanted to teach it to let the kids have their own ideas and their own thoughts about it. Let everybody say what they think the fourth dimension is and how it contrasts to the third dimension.",,
