0,How Do They Grow_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Students have great difficulties moving from procedural algebra to structural algebra (Boaler 2013). Procedural  algebra can be described as using a letter to represent a single unknown number that students find, such as the value of x when 7x + 4 = 32. In contrast, structural algebra requires using symbols to express generality in a situation and asking such open-ended questions as Describe how the pattern is growing or Can you find the number of squares in case n? Boaler asserts that analyzing geometric growth patterns using multiple representations (manipulatives, words, pictures, graphs, tables, and symbols) supports the understanding of structural algebra because making connections and seeing different representations lead to deeper learning and can unleash incredible understanding.",,
1,How Do They Grow_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Hence, I decided to try a growing patterns investigation that would strengthen my students transition to structural algebra. I wanted students to model their thinking with multiple representations, to articulate ideas about their observations and reasoning, to represent concrete ideas in abstract ways, and to use patterns and structures to make conjectures and generalizations. These, and my choice of having students use pattern blocks, support the goals of the Common Core State Standards for School Mathematics for students in the middle grades (CCSSI 2010).",,
2,How Do They Grow_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Using pattern blocks,,
3,How Do They Grow_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Students experiences with pattern blocks begin as early as preschool. At that time, they begin to develop an understanding of repetition by alternating the colored shapes to create AB, AAB, or ABC patterns. They experiment with area and symmetry by covering polygonal spaces using the fewest (or the greatest) number of pattern blocks possible or by creating  symmetrical designs. Elementary school students use these same  manipulatives to learn basic fractional relationships. As they mature mathematically, students may construct pattern block protractors to explore angle measurement. These lesson ideas are just some of the many possibilities that can illustrate the versatility of the colorful polygons in the elementary grades. However, as students progress through the middle school years and beyond, their mathematical experiences are less likely to cross paths with pattern blocks as the popularity and functionality of these manipulatives dwindle.",,
4,How Do They Grow_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The activities that follow introduce a more advanced application for pattern blocks because they require students to examine sets of geometric patterns in concert rather than in isolation. Before working on these activities, students had previously explored growing square tile patterns in Core Connections (Dietiker 2013), toothpick patterns in MathLinks (Goldstein et al. 2013), and used multiple representations to show solutions. Still, the idea that these various representations are interrelated was not evident to all learners, so one of my goals for the lesson was to help students make these connections.",,
5,How Do They Grow_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Getting started,,
6,How Do They Grow_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The complete Growing Pattern Blocks activity contains nine sets of pattern block patterns (see fig. 1) and attempts to follow Bruners three sequential stages of representationenactive (concrete manipulatives), iconic (visual representations), and symbolic (words and symbols) (Castellanos, DeHart, and Zhang n.d.). We began the lesson at the enactive stage by building the first four figures of growing hexagons with yellow pattern blocks (see fig. 1, set 1, pattern A). The class almost immediately recognized that the number of hexagons increases by 1 with each increasing figure, and students correctly predicted that figure 100 in the pattern would have 101 hexagons joined together horizontally. Furthermore, they were able to articulate that figure n would have (n + 1) hexagons in a row. Next, in the iconic stage of representation, I asked students to draw the hexagon pattern on paper and outline the perimeter of each figure with a dark marker. After that, I asked, How do you see the perimeter growing? and gave students some thinking time to prepare their responses. We defined each side of the hexagon as having a length of 1 unit so that the perimeter of the starting figure was 6 units. Many students were more occupied with determining the perimeters by ticking and counting the sides of each outlined figure, but I redirected their focus by reminding them that we were interested for the moment in how the visual pattern was growing from one figure to the next. Strategies that emerged during whole-class sharing are recorded and shown in table 1.",,

8,How Do They Grow_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
9,How Do They Grow_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"To emphasize that the representations are interrelated, we then recorded the numerical data in a table, showing the decomposition of each perimeter so that the patterns would pop out and that they match the visual explanations. In line with Bruners symbolic stage of representation, we also generated rules (as seen in table 1) to express the growth symbolically based on the ways that the patterns were broken down using the other representations. Students then used properties of arithmetic to simplify and reconcile the algebraic expressions for the perimeter of the nth figure.",,
10,How Do They Grow_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Giving students an ongoing platform to share their own ways of describing perimeter growth patterns and learning from one anothers strategies were valuable components of this lesson. Students saw that there is not just one single way to describe each geometric pattern; although the methods of decomposition varied, the results were all the same.",,
11,How Do They Grow_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Synthesizing the patterns,,
12,How Do They Grow_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The remaining patterns found in set 1B (trapezoids), C (squares), and D (triangles)were completed in a similar format. As some students began to see trends among the four patterns within the set using the various representations, they became more efficient. Specifically, some learners noted early on that the patterns were intentionally sorted in order by descending starting perimeters and that each color pattern had a different rate of change. However, most students were still relying on physically counting the perimeter of each figure.",,
13,How Do They Grow_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"When I saw this yet again, I reminded students to focus on how the perimeters were changing from one figure to the next and to record the perimeter for each figure in decomposed form just as with the growing hexagons (set 1, pattern A). They were also reminded to count only to double-check their answers. The process eventually became easier for students, and the urge to count the perimeters one by one waned by the time they completed the triangles pattern (set 1, pattern C). In so doing, students gained more confidence and learned to trust that the patterns they discovered were correct.",,
14,How Do They Grow_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"To summarize our work with multiple representations with Growing Pattern Blocks patterns in set 1, we graphed all the data points from our  T tables on one graph. To create a more distinct visual effect, a different color was used for each pattern. A challenge that students encountered was determining an appropriate scale for the graph so that all the data points could fit and yet not cram the figure number horizontally. We discussed trends in the graphs (a student observed that the hexagon line was the steepest, followed by the trapezoid, the square, and the triangle), compared their y-intercepts and rates of change, and used extrapolation to project the perimeters for figures 5, 6, and 7 in each pattern (most students used their fingers to count spaces on the graph paper rather than drawing extensions of the lines.) Students then extended the T tables and used the algebraic expressions to verify their solutions, thus reinforcing the connections among the visual, numerical, verbal, and symbolic representations.",,
15,How Do They Grow_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Collaborative work,,
16,How Do They Grow_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In the next class session, I assigned a different Start with . . .  and an  Add . . . pattern set (see fig. 1, sets 29) to each student group. Students spent approximately ten minutes independently examining the picture patterns assigned to their group, recording their observations, and making conjectures about the growth of perimeters in symbolic form.  Afterward, they compared results within the group and worked collaboratively to prepare poster presentations of their solutions, including pictures, numbers, symbols, and graphs (see fig. 2). Some supplies available to students during collaborative work included pattern blocks (pieces, stickers, and templates), poster paper (graph and plain), colored markers, and a color printer. Although students were encouraged to use manipulatives to build the figures, they did not feel the need to physically re-create the figures because the Growing Pattern Blocks patterns were simple enough. They proceeded directly to drawing the figures on the poster paper and making hatch marks on the sides as they calculated the perimeters. Individual presentation preferences emerged, creating a mosaic of unique work. Although some groups traced with physical pattern blocks or the templates, others chose to use pattern block stickers to replicate the picture patterns. One group with a highly computer-proficient learner used an online pattern block applet to re-create the figures on the computer, made a screen capture of the images, and printed them. Once groups completed their work, they compared their finished products to check the validity of their earlier conjectures.",,
17,How Do They Grow_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
18,How Do They Grow_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Gallery walk,,
19,How Do They Grow_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The lesson culminated in a gallery walk in which students exhibited their work around the room. By displaying posters of their graphs on one side of the room and the posters of other representations on the opposite side of the room, students made observations and matched sets of corresponding posters to demonstrate their understanding about y-intercepts and slopes. They were directed to examine the various graphical representations on the posters and determine which were Start with  . . . sets and which were Add . . . sets based on common rates of change or common y-intercepts. Each owner group then confirmed the conjectures for the class by revealing the complementary posters. This was a lengthy process, but students were eager to learn the validity of their conjectures. They were also excited when the answers were announced. Here are some questions I asked of the group during the gallery walk discussion:",,
20,How Do They Grow_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,How do you see the patterns  growing?,,
21,How Do They Grow_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,How are the patterns in set [number] alike? How are they different?,,
22,How Do They Grow_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Can you predict what is the rule for pattern [letter] in set [number]? How do you know?,,
23,How Do They Grow_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In looking at the graphs, can you tell which are Add [shape] sets or Start with [shape] sets? How can you tell from the graphs? How can you tell from the T-tables? How can you tell from the symbolic rules?",,
24,How Do They Grow_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"What are the perimeters of figures 5, 6, and 7? Did you figure this out by looking at the pictures, the table, the graph, and the equation or by building it yourself?",,
25,How Do They Grow_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,What is the perimeter of figure 100? How do you know?,,
26,How Do They Grow_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,I asked these questions of the class:,,
27,How Do They Grow_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Do the patterns represent discrete or continuous graphs? Why?,,
28,How Do They Grow_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"What similarities do you see in  sets 2, 3, 4, and 5?",,
29,How Do They Grow_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"What similarities do you see in  sets 6, 7, 8, and 9?",,
30,How Do They Grow_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Error alert,,
31,How Do They Grow_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Two student errors emerged as a result of this lesson. The first involved confusing the perimeter of the red trapezoid with its physical description by making the number of sides in the polygon synonymous with its perimeter. A few students described the red pattern block as having five sides rather than a perimeter of five units. This was not surprising because for all of the other shapes (hexagon, square, and triangle), the side length is one unit.",,
32,How Do They Grow_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"These students may have used the label side to mean a unit of length and incorrectly thought that the trapezoid had a perimeter that was five sides long. Hence, I corrected this oversight by creating parallel chains of trapezoids and triangles with equal lengths and asking a series of questions to guide the students thinking, as shown in figure 3. Students could see that the length produced with each color of pattern blocks was equal, yet the number of sides lined up was unequal.",,
33,How Do They Grow_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
34,How Do They Grow_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"At that moment, the students who had confused the number of sides and the perimeter of the trapezoid discovered the flaw in their own thinking. I asked the students to confirm their response by physically counting the perimeter.",,
35,How Do They Grow_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The second error created a teachable moment and revealed that students had the natural urge to connect the data points with solid lines. I explained the difference between discrete and continuous graphs and how in the context of this activity, the input (i.e., the figure number) can consist of only nonnegative integers because it makes no sense to have fractional figure numbers. I supported this simplified explanation with some real-life examples, such as the cost of bananas sold by the pound (continuous) versus sold by the unit (discrete) to solidify the difference between the two. We verbally generated a short list of other applicable situations and decided if these items would produce continuous or discrete graphs.",,
36,How Do They Grow_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Extending the task,,
37,How Do They Grow_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"As an extension, students used the pattern blocks to work backward and reconstruct patterns that would fit given verbal criteria, such as use the pattern block pieces to create a pattern in which the initial figure has a perimeter of 4 units and increases by  3 units in each figure thereafter. I was pleasantly surprised to realize that this exercise was not as challenging for them as I had anticipated. Many of the students were able to describe the sequence of figures without creating the pattern with physical manipulatives.",,
38,How Do They Grow_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Learners can also explore how attributes change in slightly more intricate growing patterns. Figure 4 shows two geometric patterns created by students who completed their group posters earlier than others (because of time constraints, we did not explore how these figures were growing.) Classroom discourse will continue to focus on the question How do you see the shapes growing? to promote fluency with recognition and decomposition of patterns. When students are presented with interesting problems in context, they observe patterns and relationships: They conjecture, test, discuss, verbalize, generalize, and represent these patterns and relationships (Ferrini-Mundy, Lappan, and Phillips 1997).",,
39,How Do They Grow_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
40,How Do They Grow_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The Growing Pattern Blocks  pattern investigation presented  here provided an engaging way to  strengthen my students experiences with structural algebra and to solidify their understanding of multiple representations. Investigating patterns allowed learners to become more fluent problem solvers as they continue to work toward mathematical sophistication by practicing exploration, flexibility, and perseverance.",,
