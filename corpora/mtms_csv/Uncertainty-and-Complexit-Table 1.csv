0,Uncertainty and Complexity in Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Proclaiming that all mathematics teachers use models would not be an overstatement. Modeling is an effective tool to help students access mathematical concepts. Finding a math teacher who has not drawn a fraction bar or pie chart on the board would be difficult, as would finding students who have not been asked to draw models and represent numbers in different ways. During the authors combined years of teaching, our view of modeling and its connection to mathematics has changed. In our last three years of teaching together, models emerged as the central focus of a twelve-week unit of instruction, and we used models to think about how mathematics functions in and represents the world. This focus on models contributed to a shift in how students thought about mathematics and themselves as mathematicians. Modeling and the uncertainty inherent in it created a space of equity in our classrooms in which all students were creators of knowledge.",,
1,Uncertainty and Complexity in Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In our years of teaching eighth grade, we often met students who entered our classrooms either bored because they already knew the math or deflated from years of getting the wrong answers in math classes. Inevitably, during parent-teacher conferences at the beginning of the school year, more than a few parents would tell us that their child disliked math. However, in the years since we began the modeling unit, many students who disliked math at the beginning of the year would end the year enthused about it.",,
2,Uncertainty and Complexity in Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"This change in students attitudes did not happen because we put an intervention in place for math fact fluency (although this was a practice at our school) or because we enforced stricter procedures to ensure more time on task. We believe that these changes in attitude occurred because students who had been taught that mathematics concerned only speed and accuracy came to view math as a complex subject that went beyond procedures. The students looked on us as being decidedly uncertain in class, and they learned that they could be uncertain, too. In this article, we will discuss (1) the properties of models and how they can function in the classroom; (2) the Hobby project, a performance assessment for systems of equations and modeling; and (3) a particular piece of student work that demonstrates the potential power of uncertainty in mathematics classrooms.",,
3,Uncertainty and Complexity in Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,PROPERTIES OF MODELS,,
4,Uncertainty and Complexity in Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Models are inherently uncertain things. They are abstractions. They cannot completely represent the item that they intend to represent. To make a model, a student must make decisions about what he or she thinks are the important attributes to represent and how best to represent them. She has to decide what can be left out and what can be an estimation or approximation. Creating a modelwhether it is the graph of a line, a pie chart, or something else entirelyis complex work. The great thing about modeling is that models are everywhere. Students just do not realize it.",,
5,Uncertainty and Complexity in Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In our classrooms, we used a project from earlier in the year as a jumping-off point to discuss modeling. However, you could build from any prior knowledge that your students bring to the classroom or that you have shared during the year. You might draw on previous experience in mathematics classrooms at your school or models that exist in the school building. For example, we discussed why mathematicians use letters (and most often particular letters) to represent variables in mathematical equations. What reasons might students give if asked this question? Is it a clarity issue? How might different letters work or not work? Could we try it out and see what we notice? Aside from mathematical examples, most classrooms or schools have models that are not so obvious. An emergency evacuation route sign is a good example of a model found in most classrooms. How are such signs simplified? Why? Using the examples of models as references, we introduced and agreed on a language of modeling (see fig. 1). We discussed how a model loses something in its representation and that the modeler must determine what is important to show and what can be left out. These decisions about what to focus on in a model are complex; there is not one right answer. Mathematicians tackle messy problems by mapping relationships and using inexact approximations that fit particular characteristics or attributes that are deemed most important. The mathematician makes an approximation and accepts the resulting uncertainty.",,
6,Uncertainty and Complexity in Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
7,Uncertainty and Complexity in Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"When we gave students the lens to view mathematics as modeling, we considered how we had already been using models in mathematics. When we graph a line in slope intercept form and use t tables, the line is a model. Although our students could graph lines, we wanted them to think about how the line works as a model. What does it represent? How well does it fit what it represents? How well would the audience understand the situation by looking at the model? Instead of just following conventions that tell us to label axes, students began to see that the decision to label an axis in a particular way affects how the audience reads the model. Students saw themselves as creators of models to be read rather than as producers of graphs to be graded.",,
8,Uncertainty and Complexity in Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In paying more attention to the context of problems and how to represent them, students noticed that some relationships between two variables are difficult to model with a straight line. For example, if the line y = 7.49x + 49 represents a typical eighth-grade problem of the cost of x t-shirts produced by a company that charges a $49.00 set-up fee and $7.49 per shirt, might the equation and line fail to capture some details? How might our model have to change if the company includes an extra charge for XXL shirts? What if we ordered a very small number of shirts or a very large number of shirts; might the company think differently about the pricing? And how might the line reflect that change?",,
9,Uncertainty and Complexity in Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"When we encouraged uncertainty, we gave students space to be discerning communicators rather than rule followers. The students articulated why they would include the units on the x-axis, why they might choose a particular scale, and how using a different scale would produce a different effect. We could give students a checklist to assist them in these skills, but that would get to the surface aspects of mathematical communication only, and it would position the teachers as knowers who tell students the right way to make a graph. Uncertainty allowed the students participation in the mathematics to be more complex. To encourage reflection, we prompted students with questions adapted from Models-Based Science Teaching, outlined in figure 2.",,

11,Uncertainty and Complexity in Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,THE HOBBY PROJECT: ASSESSING MODELING,,
12,Uncertainty and Complexity in Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
13,Uncertainty and Complexity in Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"To assess our students knowledge of modeling and systems of equations, our team created a culminating performance assessment for the modeling unit, called the Hobby project (see fig. 3). Students select a hobby that they might want to pursue, research the hobby, and consider two scenarios: a high or a low initial cost. For example, if they choose sewing or fashion design, their high initial cost might include buying a sewing machine (a high initial cost) and then watching YouTube videos on sewing and buying fabric (low continuing costs). A low initial-cost option might involve a student finding a class that includes the use of a sewing machine (a low initial cost), but he or she would have to continue to pay for the lessons (higher continuing costs). For the assessment, students research the costs for each option, write equations to represent the scenarios, and create a graph to represent their spending over time. Students made connections between their verbal models and their mathematical models to map the relationship and represent the expenses for their hobby (see fig. 4).",,
14,Uncertainty and Complexity in Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
15,Uncertainty and Complexity in Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"When students write their equations, they create a particular model of the scenario. If the lessons they are taking cost $19.00 each and their upfront costs are $46.23, they must consider how to represent this information with an equation. There is uncertainty here. Consider a few options:",,

23,Uncertainty and Complexity in Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,There is not one right way to represent the situation. Students must consider whether the equation is a good fit for the scenario and what effect approximations would have.,,
24,Uncertainty and Complexity in Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"When students work on their graph, they have a similar variety of options in how they communicate, yet they are working with a different type of model for a different purpose. Perhaps students would decide that it would make the model more effective to round when graphing and setting up their scale, but they decide that accuracy is more important for their equation model, so they do not approximate there. Both the graph and equation are models of the situation, but they serve different purposes.",,
25,Uncertainty and Complexity in Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Throughout the process, we asked students to justify their representation choices (see fig. 5). Students should be weighing their options. How might each option work for their particular goals and to reach their particular audience? With the Hobby project, students were asked to consider multiple audiences: parents, classmates, and other school community members.",,
26,Uncertainty and Complexity in Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
27,Uncertainty and Complexity in Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,The acceptance and cultivation of uncertainty has led to deeper conceptual understanding of mathematical concepts and representations. One particular example of a students work on the Hobby project helped us see how our cultivation of uncertainty allowed a different type of mathematical thinking to enter our classrooms.,,
28,Uncertainty and Complexity in Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,DANTE AND THE LION,,
29,Uncertainty and Complexity in Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Dante (a pseudonym) chose lion taming as his hobby. He had to be creative in considering some of the costs. He wrote his equations, modeled them effectively (see fig. 6a), and plotted his systems of equations (see fig. 6b). He completed his work quickly, and we knew he understood, so we challenged him to consider an alternative scenario and complete another graph.",,
30,Uncertainty and Complexity in Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
31,Uncertainty and Complexity in Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The next day, Dante brought in his graph (see fig. 7). The line did not model a simple direct linear relationship like those we had been working on as a class. It went up in starts and fits and then went flat and up again and across until eventually it crashed back down. The graph showed a complex series of events, beginning with the purchase of his lion; on to vet bills; and then to other events that caused the line to rise as the expenses mounted. This tale had a tragic ending in that Dante was attacked by his lion and died. The line surged up past $20,000 because of expenses. When the life insurance payment came in and the lion was sold, the experience had cost Dante his life and $10,000.",,
32,Uncertainty and Complexity in Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
33,Uncertainty and Complexity in Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Dante used mathematics to critically consider a fictionalized experience. He was not simply completing an assignment: he was creating a narrative. Dante was an artist, a doodler; he was not interested in following procedures. The uncertainty in this project and in the classroom opened a door for him to bring his art and his humor into mathematicsor perhaps vice versa. In exploring the complex relationship between time and money, Dante realized that his fictionalizedproblem was far from linear. He critically challenged the assumptions that we, as a class, held about how a line could be used in math class to tell a story. He no longer saw math as a series of steps and procedures to follow, but as a way to think about and write about the world.",,
34,Uncertainty and Complexity in Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,IMPLICATIONS OF INCLUDING UNCERTAINTY IN THE CLASSROOM,,
35,Uncertainty and Complexity in Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"To make modeling central in the classroom, we placed students at the center. We asked them to view themselves as creators and critics of knowledge rather than as readers and absorbers of information, and to consider the perspective of an audience. We framed mathematical knowledge as fallible, corrigible, tentative and evolving as is every other kind of human knowledge (Hersh 1985, p. 21). We believe that building from student knowledge and student responses to tasks is the first step to creating a productive sense of uncertainty in the classroom.",,
36,Uncertainty and Complexity in Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"One approach to building on student knowledge is to provide an open task, elicit multiple responses, and consider how each might serve a particular purpose. An entry point to this type of task would be Dan Meyers graphing stories (http://graphingstories.com/). Students watch a graphing story (a video) of an event (someone climbing a ladder), then they represent the story with a graph. There are many possible right ways to model or represent these stories.",,
37,Uncertainty and Complexity in Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In discussing various graphs produced from video clips, students could justify why they made particular decisions in their models. What abstractions and approximations were used? What scale was chosen and why? How were the axes labeled? This is just one way to open up mathematics to multiple right answers.",,
38,Uncertainty and Complexity in Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Another simple way to invite uncertainty into our classrooms is in our response to students. Could we consider a students wrong answer and wonder what learning might lie within it? Perhaps, just a few seconds pause after a student response, and the internal question, How can this response contribute to our communitys learning? before responding would allow teachers to invite more students to envision themselves as mathematicians. Or the teacher can simply ask the student to elaborate and explain what he or she is thinking.",,
39,Uncertainty and Complexity in Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Perhaps a change in the assignments that we give and the way that we evaluate and give feedback to students could allow uncertainty. What might happen if we added a performance assessment or a rubric (see fig. 8)? How might either of those invite students to understand mathematics differently and to begin to see themselves as mathematicians? Could we ask a question about an incorrect answer rather than just marking it wrong? We believe that a stance of uncertainty can open doors to students who are underrepresented in mathematics, who have received too many tests showing that they have failed. It is possible to create a place in classrooms that is free from right and wrong and that instead asks students to think deeply about their choices and justify their decisions. When students are creators and critics of knowledge, the classroom can become less about being right and more about building understanding. Lesh and Yoon ask,",,
40,Uncertainty and Complexity in Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
41,Uncertainty and Complexity in Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"How can people be identified whose exceptional abilities do not fit the narrow and shallow band of abilities emphasized on existing textbooks and standardized tests? . . . when care has been taken to assess a broader range of understandings and abilities than those emphasized in traditional textbooks and tests, a broader range of students naturally emerged as having extraordinary potential. Furthermore, because such abilities were previously unrecognized, many of these students came from populations that are highly under represented in fields that emphasize mathematics, science, and technology. (2007, p. 161)",,
42,Uncertainty and Complexity in Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Uncertainty disrupts the conventional idea that there is one prescribed right way to do math or be a mathematician. As we are increasingly faced with data from high- stakes tests that we could read as an indication that some students are incapable of learning mathematics, we can push ourselves to be decidedly uncertain and invite all students into mathematics with open tasks, even as late as eighth grade. In doing so, we change the opportunities that they might have later on. Something as simple as asking a question rather than correcting a mistake might make the difference for a student and his or her future with mathematics.",,
