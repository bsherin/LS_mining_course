The routines are quick, are adaptable to a wide variety of concepts and grade levels, and are accessible to all students. The routines also incorporate both writing and discussion components to allow students to demonstrate the logical development of their thinking strategies and to help the teacher understand student ",6,Window on Resources - August 2014

The rest of the chapter explains how it can be implemented at a variety of grade levels and in a variety of ways. The authors explain how to differentiate and extend the routines throughout the school year to increase the development of number sense and the ability to discuss mathematics in a coherent manner using the correct vocabulary. The routines can all be used for a variety of content areas. The “Alike and Different” routine asks students to compare two or more numbers, properties, shapes, formulas, or any other concept using lists or Venn diagrams. The comparisons help students see relationships between the concepts and develop sequential thinking. The comparisons are also discussed to demonstrate the variety of thought strategies.",9,Window on Resources - August 2014

26,Window on Resources - August 2014,"Have you ever noticed how socially acceptable it seems to be for someone to say they are “bad” at math? The author of this book took note and wrote the book to focus on why accepting the belief that someone can be successful in life, without using math, is not a good thing. In fact, he proves that attaining success without math is unlikely. This book consists of nine themed chapters that focus on specific ways that math is used outside the classroom. The topics range from economics to the environment. Useful and insightful real-world connections to mathematics are found on every page. ",26,Window on Resources - August 2014
27,Window on Resources - August 2014,"Although this book provides many  applications of the concepts that students learn in school, the author is very clear in stating that his intended audience are the people who claim to be bad at mathematics. He writes to them, not to educators or students. However, the basic ideas within the book are applicable to any audience. Jeffrey Bennett highlights issues in education and in society at large, but he also offers suggestions and possible solutions in hopes of changing the view of mathematics.

The problems are designed to take five  to ten minutes of class time, but the tasks could be extended or shortened depending on need. Many problems include a short explanation before introducing a high cognitive demand question. Some problems contain little rote calculation, but instead provide interesting starting points for further mathematical discussion, such as the Sierpinski triangle and the Riddle of St. Ives.
