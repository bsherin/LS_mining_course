0,Using iPads to Your Advantage - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"There are increased calls to incorporate technology into classrooms, which have led to the adoption of the iPad in many classrooms around the country. This tablet computer is often chosen as the medium for technology integration because it is user-friendly, lightweight, and wireless. It also allows access to inexpensive applications. Although iPads may be considered expensive, they afford access to online textbooks that can be updated annually, thereby reducing costs over time.",,
1,Using iPads to Your Advantage - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Although educators recognize the importance of technology in the classroom, they encounter difficulties as they attempt to stay current with technological advances. Consequently, the affordances of technology are lost in many Kgrade 12 classrooms in the United States (Ottenbreit-Leftwich et al. 2012). U.S. teachers report a lack of technological skills when it comes to implementing technology in the classroom (Chapman, Masters, and Pedulla 2010). Therefore, technology integration is still surprisingly low even when professional development is available and technological infrastructures are in place.",,
2,Using iPads to Your Advantage - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Many teachers complain that they lack professional development to implement technology appropriately, or they are required to attend training that is beyond their ability level (Blow and McConnell 2012). Teacher beliefs also play a role in classroom technology integration (Hutchinson 2012). Teachers in student-centered classrooms, according to Ertmer and Ottenbreit-Leftwich (2013), have a more positive attitude toward technology than those in traditionally structured classrooms. Teachers also worry that after they introduce the iPad, students will become engrossed with the tablet itself and lose focus on instruction (Blow and McConnell 2012). Many teachers have found, however, that iPads enhance engagement and teamwork, especially in the middle grades (Downes and Bishop 2012). Therefore, because of the increase of students who are digital natives, those who have grown up with technology, and the push toward technology, many teachers wish to enhance their instruction using iPads.",,

4,Using iPads to Your Advantage - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Sharing work is imperative in education. The relatively small iPad screen makes such sharing difficult. However, sharing documents from a computer connected to a projector can offset this problem. iPads are enticing because they save time in the classroom through the use of educational apps and ease of access to the Internet.",,
5,Using iPads to Your Advantage - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Several software programs and devices are now available that will allow the iPad screen to be projected for whole-class viewing. These programs and devices include Doceri, Spashtop, and Apple TV. Although each method has positive and negative aspects, they all allow iPad screens to be projected so that fluid transitions and rapid sharing can occur.",,
6,Using iPads to Your Advantage - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Doceri, a software program, runs simultaneously on a computer and an iPad. When the programs are run simultaneously, the wireless connection allows the iPad screen to be projected. Splashtop is similar to Doceri, but it also allows for wireless access to the desktop of a computer. This additional feature permits teachers to access content on their desktop directly from the iPad as they circulate around the room. One disadvantage of Doceri and Splashtop is that both programs require that their software be downloaded on a computer so that the iPad will work properly.",,
7,Using iPads to Your Advantage - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Apple TV is another screen projection option. Apple TV is a small device that connects wirelessly to the Internet and an iPad. iPads have an internal device, which will connect to the Apple TV without additional software. Also, Apple TV includes a password protection option so that students cannot project their screens without permission. In addition to projecting iPad screens, Apple TV allows access to computers and content associated with any Apple ID.",,
8,Using iPads to Your Advantage - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,USING PROJECTED IPADS IN THE MATHEMATICS CLASSROOM,,
9,Using iPads to Your Advantage - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Although many apps are available for classroom use and instruction, my experience as a middle school teacher has shown that most are not useful for inquiry-based learning in mathematics. Many math apps focus on drill, which can help students practice basic skills, but few develop critical-thinking or problem-solving skills. However, iPads can be used as a conduit to conduct mathematics investigations and gather mathematical information (Attard and Northcote 2012). Therefore, I have worked over the past two years to determine effective methods of using the iPad in the mathematics classroom.",,
10,Using iPads to Your Advantage - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"During the 20122013 school year, our school supplied teachers and students with iPads, which caused a steep learning curve. Teachers began to learn how to incorporate this technology into the classroom to aid instruction. Students learned how to use iPads for educational purposes, such as homework completion and note taking. Consequently, students enjoyed using the iPads and became more engaged when lessons involved the tablet.",,
11,Using iPads to Your Advantage - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"As a mathematics teacher, this sparked my own curiosity in terms of using this tablet to the advantage of my students and myself. During training, I learned about Doceri and Splashtop but found the trial versions would not run effectively on my computer. After doing some research, I discovered that Apple TV allows screen projection, so I purchased one for my classroom.",,
12,Using iPads to Your Advantage - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I felt the Apple TV would be an effective method of sharing group solutions, so I developed a set of rules for screen sharing. Students understood that if they projected their screen without permission, the privilege would be revoked for the entire class. Once students were shown how to project their screens and understood the rules for screen projection through the Apple TV, we began to use it regularly.",,
13,Using iPads to Your Advantage - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,IPADS IN ACTION,,
14,Using iPads to Your Advantage - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"As I began a unit on multiplying and dividing fractions, I chose to start with the Mangoes problem (see fig. 1) from NCTMs Illuminations website. Throughout the evening, a King, a Queen, and two Princes eat various fractional amounts of the mangoes from a bowl in the kitchen. Students were asked to use the fractions presented to determine the original number of mangoes.",,
15,Using iPads to Your Advantage - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
16,Using iPads to Your Advantage - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"After I presented this problem to my students, many were immediately confused. However, I urged them to discuss the problem in their groups. They then discovered clues within the problem, leading to more questions and further debate about how to tackle the problem. Students grappled with the concepts of fractions and being given the solution rather than the starting point. However, as students continued to talk, they began to develop various methods of solutions. Although it was necessary to probe the thoughts of some groups, the students were engaged with the activity at hand. By the end of the period, many students had begun to understand how to solve the problem.",,
17,Using iPads to Your Advantage - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The following day, the students worked on the Mangoes problem again. Groups formed solutions and gave reasons for their method of solution. They worked together to display their work on their iPads to share with the class. Each group was eager to project their solution. Throughout the period, each group had an opportunity to display their work and explain their solution. Groups worked together to answer questions from their peers about their solution. At the conclusion of the period, students were engaged in discussion and debate.",,
18,Using iPads to Your Advantage - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Later, when I asked students if they enjoyed the activity, they unanimously said yes. I probed further, asking what it was they enjoyed most. Some said the challenge of the problem, whereas others expressed thoughtfulness about all the solutions. Others said that they enjoyed working with a team toward a common goal. All students agreed that they enjoyed the presentations. One student stated that she felt safe presenting work from her seat because she had the support of her team. Another student said he felt less time was wasted and there was more time for debate and discussion. Overall, I found students to be more engaged in mathematics than I had seen in a long time. The combination of technology and truly challenging mathematics allowed my students to excel in ways they never imagined. In the process, they learned to work as a team.",,
19,Using iPads to Your Advantage - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,BI: BEFORE IPADS,,
20,Using iPads to Your Advantage - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Before incorporating the iPad into instruction, groups would complete their assignment on paper or on mini whiteboards. They would then need to transfer their work to the classroom whiteboard to present their solution to the class. This time-consuming task required group transition time, which wasted precious minutes of instruction. Although students enjoyed putting their work on the board, they would often explain their solution quickly and return to their seats.",,
21,Using iPads to Your Advantage - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Since I have introduced the iPad into the classroom, thus reducing the transition time and increasing discussion, this process has changed. As groups complete their assignments, I ask them to find a way to display their solutions on an iPad. When all the groups have finished, I have each group present its solution. Students not only take time to thoroughly explain their solutions but also ask classmates if they have questions and attempt to answer any queries before they remove their iPad screen from the projector.",,
22,Using iPads to Your Advantage - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"This method has become an enormous time saver because students are ready to project their work and do not need to leave their seats. Additionally, students enjoy presenting their solutions on the iPad and work diligently to complete their work so that they may prepare their presentation for their iPad. Consequently, because students enjoy projecting their screen, their solution descriptions have become much more thorough, and the students are more eager to answer questions that their classmates may have while they are presenting their screen.",,
23,Using iPads to Your Advantage - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,One large benefit of this use of technology is that students are able to spend more time discussing mathematics rather than waiting for solutions to be rewritten and presented.,,
