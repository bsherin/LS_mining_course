"Ryan C. Pescosolido, and Jere Confrey cChildren learn from a very early age  what it means to get their “fair share.” Whether it is candy or birthday cake, many children successfully create equal-size groups or parts of a collection or whole but later struggle to create fair shares of multiple wholes, such as fairly sharing four pies among a family of seven. Recent research suggests that engaging and supporting students in fair-sharing tasks are meaningful contexts that can be used to strengthen their rational number ",2,mtms2011-11-230a,,

It is well documented that even in middle school students continue to struggle with concepts of rational numbers (Lamon 2007). In particular, many students do not recognize the equivalence of the operation a ÷ b and the quantity a/b. Although students may attain computational fl uency with rational numbers, many continue to have conceptual diffi culties (Lamon 2007).",3,mtms2011-11-230a,,
"NCTM’s Principles and Standards  for School Mathematics (2000)  emphasizes the importance of understanding multiplicative relationships, fractions, and ratio to build a strong foundation for rational number reasoning throughout the middle grades. In particular, the Curriculum Focal Points for Prekindergarten through Grade 8 Mathematics (NCTM 2006) places a heavy emphasis in sixth grade and seventh grade on developing understandings of ratios, rates, and proportionality, and using rational numbers with the arithmetic operations. These concepts of rational number reasoning are imperative for success in algebra as well as in more advanced mathematics and science courses (Post et al. 1993). This article presents fair-sharing activities, student work samples, and instructional ideas that can help middle grades students strengthen their rational number reasoning.  a looK at eQUiPaRtitioning",4,mtms2011-11-230a,,
"In a recent review of research on rational number reasoning, Confrey noticed similarities occurring among some research studies involving fair sharing. Of interest were elementary grades students’ work with collections and single wholes and middle grades students’ work with multiple wholes. On the basis of her prior work on splitting, Confrey conjectured that children exhibit understanding and proficiency in producing equalsize groups and parts far earlier than previously acknowledged.

"and colleagues (2009) proposed that equipartitioning was the underlying cognitive action unifying these research studies. Equipartitioning is defined as cognitive behaviors that have the goal of producing equal-size groups or equal-size parts, such as is typically encountered by children when constructing “fair shares” for each individual in a group.

"They also distinguished equipartitioning from breaking, in which there is no requirement for parts to be equal to one another. With instructional attention, they suggest that developing equipartitioning through fair sharing  table 1 These equipartitioning cases explore n objects shared among p people.",8,mtms2011-11-230a,,
"may lead to an understanding of rational numbers as a quantity (fraction), a ratio, and as an operation (multiplication, division, scaling). Equipartitioning tasks can be subdivided into three distinct cases, as shown in table 1. On the basis of this review and interviews with students, Confrey and colleagues have constructed an equipartitioning learning trajectory (EPLT) (Confrey et al. 2009). Learning trajectories are descriptions of levels of increasingly sophisticated reasoning through which students are likely to progress as they develop deeper understandings of concepts. Although it is not anticipated that every child will pass through every level, learning trajectories serve as a way to monitor students’ progress and anticipate next steps for instruction.",9,mtms2011-11-230a,,
"The EPLT describes how students’  notions of fair sharing develop over time to an understanding of partitive division, beginning with experiences of fairly sharing collections of objects and single wholes. As students gain competence with these tasks, they learn mathematical reasoning practices, like naming, and develop understandings of relationships that later influence the ways that they fairly share multiple wholes. The trajectory describes how these strategies, practices, and relationships unify as a generalization of partitive division, a divided into b parts, relating ratio reasoning with fractions.

"A key idea of learning trajectories is that students bring prior understandings. Many young students are successful in fairly sharing snacks and game pieces and in other situations in which they must allocate collections of items into equal-size groups (Wilson et al. forthcoming). Many use dealing out as a way to establish fair shares rather than counting and using arithmetic operations. For these students, the action of dealing out creates a one-to-one correspondence that ensures the equivalence of groups. These young students name the results of sharing not only as a count but also in ways that relate the size of a share to the original collection. Reflecting on the results of sharing provides early experiences in developing notions of a rational number as a ratio, operator, and quantity. For instance, sharing 15 candies among 3 friends may be referred to as “5 candies per person,” “one-third of the candy,” or “one-third.”",21,mtms2011-11-230a,,
"Students also bring experiences in sharing single wholes, such as cutting sandwiches or pizzas, and recognize when shares are not equivalent or if there are leftover amounts. Many students are able to successfully share a single whole for 2, 4, or even 8 people early in their understanding; however, sharing for odd numbers of people is more difficult for them. Similar to naming when sharing collections, describing one person’s share after equipartitioning a whole among 6 people ",22,mtms2011-11-230a,,

"Students’ experiences sharing collections and single wholes provide a foundation on which more complex sharing activities involving multiple wholes can be built. To facilitate a discussion of strategies and naming when sharing multiple wholes, consider the following tasks and strategies.",25,mtms2011-11-230a,,
Task 1: “How Could You Share 4 Pizzas Fairly among 6 People?”,26,mtms2011-11-230a,,
"Students can use a variety of strategies to solve this type of problem, as illustrated in table 2. One common strategy is split-all, in which students view the task as multiple instances of sharing a single whole. When sharing 4 pizzas among 6 people, they cut each of the 4 pizzas into sixths and deal 1 piece of each pizza to each person (see table 2, row 1). This method results in equal-size shares; each person receives 4 pieces of size 1/6 of a single pizza. ",27,mtms2011-11-230a,,
"Sometimes students who have not invented the split-all strategy are unable to anticipate how to split a whole for a given number of people. In such a situation, a student’s inability to share a single whole or to recognize its relevance to sharing multiple wholes can inhibit success. To overcome this obstacle, students may apply a benchmarking strategy; that is, they use their knowledge of benchmark fractions to split each whole and deal those parts. This strategy effectively reduces the task into a collection for dealing out, potentially with leftover parts. For task 1, after splitting the 4 pizzas in halves and dealing out, the student would have 2 halves left over. At this point, some students use  table 2 When considering task 1, which involves sharing 4 pizzas among 6 people, students need to keep in mind that they are considering 1/6 of the total amount of pizza.",28,mtms2011-11-230a,,

Split-all,30,mtms2011-11-230a,,
"Benchmarking a benchmark strategy again, whereas others may resort to more primitive, unsuccessful strategies for sharing a single whole, such as chopping or disregarding the remaining pizza (see table 2, row 2). ",31,mtms2011-11-230a,,
"Naming shares and the referent unit. The ways that students name shares are related to strategies they use; these share names provide rich opportunities for students to understand more fully a fundamental issue of rational number reasoning, which is units. The ability to correctly name the resulting share is more nuanced than it at first seems. A teacher may pose two questions to elicit different names: “How much of 1 pizza does each person get?” and “How much of the total pizza does each person get?” The slight  difference in these questions draws attention to the referent unit being used. In the first question, how much of 1 pizza indicates that the student should consider a single pizza as the unit and describe the share in relation to 1 pizza. The second question involves a different referent unit—the total pizza. Instead of using 1 pizza as a unit, the student must now describe the size of one person’s share in relation to the entire original amount of pizza (four pizzas). ",32,mtms2011-11-230a,,
"Suppose a student solved task 1 using a split-all strategy that results in 24 pieces of pizza. By considering a single pizza as a unit, one share would be 4 pieces of size 1/6, and each person’s share would be described as 4 one-sixths (four-sixths) of 1 pizza. However, if a student  table 3 When considering task 2, which involves sharing 7 pizzas among 3 people, students must consider 1/3 of the total amount of pizza.",33,mtms2011-11-230a,,
"strategy and Representation name (1 Pizza as Referent Unit) views all 4 pizzas as the unit, each person gets 1/6 of the total pizza. Teachers can discuss each of these names with students to emphasize their equivalence.",34,mtms2011-11-230a,,
"Another subset of tasks for sharing  multiple wholes produces equal-size parts greater than 1 whole. Students may use the split-all and benchmarking strategies to solve these tasks or use another strategy related to their prior experiences with sharing collections. To illustrate, consider task 2 and its related strategies.",35,mtms2011-11-230a,,
Task 2: “How Could You Share  7 Pizzas Fairly among 3 People?”,36,mtms2011-11-230a,,
"Similar to task 1, a common strategy for students is split-all; for task 2, each pizza would be equipartitioned into thirds, making 21 thirds (see table 3, row 1). Then pieces would be dealt equally to the 3 people. Because splitting a circle into thirds is difficult, some students use a benchmarking strategy (shown in table 3, row 2) by splitting—  1/3 +  + 1/3, 7 one-thirds pieces, 7/3 pizzas 4/2 + 1/4 + 1/12 pizza 1 + 1 + 1/3 pizzas, 2 1/3 pizzas",37,mtms2011-11-230a,,

"With this strategy, one can see the influences of prior experiences of dealing out collections to establish the equivalence of shares.",41,mtms2011-11-230a,,
"Another strategy for multiple  wholes, deal-then-split (see table 3, row 3), is unique to tasks yielding equal-size parts greater than 1 whole. Students deal all the wholes that can be dealt fairly and then split the left- over wholes fairly, effectively transforming the task into a combination of sharing a collection and single  wholes or a simpler version of sharing multiple wholes. Using this strategy for task 2, students would first deal  2 whole pizzas to each person, leaving 1 pizza remaining. Students then share the remaining pizza by splitting it into thirds or using a benchmark strategy.",42,mtms2011-11-230a,,
"Naming shares and improper and  mixed fractions. Similar issues are involved in naming a share, depending on the referent unit for task 2. By using the split-all strategy, a student may recognize that each person gets 1/3 of each pizza, or 7 pieces of size 1/3, which is a total of 7/3 pizzas. The benchmarking strategy would result in a share of 4 halves, 1 quarter, and 1 twelfth. With the deal-then-split strategy, a student may name the share as 2 whole pizzas and 1/3 of a pizza, or the mixed number 2 1/3 pizzas. Although the strategy used for sharing affects the ways that students name the resulting share, the distinction of the referent unit also affects the ways that students describe shares. If a student views the referent unit as the total pizza for task 2, 3 people sharing produces 1/3 of the total pizza. With a referent unit of  1 pizza, a share would be 7/3 of  1 pizza, or 2 1/3 pizzas. Related instruction should help students generalize that equipartitioning multiple wholes results in a share of 1/pth of the total, or m/pths of 1 whole. Comparing and reflecting on the two names that use the same referent unit can be a means for discussing the equivalence of improper and mixed fractions (see table 2 and table 3).",43,mtms2011-11-230a,,

These emergent relationships are tools that are developed and refined as students experience equipartitioning, and they stand in contrast to directly providing formalized properties for students to apply.",48,mtms2011-11-230a,,
"Some students may use their developing understandings of ratio when solving these tasks. This approach, called coordinated splitting (Confrey et al. 2009), leads to two developments:  1. It cognitively reduces the demands  of the problem; and  2. It introduces students to the concept of co-variation, the idea of a relationship between two varying quantities. ",49,mtms2011-11-230a,,
"As students recognize that they can create subsets of both the number of wholes shared and the number of shares created, they develop the ability to coordinate variations in both the number of shares and the amount shared with their understanding of naming a share as a ratio. ",50,mtms2011-11-230a,,
"In task 1, co-variation refers to  coordinating between the number of  pizzas and sharers while keeping the share invariant. Students may reason that they can create two equal subsets of pizzas and people, reducing the task to sharing 2 pizzas among 3 people, as shown in figure 1. Students may also realize that 4 pizzas shared among  6 people is equivalent to 6 pizzas shared among 9 people. These realizations lead to the generalization that as the number of pizzas increases by 2, the number of sharers must increase by 3. With support, students may go further and understand the unit ratio for task 1 is 2/3 pizza per 1 person. That is, to maintain the fair share, each additional person sharing must receive 2/3 of a pizza.  conclUsion",51,mtms2011-11-230a,,
"Although curricular materials may not provide many explicit opportunities for understanding division as sharing multiple wholes, existing tasks can be adjusted easily to provide students with these experiences. Teachers may adapt the tasks presented in this article by varying the number of pizzas, people sharing, or context to explore issues of naming, referent units, and co-variation. Another idea is to use a fair-sharing context with deal-thensplit. This strategy will help ground an approach that uses partial quotients, which students learned when developing algorithms for division, as described in figure 2.",52,mtms2011-11-230a,,
