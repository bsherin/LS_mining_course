By integrating such activities within existing curricula, students better appreciate how their school learning in mathematics and science applies to problems in the outside world. Furthermore, modeling problems are open to multiple approaches and solutions; thus, they encourage the creative, critical, and flexible thinking that is often lacking in more traditional textbook examples.",,
1,Bridging STEM in a Real-World Problem - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"For many years, we have been working with classroom teachers to create modeling problems involving a detailed analysis of comprehensive data sets (e.g., English and Mousoulides 2011). As they go about their daily lives, our students are faced with increasingly complex, powerful, and dynamic systems of information. Just searching the Internet exposes them to comprehensive data sources, some of which are contradictory and potentially unreliable. Careful reading and critical attention are needed if these sources are to be used wisely.",,

Our engineering problems, which are examples of model-eliciting activities (Lesh and Zawojewski 2007), are  realistic, client-driven, multifaceted, and idea generators. That is, the core ideas are not presented up front but are embedded within the problem and must be elicited and operated on to produce a solution model.",,
5,Bridging STEM in a Real-World Problem - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"By constructing our engineering-based problems as model-eliciting activities, we can promote design processes that apply across STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) domains.

In the present case, sixth-grade mathematics and science teachers worked with the bridge design activity and conducted it in two of their classes (with twelve-year-old students) across three sessions. The activity (adapted from Guzey, Moore, and Roehrig 2010) focused on the 2007 structural failure of the  35W Bridge in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in which 13 people died and  145 were injured.",,
19,Bridging STEM in a Real-World Problem - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The activity required students to develop a model for (a) calculating  the cost for each one of the four  bridge types (see table 1), and then  (b) selecting the best possible bridge type for the reconstruction of the collapsed bridge. All possible factors related to bridge type, materials used, design, safety, and cost were to be considered.",,
20,Bridging STEM in a Real-World Problem - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In session 1 (3545 minutes), we introduced the problem context with an introductory activity comprising  (a) a newspaper article about the  35W Bridge collapse and (b) a video clip of the collapse (www.youtube .com/watch?v=C31IlOHNzbM). A second article presented the main characteristics of the four types of bridges. Next, the students studied the articles and the video and answered questions individually about the articles to ensure that they understood the core ideas, such as the factors believed to be involved in the collapse. Excerpts of the articles and the readiness questions appear in figure 2.",,

22,Bridging STEM in a Real-World Problem - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In session 2 (8090 minutes), the students studied the problem scenario (see fig. 3) while working in mixed-ability groups of three or four. Each group of students was expected to deliver one model, or more, for solving the given problem, reflecting the ideas and work of all students. Two tables of quantitative and qualitative data accompanied the problem text (see tables 1 and 2), together with examples of the main bridge types. The students then worked on generating, refining, and documenting their models. The students had to draw on the given data in (a) developing a model for calculating the cost for each bridge type, and (b) using the cost model in conjunction with other bridge characteristics (e.g., safety, materials, design) in proposing the best possible bridge type for the reconstruction of the collapsed bridge in Minnesota  (see fig. 2).",,

28,Bridging STEM in a Real-World Problem - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Although a few student groups remained bogged down in the data and were unable to produce an appropriate model, the majority were able to do so with varying levels of sophistication. The models varied in the number of problem factors students used (cost per surface unit of bridge deck, aesthetics of the different bridge types, design effort, difficulty level of construction, and length), and in the different approaches to dealing with these factors. For example, some groups did not rank the different bridge types but only provided paired comparisons between the types, whereas other groups developed quite sophisticated procedures for ranking the different bridge types according to their cost.",,

30,Bridging STEM in a Real-World Problem - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"One group that produced a model focusing only on mathematical factors decided that a cable-stayed bridge would be the most appropriate to build. The students based their decision on the swiftness with which this type of bridge could be constructed. They maintained from the outset that this bridge type was the most effective. Considerable debate ensued, however, as to whether the cable-stayed bridge was a better option than the suspension bridge. Some students commented that the latter was too expensive, so the group decided to develop a cost model for each type of bridge to base their selection on more criteria than only qualitative information. Their deliberations included these comments:",,
31,Bridging STEM in a Real-World Problem - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Student 1: A cable-stayed bridge is the best choice. . . . It can be built fast, it is a beautiful one, and it is not very expensive, like the suspension one.",,
32,Bridging STEM in a Real-World Problem - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Student 2: The suspension has the same characteristics. . . . It is not more expensive . . . well, it is difficult to conclude if we continue to work like this.",,
33,Bridging STEM in a Real-World Problem - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Student 1: OK. First things first. We cannot compare as they are . . . they are not the same [refers to bridges length].,,
34,Bridging STEM in a Real-World Problem - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Initially, this group developed a simple division model by dividing cost (at present value) by the total length of each bridge and then calculating the average cost per foot for each bridge type. The interactions within the group helped the students realize that the width of each bridge given in the data was not the same:",,
35,Bridging STEM in a Real-World Problem - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Student 3: Something is wrong; this is not reasonable.,,
36,Bridging STEM in a Real-World Problem - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Student 2: Why not? How do you know it is not correct?,,
37,Bridging STEM in a Real-World Problem - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Student 3: Well, we took into account the length, but there are big bridges with many lanes and also small ones for pedestrians. . . . This is my concern.",,
38,Bridging STEM in a Real-World Problem - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Student 1: Exactly, we need to use length and number of lanes.",,
39,Bridging STEM in a Real-World Problem - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The students then moved into a second developmental cycle, creating a model for the cost based on using both the length and the width of bridge deck (cost per square foot). However, this was not a straightforward process. The students faced difficulties calculating the width of the different bridges because the given data referred to car lanes. After some assistance in determining that the typical width of a lane was 12 feet,  the group used this figure to further improve its model, as shown in  figure 4. The group also made an estimation of the width of bike and pedestrian bridges by using a fixed width (30 ft.) in their model.",,
40,Bridging STEM in a Real-World Problem - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
41,Bridging STEM in a Real-World Problem - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"On the basis of their results, the students confirmed that the best  possible type was the cable-stayed bridge. They further supported their decision by emphasizing that this bridge type was the least expensive, according to their results. However, they did not question the great variation in their results, especially the large differences between bridges within the same type. In the next example, the student group did take into account this  variation.",,

43,Bridging STEM in a Real-World Problem - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"One of the most sophisticated models was developed by a group that took into consideration mathematical, engineering, and societal factors. The group commenced the problem by excluding a truss-type bridge.",,
44,Bridging STEM in a Real-World Problem - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Student 1: The collapsed bridge was a truss one . . . it is here [points to a frame of the provided video].,,
45,Bridging STEM in a Real-World Problem - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Student 3: We should not choose this one [refers to the bridge type].,,
46,Bridging STEM in a Real-World Problem - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Student 4: Selecting the truss type bridge would make people feel insecure and bring back all those bad memories.,,
47,Bridging STEM in a Real-World Problem - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The students decided that a cost model for ranking the different bridge types was needed, but their subsequent reasoning was more refined than the previous groups calculations.",,
48,Bridging STEM in a Real-World Problem - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Although they initially developed a model similar to the previous groups example, the students realized that calculating the average cost (cost per square foot of deck) for each bridge type was not the best possible solution. They concluded that the great variation in their results for bridges of the same type (two examples per bridge type were provided) could be corrected by integrating more factors within their model.",,
49,Bridging STEM in a Real-World Problem - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Student 3: Our calculations are correct. There is nothing wrong. The cost is very different.,,
50,Bridging STEM in a Real-World Problem - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Student 2: There are other things [factors] that are important and influence the cost. . . . For those [bridges] that are close to sea it is more difficult.,,
51,Bridging STEM in a Real-World Problem - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Student 3: Yes, like in the Golden Gate Bridge. It is so expensive and it is not that long.",,
52,Bridging STEM in a Real-World Problem - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Student 1: Cost is not proportionally related to the surface of the bridge [deck], but also the level of difficulty in constructability, just like in the Golden Gate, is an important factor.",,
53,Bridging STEM in a Real-World Problem - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"After using the data provided in table 1, however, the group concluded that all bridge types had their advantages and disadvantages; therefore, the students could not determine a recommended bridge type from the first table. The group then entered its next cycle of model development by taking into account other factors. The discussion on calculating the cost model also contributed to a refinement in their perceptions of the engineering and societal factors that should be integrated in their model.",,
54,Bridging STEM in a Real-World Problem - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"These factors included the necessary extra lanes for bridges, bikes, and pedestrians, as well as the difficulty level of each bridge construction, as shown in figure 5. The last factor was determined by dividing the final cost estimate by 1.5 for the bridges listed. This 1.5 was identified as a difficult constructability factor. The group specifically created this approach (dividing by 1.5) to provide the same basis of comparison for all bridge types. The groups model presented a ranking of cable-stayed, arch, truss, and suspension bridges. However, the students finally selected the arch type as the best possible solution because they were still concerned about the stability of a cable-stayed type for long span bridges (as indicated in table 1).",,

57,Bridging STEM in a Real-World Problem - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The decision making used in solving complex problems is not an easy or straightforward process, which the students realized in this activity. Some frustration occurred at the start, especially for groups of students with limited interactions. However, as the activity progressed, more and more students got actively involved and highly appreciated their developments along the way. Working in mixed-ability groups provided a safe environment for students to express their ideas.",,
58,Bridging STEM in a Real-World Problem - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"For the teachers, the inclusion of both individual work (session 1) and mixed-group work in the remaining sessions enabled useful insights into students thinking. As one student commented, I really enjoyed the activity. It was great. I was frustrated at the beginning and did not like  it, but then we gradually realized what we had to do. . . . It was so pleasant that we discovered this on our own. . . . I really liked using maths in solving such a difficult problem.",,
59,Bridging STEM in a Real-World Problem - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The activity helped students appreciate the nature of problem solving beyond the classroom. Dealing effectively with problems in daily life often necessitates combining many factors, some of which may be ambiguous and conflicting. Frequently, multiple objectives need to be satisfied, complex data need to be analyzed carefully, and more than one acceptable solution must be considered.
