"Elementary and middle school reform mathematics curricula introduce geometric transformations at different grade levels. In middle school, students delve deeper into the properties of translations, reflections, and rotations. The authors of reform curricula, as well as NCTM, encourage students to use technology to explore transformations. NCTM’s Principles and Standards for School Mathematics states that “transformational geometry offers another lens through which to investigate and interpret geometric objects. To help them form images of shapes through different transformations, students can use physical objects, figures traced on tissue paper, mirrors or other reflective surfaces, figures drawn on graph paper, and dynamic geometry software” (NCTM 2000, p. 235).",3,mtms2013-03-444a,,

We encountered this situation while visiting an eighthgrade classroom and opted for using handheld technology, specifically calculators, instead. ",6,mtms2013-03-444a,,
"McGehee and Griffith (2004,  p. 344) write that “hand-held programmable devices provide affordable access to electronic tools that allow students to use multiple representations to explore mathematical situations.” The students had been working  on transformations for one class period when we visited. We wanted the students to experience transformations with technology and to “think about transformations as being something other than the path taken by a shape” (Glass 2004, p. 397).",7,mtms2013-03-444a,,

"Transformations (Lappan et al. 2002). We decided to enhance this unit by introducing the TI-73 Explorer™ into this classroom. All students were familiar with graphing calculators, but they had yet to use the Geoboard App on the TI-73.",10,mtms2013-03-444a,,

"Three activities were completed in class, with time for discussion and exploration. The students had used TI-83s in the past and needed little time to familiarize themselves with the TI-73 and the Geoboard App. The application had been preloaded onto each classsroom TI-73. The Geoboard App can be downloaded from http://education.ti.com; search for “geoboard.”",12,mtms2013-03-444a,,
"Since we had three instructors in  the classroom, we positioned ourselves such that one instructor demonstrated using the overhead projector while the other two instructors walked around assisting students. After students were familiar with the application, they were ready to use the TI-73 to reflect, rotate, and translate simple shapes. Students worked in small groups at their tables.",13,mtms2013-03-444a,,
activity 1: Reflections,14,mtms2013-03-444a,,
"Each student was given a copy of  activity sheet 1. Students reflected a triangle across different mirror lines and explored the abilities and limitations of the TI-73 Geoboard App. After students were comfortable using the application, we gave them time to explore reflections by asking: •	 Can	the	mirror	line	be	a	diagonal	 line? Why, or why not?  •	 Are	the	pre-image	and	image	  congruent?  •	 Does	everyone	know	what	  congruent means?  •	 Do	the	pre-image	and	image	have	 the same area and/or the same perimeter? a Brief explanation  of transformations one definition of a transformation is that it is a one-to-one correspondence  between points in a plane, such that each point P is associated with a unique point P′ (Long and DeTemple 2000). Essentially, this means that some shape on a plane “moves”: The set of points that comprises the shape before it moves is called the pre-image (each point P in the definition above), and the set of points that comprises the shape after it moves is called the image of P (or each point P′).",15,mtms2013-03-444a,,
"For this activity, we concentrated on the class of transformations called  isometries. an isometry is a transformation that preserves the size and shape of the geometric figure. For example, if a 3-4-5 right triangle is being transformed under an isometry, it will still be a 3-4-5 right triangle when finished (it will not get larger or smaller, and it will not change shape). all corresponding sides and corresponding angles will be congruent. Isometries also preserve parallelism; if two lines (rays, segments, and so on) were parallel before the transformation, they will be parallel after the transformation. Translations, rotations, and reflections—the three transformations in this activity—are all isometries.",16,mtms2013-03-444a,,
"Translations (also called slides) move an object a certain distance in a  certain direction. Each point on the object moves the exact same distance and angle. In our example, each student moved their object on the geoboard  3 spaces to the right and 2 spaces down, so that each point on the object moved 3 spaces to the right and 2 spaces down.",17,mtms2013-03-444a,,
"Rotations (also called turns) turn a geometric figure around a specified  point in the plane. Unlike our example using the technology, where the point of rotation had to be a vertex of the geometric figure, the point of rotation could be on, inside, or outside the figure. For example, the hands of an analog clock rotate around the center of the clock; in this case, the point of rotation (the center of the clock) is on the objects being rotated (the hands). also, the distance an object rotates can be any amount of degrees and not just restricted to certain amounts, as on a geoboard.",18,mtms2013-03-444a,,
"Reflections (also called flips) produce a “mirror image” of a figure through a line on the plane. This line can be called the line of reflection, mirror line, or reflecting line. a mirror image of a figure often does look as if the figure “flipped” across the reflecting line, although sometimes this is difficult to visually confirm if the line of reflection is not perfectly horizontal or vertical.",19,mtms2013-03-444a,,
"There is one other major type of transformation found in K-12 curricula  that is not an isometry. This transformation is known as a dilation, and it belongs to a class of transformations called similitudes. Under a similitude, a set of points maps from the pre-image to the image, but the mapping does not preserve size or shape; with dilations, size is not preserved. For example, under a certain dilation, a 3-4-5 right triangle could be transformed to a  6-8-10 right triangle. although a dilation does preserve shape (all corresponding angles will be congruent), it does not preserve size.",20,mtms2013-03-444a,,
"Glass (2004), who emphasizes the importance of thinking about transformations as something “other than the path taken by a shape,” notes that “one way that we could shift the emphasis is to ask students to develop and  justify general statements about the relationships between pre-images and images” (p. 397). We wanted students to use the calculators to answer these questions, and we believe that this could not have been done efficiently  themselves than they learned from a curriculum, textbook, or activity sheet. ",21,mtms2013-03-444a,,
"We believe that this activity is a good introduction or reinforcement to translations, reflections, and rotations and a good alternative to using computer software.",22,mtms2013-03-444a,,
