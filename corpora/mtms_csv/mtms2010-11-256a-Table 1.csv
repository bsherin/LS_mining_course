Chris mows lawns that are generally 100 feet × 50 feet. He is wondering how much exercise he gets from mowing a lawn and how much area he actually mows.,4,mtms2010-11-256a,,
"The lawn mower that Chris is  using cuts a swath of 21 inches. With overlapping, Chris figures that each subsequent pass is 20 inches wide. Assume that all the lawns in Chris’s neighborhood have the same shape and dimensions.",5,mtms2010-11-256a,,
"PRoBleMs 1.  Chris makes one pass, starting  from one corner and mowing along the shorter side to the opposite corner.  a.  What is the shape of the section of the grass that was cut in one pass?  3.  Chris has completed four passes.",6,mtms2010-11-256a,,
"a.  What is the area of the grass  now mowed?    b. How many feet has Chris walked?   b.  What is the area of this section   4.  What is the total area of a lawn  in feet? What is the area in inches? 2.  Chris makes two passes, down  one side and back. Consider the overlapping lawn that is mowed.  a.  What is the area of grass that  is cut in the two passes in feet?  What is the area in inches?   b.  How many feet has Chris  walked in these two passes?  How many inches has he  walked? in this neighborhood? How many 20-inch passes will Chris need to make to mow one lawn? How many feet will he walk?  5.  What width of lawn mower would  make the number of feet that Chris walks equal to the number of area units in the yard? eXtension",7,mtms2010-11-256a,,

"Teacher’s notes: This problem provides a valuable context for differentiating between units used to measure distance and area. To students, the distance that Chris walks may seem similar to the area that he mows. To correctly solve the problem, students will need to clearly identify what differentiates a unit of distance from a unit of area. Giving the measure of the width of the mower in inches and the length and width of the yard in feet can help students understand the difference between a square inch and a square foot.  1.  (a) The shape is a rectangle.  (b) Its area is either  21 × 600 = 12,600 sq. in.",11,mtms2010-11-256a,,
  or approximately  1 3/4 × 50 = 87 1/2 sq. ft.,12,mtms2010-11-256a,,
"  Discuss whether one is a better measure of the area mowed and why.  2.  (a) In feet, from question 1, the  first pass is 87 1/2 square feet and the second pass is  1 2/3 × 50 = 83 1/3 sq. ft.,  for a total of  (b) Chris has walked 200 feet. Note: Although some students  may initially argue that square  feet is a better measure of area for the lawn, they might find square inches easier to calculate because fractions are not involved.",13,mtms2010-11-256a,,
"87 1/2 + 83 1/3 = 170 5/6 sq. ft.  4.  The area of the lawn is     In inches, from question 1, the first  pass is 12,600 square inches and the second pass is  50 × 100 = 5,000 sq. ft.,    or  600 × 1200 = 720,000 sq. in.",14,mtms2010-11-256a,,
"20 × 600 = 12,000 sq. in., for a total of  12,600 + 12,000 = 24,600 sq. in.  (b) Chris has walked 100 feet, or 1200 inches.     Most students probably would  not think to calculate the area in square inches. The number of  passes is equal to the number of times that the lawn mower will  “fit into” the width of the yard, which is 1200 ÷ 20 = 60. The distance that Chris walks is  3.  (a) From the previous two ques- tions, we know that the first pass is 87 1/2 square feet and subsequent passes are each 83 1/3 square feet, so 4 passes would be    87 1/2 + (3)(83 1/3)   = 337 1/2 sq. ft.      60 passes × 50 ft. per pass   = 3000 ft.",15,mtms2010-11-256a,,
5.  The distance that Chris walks  would be equal to the number of area units if the number of passes he had to make was equal to the width of the yard and if the lawn mower was 1 foot wide. It is important to have students develop an understanding that the number of units is equal but that the type of unit is different.,16,mtms2010-11-256a,,
"In inches, the first pass is 12,600 square inches and subsequent passes are each 12,000 square inches, so the 4 passes are     12,600 + (3)12,000   = 48,600 sq. in. ",17,mtms2010-11-256a,,
