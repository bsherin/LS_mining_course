0,Dare to Compare - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"A recent trend in school mathematics has been to launch student inquiry with real-world contexts that capture student interest and intrigue (Meyer 2011, 2012; Kane 2015). Often these starting points harness the immediacy and power of the Internet to provide strong visuals and timely relevance. The goal of the resulting student inquiry is to foster conceptual and procedural understanding with authentic real-world applications, where the mathematics becomes a tool to enhance how students comprehend the world around them.",,
1,Dare to Compare - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I was impressed when a seventh-grade student initiated his own sense of mathematical intrigue during a lunch meeting with me for homework help. The school cafeterias regular single-serving circular pizza was temporarily replaced by a quarter slice from a larger pizza (see fig. 1). The student complained that his quarter slice had less pizza and did not taste as good as the regular pizza. I asked him how he could prove that the quarter slice was a worse deal. To answer that question, he took pictures of both the substitute and regular pizza, measured the pizzas with a ruler, wrote area formulas, plugged in measurements to calculate pizza areas, confirmed prices through his online student account, and then computed unit prices (cents per square inch of pizza).",,

3,Dare to Compare - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The unit price, or more generally a unit rate, is an important foundational concept in mathematics. For example, unit rate plays a prominent role in the development, interpretation, and application of the slope of lines in our seventh-grade course. I decided to expand the pizza example to a larger investigation of unit price and unit rate for all my seventh grade students. I was especially interested in pursuing studies in which students generated their own real-world examples, both to sustain their interest and allow them to choose how they focused their mathematical lens on the world. The project consisted of four lessons, one per quarter, each followed by an extended question that students were given one month to investigate (see table 1), allowing them time to search for their own examples to study and interpret in meaningful ways.",,
4,Dare to Compare - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
5,Dare to Compare - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Although the project and corresponding lessons were generally handled independently of the daily curriculum, some rich interaction occurred between the two. As students grew in content sophistication (slope, percentage change, area formulas, proportional thinking, elementary algebra), they incorporated some of their new knowledge in their project analyses. In return, having students study a topic in more depth throughout the year modeled for them good mathematical practice standards, such as using appropriate tools strategically to make sense of problems and reasoning quantitatively to construct viable arguments (CCSSI 2010). Most significantly, students experienced using mathematics to form an opinion and to support conclusions with mathematical reasoning.",,
6,Dare to Compare - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,COMPARING DIFFERENT SIZES,,
7,Dare to Compare - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In the first lesson, students were presented with different sizes of the same product, such as a 1.3-ounce container of Cheerios for $1.50 from the school cafeteria and an 18-ounce box of Cheerios for $2.50 from a grocery store (see fig. 2). I asked students to brainstorm different ways to compare the two items.",,
8,Dare to Compare - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
9,Dare to Compare - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The most popular student ideas were (1) to make ratios to compare price to weight, and (2) to use some sort of proportional reasoning (e.g., with the larger box you get over ten times as much cereal for less than twice the cost). Since the ultimate goal of the project was to focus on unit price and unit rate comparisons, I helped students formalize their ratio idea with the concept of unit price (the price of 1 ounce or 1 fluid ounce) and asked them to focus on that concept as a way to benchmark cost and determine the better deal. Students then computed unit prices of different product sizes and found dramatic differences, usually that larger product sizes have much smaller unit prices (see fig. 3a). When we discussed the results, most students acknowledged that they had not thought much about cost comparisons and seemed willing to accept cafeteria prices. Although some students felt that the small container was overpriced, many recognized its convenience factor and felt this probably justified the higher unit price.",,
10,Dare to Compare - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
11,Dare to Compare - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Students then had about a month to search for their own cost comparison of different sizes of the same product. Some students chose products they used frequently at school and home, some accompanied their parents on a shopping trip, and others searched online. The student-generated examples provided the opportunity for students to better appreciate the relevance of cost difference and to think more deeply about implications. Some students maintained that the convenience of small packages at school justified much higher unit prices.",,
12,Dare to Compare - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Tyler (pseudonyms are used throughout) calculated a 0.8-ounce bag of Popchips bought at school for $1.50 had a unit price of $1.88 per ounce, whereas a 1-ounce bag of Popchips in a 30-bag pack at Costco for $16.46 had a unit price of $0.55 per ounce. Tyler concluded, When youre buying something, you arent really paying for the quantity, but for the convenience. Lets say you were in a hurry, but you needed a snack. You could quickly run to the cafeteria and get what you need instead of having to go all the way to the store. However, some students recognized that they could save money by planning ahead. Lizzie compared peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and calculated a savings of 61 cents per ounce when buying the sandwich at Costco instead of the school cafeteria. Unlike Tyler, she said she would rather plan ahead, buy in bulk at Costco, and bring the sandwich to school (see fig. 3b).",,
13,Dare to Compare - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Some students recognized the obvious unit price advantage of purchasing larger quantities but achieved further insight by pointing out limitations of buying in bulk. Rachel compared a 24-pill with a 225-pill container of pain reliever and found that a pill from the smaller container was about 2.7 times more expensive than a pill from the larger container (see fig. 3c). Although she was surprised by the price difference, she thought that the smaller container was more cost effective: She used pain relievers rarely and anticipated that the pills in the larger container would expire before they would be used.",,
14,Dare to Compare - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"A small number of students produced examples that went against the general trend, in which the unit price was similar or even greater for the larger size. Owen compared a giant 5-pound Gummy Bear for $29.00 with a regular-size Gummy Bear from a 5-ounce package for $1.59. The larger Gummy Bear cost 36 cents per ounce; the smaller Gummy Bear cost 32 cents per ounce. Owen concluded, The 5-pound Gummy Bear is more of a novelty item than an actual product you would bring home to your family. These large Gummy Bears are not as largely produced as the smaller ones, which raises the price.",,
15,Dare to Compare - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"When we discussed unit prices in class one month after the opening lesson, students provided evidence of increased depth and sophistication of thinking. Students began the project with little to no appreciation of the notion of unit price comparisons. Within a few weeks, many were understanding subtleties and showing increased sophistication in their thinking: Lizzie used her unit price comparison to devise a plan for saving money at lunch (buy in bulk and freeze), Rachel recognized the limits of unit price comparison when quantity of product matters (pills may expire), and Owen found and explained a counterexample to the general unit price trend (larger items can have a higher unit price when they are less common).",,
16,Dare to Compare - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,COMPARING DIFFERENT PRODUCTS,,
17,Dare to Compare - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In the second lesson, students compared unit prices of different products, such as gasoline and bottled water. Students were given data for each item: 1 gallon (128 fluid ounces) of unleaded plus gasoline cost $3.70, and 23.6 fluid ounces of bottled water cost $1.50. They were then asked to calculate the unit price of each item (in cents per fluid ounce) and compare the results. Students determined the bottled waters unit price of 6.4 cents per fluid ounce was more than twice as expensive as the gasolines unit price of 2.9 cents per fluid ounce. Some students reacted strongly to the comparison, amazed that people were willing to spend more on water than on gasoline. Other students, however, accepted the price differences, perhaps because they did not have the life experience (e.g., car ownership) to contextualize the comparison of such different products.",,
18,Dare to Compare - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Students were given another month to search for their own cost comparison of different products. The instructions were simple and open-ended:,,
19,Dare to Compare - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"1. Choose two different products, in any size",,
20,Dare to Compare - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,2. Record the weight (or volume),,
21,Dare to Compare - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,3. Record the cost,,
22,Dare to Compare - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,4. Calculate the cost of 1 ounce (or 1 fluid ounce),,
23,Dare to Compare - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,5. Write a conclusion,,
24,Dare to Compare - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"As with the first lesson, extended time to choose products and perform individualized comparisons provided the opportunity for growth and increased depth in thinking. Spencer, who compared halibut fillets with pork and beans, was surprised to find the unit price of the fish was more than twenty times that of the pork and beans (see fig. 4a). Spencer then made a real-world connection, observing that one could feed twenty people 10 ounces of pork and beans each for the same price of a single 10-ounce fillet. Haley researched the cost of tap water (see fig. 4b), finding that it was much less expensive than bottled water. Separately, she also compared both types of water with the worlds most expensive bottled water and the worlds most expensive perfume.",,
25,Dare to Compare - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
26,Dare to Compare - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Sarah compared 16 fluid ounces of pressed juice for $6.50 with 16 fluid ounces of a McDonalds McCaf Vanilla Shake for $2.59. She found the juices 40.6 cents per fluid ounce to be about 2.5 times more expensive than the shakes 16.2 cents per fluid ounce. Her conclusions were representative of the thoughtful analysis that occurred as the project continued (see fig. 4c). By the end of the second lesson, students showed the ability to make meaningful comparisons of different products and draw inferences from these comparisons: Spencer used unit price to analyze the cost effectiveness of feeding people, Haley countered the gasoline and water comparison by showing how much less expensive was tap water, and Sarah invoked moderation and balance when weighing health benefits and cost.",,
27,Dare to Compare - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,COMPARING CAFETERIA PIZZA,,
28,Dare to Compare - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In the third lesson, students compared the two versions of pepperoni pizza sold by the school cafeteria. Ricky, the student who inspired the project, provided everyone with necessary pictures and measurements (and even made a guest appearance in another class to help initiate the lesson). Ricky had written a pizza scandal article for the school newspaper that had not been published, so the extended question for the third lesson was to give students a month to write their own article for the school newspaper. The cafeteria had returned to selling circular pizza, but we decided to submit our articles if the cafeteria switched back to its quarter-slice form. Students were encouraged to use as much mathematics as possible to analyze the situation and provide support in their article. The notion of supporting written explanations with mathematical reasoning was generally new to students, so revisions were allowed after the initial submission. I showed and discussed samples of some of the stronger student work in class, and then allowed students an extra two weeks to resubmit a final draft.",,
29,Dare to Compare - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The original circular pizza had a 7-inch diameter and cost $3.50. The quarter-circle pizza slice had an 11-inch diameter and also cost $3.50. The two pizzas had similar thickness, with the circular pizza being slightly thicker. Students were asked to compute unit prices in cents per square inch (rather than per ounce). Students found that the unit price increased from 9.1 cents/in. in the circular pizza to 14.7 cents/in., which represented a 62 percent increase in the unit price (see fig. 5a). We discussed in class that the unit price increase was not because of an increase in the cost of the pizza but to a decrease of the amount of pizza that a student received for the same price. A student would get less pizza for his or her money, which amounted to a greater price per square inch.",,
30,Dare to Compare - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
31,Dare to Compare - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In the student articles, some observed that the quarter slice had only 3 pieces of pepperoni compared with 5 pieces for the circular pizza. Others remarked that the empty space on the circular plate was visual evidence that the quarter slice had less area. Lisa contextualized the unit prices by thinking of a square inch as a bite of pizza: If you think about it, each bite of pizza you consume of the slice is costing you almost 15 cents, whereas each bite of the circular pizza is costing you around 9 cents. Justin observed this about the price increase, This is unfair, because kids, who often spend very little attention to the price of their lunches at the cafeteria, are spending more than they should be on the pizza when they buy a quarter slice.",,
32,Dare to Compare - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Some students noted that they just swiped their identification card at the cash register without even looking at prices. A few students argued that smaller pizza slices might actually be healthier for students. However, more students argued that the smaller amounts effectively represented a price increase because it forced hungry students to buy additional snacks to make up for the smaller portions. Daniel made this good suggestion, I say they should have both sizes for sale when they make pizzas. They could sell the full size for $3.50 and the quarter size for a significantly less amount of money. This would make everyone happy and also add more options when you buy lunch. To have the same unit price as the circular pizza (see fig. 5b), some students calculated the price of the quarter slice as $2.16. A few students calculated that the quarter slice would have to come from a 14-inch diameter pizza for it to have the same area as the original circular pizza (see fig. 5c).",,
33,Dare to Compare - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"By the third lesson, students were showing increased initiative and independence in their cost comparison calculations. Their analyses incorporated other mathematical tools learned throughout the year, such as area formulas, percentage change, proportion equations, and elementary algebraic equations. Their reasoning and interpretations included notions of fairness and unfairness, supported by mathematical arguments, and practical suggestions for making fair pricing decisions.",,
34,Dare to Compare - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,COMPARING UNIT RATES,,
35,Dare to Compare - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In the fourth lesson, students expanded their unit price comparisons to more general unit rate comparisons. The initiating activities focused on eating contests and the national debt. Students calculated that Joey Chestnuts record of 69 hot dogs in 10 minutes (at 290 calories per hot dog) meant that Joey ate at a rate of 2001 calories per minute (about a days worth of calories per minute). They also calculated that an $18.16 trillion national debt spread evenly across 117,840,000 taxpayers meant that $154,107 was owed per taxpayer. The calculations led to lively classroom discussions. Slater asked with a big smile on his face, Cant the government just print more money and pay everybody off? I was impressed when a few students responded that this would make the U.S. dollar worth less.",,
36,Dare to Compare - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Students were given one month to choose their own unit rate comparison. The results of this open-ended culminating activity were impressive and illustrated the richness and diversity of student comparisons. Gretchen calculated how many McDonalds Big Macs you could buy with 8 hours of minimum wage in 1967 and 2015 (see fig. 6a). She found that you can buy approximately one-half as many Big Macs today as you could in 1967, a powerful illustration of how the earning power of minimum wage has decreased over the last 50 years. Robbie computed the population density of Manhattan and compared it with the population density of the world (see fig. 6b). He then calculated that if the world had the population density of Manhattan it would have approximately 4 trillion people. Hayden calculated the running speed in feet per second of Usain Bolt and a cheetah, and found the cheetah was approximately 3 times as fast as Usain Bolt (see fig. 6c). He estimated that if Usain Bolt were 100 meters from a cheetah, it would take the cheetah only seconds to catch up to him.",,
37,Dare to Compare - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
38,Dare to Compare - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Personal interest fueled investigations that showed depth and sophistication. Eric studied scoring data of four Most Valuable Player candidates in the National Basketball Association, comparing season averages with averages over the last six games of the regular season. He explained how the comparisons related to the players role as the playoffs approached: A team whose position was secure in the playoffs rested a star player in the final stretch, whereas teams battling for position relied on the star player even more. Personal data came from family and friends and led to meaningful conclusions. Alex and his dad compared their heart rates at rest and after comparable exercise. The sons heart beat faster than his dads heart when at rest, but the fathers heart beat much faster than the sons after comparable exercise. Alex became curious to determine the number of heart beats in a lifetime, so he took a heart rate of 80 beats per minute and multiplied by 60  24  365  80 to calculate that a persons heart will beat over 3 billion times during an 80-year lifespan.",,
39,Dare to Compare - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Some students took advantage of timely current events. Evan studied the earning rates of his favorite athletes when he heard estimates that Floyd Mayweather would earn about $180 million in the Floyd MayweatherManny Pacquiao fight. On the basis of these estimates, Evan calculated that Mayweather earned $83,333.00 per second of the fight, almost twice as much as the average U.S. worker earns in a year. See the sidebar (on p. 467) for a sampling of topics analyzed.",,
40,Dare to Compare - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Students were free to choose their topic, and their methods of research were also varied: Some students did experiments to collect data (reading, typing, talking, knitting, and checking heart beat rates), some examined everyday objects (sugar content of soft drinks and apple juice), some did online research to study a subject they already knew well (sports statistics and high performance cars), and some researched online or in books to study an unfamiliar topic that interested them (earning rates, wingspans, and energy sources). With the fourth and culminating lesson, unit price comparisons evolved into rich and diverse unit rate comparisons in which students showed the ability to use mathematics to make meaningful real-world comparisons.",,
41,Dare to Compare - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,HARNESSING STUDENT POWER TO CREATE INTRIGUE,,
42,Dare to Compare - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"When searching for authentic real-world applications of mathematics, it is not always possible to choose contexts that immediately resonate with all students. In fact, one might argue that the true goal of learning is to have students depart with a greater sense of interest and intrigue than when they started. In the Dare to Compare project, many students did not have the life experiences or perspectives to have strong initial reactions to unit price or unit rate comparisons. For some, the cost comparison between different amounts or types of a product was a new concept. However, sustained thinking about unit price and unit rate, modeled in context and then fueled by individual inquiry, led to greater understanding. Students learned to view the world through a mathematical lens and then began seeing the world differently.",,
43,Dare to Compare - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Launching an activity with an intriguing real-world context provides a powerful tool for teachers to spark student interest. Perhaps an even stronger tool is to then allow students to create their own contexts and sense of intrigue. It is not uncommon for students to think of writing and mathematics as separate topics, but when using mathematics to make their own real-world comparisons, the students naturally saw description and written explanation as part of their answer. Persisting over time with the theme of unit prices and unit rates, providing opportunities for spiraling back and looking more deeply, gave students an increasing sense of ownership with a mathematical concept and its role in quantifying and understanding our world.",,
