1,Pruning Trees - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Five teachers from across the country submitted the work of twenty students for the Pruning Trees problem.,,
2,Pruning Trees - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Five strategies, employing ratio tables, the least common multiple, rates, guess and check, and algebraic equations, were used to solve this problem, as identified from the student work submitted.",,
3,Pruning Trees - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In her reflection about the problem and her instructional strategy, Annie Perkins wrote,",,
4,Pruning Trees - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Knowing that several of my students would need assistance with this problem, but wanting to give them as little teacher direction as possible, I presented the problem to all of my students, and encouraged them to use a technique weve discussed before of replacing the numbers in the problem with nice numbers. Students talked about it for a minute, and then decided that Keith would take 30 minutes to prune a tree, and Richard would take 60 minutes. After working out a solution with these numbers, they could return to the original values.",,
5,Pruning Trees - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Perkins also noted in her reflection that when first presented with the problem, students",,
6,Pruning Trees - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"jumped to the incorrect conclusion that it would take both Keith and Richard 90 minutes to complete a tree together. Fortunately, I didnt even need to step in before a discussion among them revealed the problem with that. Clearly, if Keith only takes 30 minutes, it doesnt make sense that it would take them both 90.",,
7,Pruning Trees - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,This is the type of mathematical thinking encouraged by the Common Cores Standards for Mathematical Practice (CCSSI 2010). We applaud Perkinss use of this scaffolding technique and her desire to keep the responsibility for solving the problem on her students.,,
8,Pruning Trees - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Jennifer Marshall had sixth-, seventh-, and eighth-grade students complete the problems. She reported that sixth graders typically started the problem by listing multiples of 40 and 75. However, after listing between 5 and 10 multiples, the students became discouraged that they had not found any common multiples. Some students then moved on to use various algorithms to identify the lowest common multiple (LCM) (630); however, they had difficultly identifying how the LCM related to the solution of the problem.",,
9,Pruning Trees - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Anna Maria DIppolito submitted Bimbas work, which exemplified the LCM strategy (see fig. 1). This method was also used by Rhodia Constantinidous student, Nicholas; Cris Wellingtons student, Elaina; and Jennifer Marshalls student, Caiden. Space limitations prevent us from showing all these students work, but Nicholas explained that finding the least common multiple of 45 and 70 yielded the shortest time in which Keith and Richard could both cut a whole number of trees, 630 minutes. During this time, Keith pruned 14 trees, Richard pruned 9 trees, and together they pruned 23 trees. He then divided the total number of trees (92) by 23 to determine that they would need to complete this time frame four times to prune all 92 trees. It also meant that 630 minutes times 4 tells us how many minutes to prune all 92 trees2,520 minutes, or 42 hours (see fig. 1).",,
10,Pruning Trees - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
11,Pruning Trees - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"A similar method involved ratio tables used by both a student in Perkinss class, and Nicole, a student in Constantinidous class (see fig. 2).",,
12,Pruning Trees - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
13,Pruning Trees - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Several students also used rates to solve the problem. However, the rates they used were different. Students Leo and Dimitrios (in Wellingtons class) determined the number of trees per hour for each person (see fig. 3a). Brooke, a fifth grader whose work was submitted by DIppolito, computed the number of trees each person could cut in 10 hours (see fig. 3b).",,
14,Pruning Trees - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
15,Pruning Trees - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Brooke had several pages of supporting calculations and ruminations, but what impressed us was the final summary of her work, organized so that she could make sense of what she had done. Although her result was not exact because of her lack of familiarity with decimal and fractional remainders, her reasoning was correct. It should be noted that fifth graders are not expected to have mastered decimal and fractional remainders, yet Brooke was still able to access the mathematical concepts developed by this task, using a mathematical model to help her.",,
16,Pruning Trees - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Marshalls seventh-grade and eighth-grade students used a variety of guess-and-check methods. When using this approach, many students started by thinking about the time it would take for Keith and Richard to each cut half of the 92 trees. In doing so, students quickly recognized that Richard would take longer than Keith to cut 46 trees, so this solution was incorrect because both must work the same amount of time. Matt and Jarrod were able to improve their guess by increasing the number of trees Keith pruned by 1 and decreasing the number that Richard pruned by 1. They iterated these steps until the time was the same for both Richard and Keith. Other students increased or decreased by 10 trees at a time to speed up the process (see fig. 4).",,
17,Pruning Trees - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
18,Pruning Trees - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Several seventh-grade and eighth-grade students were keen on developing a system of equations to find the solution to this problem. Many students easily identified the equation x + y = 92, where x is the number of trees Keith pruned and y is the number of trees that Richard pruned. However, they had more difficulty coming up with a second equation, such as 45x = 70y, which would have allowed them to solve the system.",,
19,Pruning Trees - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Austin (in Marshalls class) did write the equation (45/70)x = y but did not use formal methods to solve the system of equations. Instead, this student used a ratio to compare the number of trees that Keith and Richard could prune. He realized that 70/45 equals 1.555/1 and that this ratio was approximately equal to 3/2, meaning that Keith would cut down approximately 3 trees in the same time that Richard could cut 2 trees. Using this approximation, Austin reasoned that if the 92 trees were divided into 5 groups, Keith would be responsible for pruning 3/5 of the trees, and Richard would prune 2/5 of the trees. He calculated that Keith should prune 36.8 trees, whereas Richard should prune 55.2 trees (see fig. 5).",,
20,Pruning Trees - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
21,Pruning Trees - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,He rounded the 36.8 to 37 and 55.2 to 55 and found that Richard worked more minutes on his side than Keith. He adjusted the numbers to 36 trees for Richard and 56 trees for Keith so that they both worked the same number of minutes.,,
22,Pruning Trees - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Joey, another student in Marshalls class, realized that for every 1 tree that Keith pruned, Richard pruned approximately 0.64 of a tree. He used this information to write the equation 1x + 0.64x = 92. Solving this equation allowed him to find the number of trees pruned by Keith. Although he did not write a second equation, finding the relationship between Keith and Richards tree pruning rates allowed him to use an equation to solve the problem. This student used a part-to-part ratio to solve the problem; Austin used part-to-whole reasoning. Both informally solved the system of equations using ratios.",,
23,Pruning Trees - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"This problem allowed for differentiation because many solution strategies could be used, and students from all middle school grade levels could access the problem. It also addressed several of the middle-grades content standards and several of the mathematical practices.",,
24,Pruning Trees - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We would like to thank these teachers, their students, and their schools for allowing us to use their work.",,

30,Pruning Trees - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,The willingness of teachers and students to share their students work and their use of the task with MTMS readers benefits the mathematics education profession. It also allows us to provide other middle school math teachers with insights into the use of nontraditional tasks and into the thinking of students.,,
