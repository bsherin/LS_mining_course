0,Generalizing and Skepticism_ Bringing Research to Practice - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"A call exists for students to understand reasoning and proving in the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSI 2010) and other documents, such as Principles to Actions: Ensuring Mathematical Success for All (NCTM 2014). Students often struggle with proving. One frequent difficulty they exhibit is relying on empirical arguments as opposed to searching for more secure reasoning, such as exhausting all cases or using deduction.",,
1,Generalizing and Skepticism_ Bringing Research to Practice - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Empirical arguments rely on examples without necessarily addressing all cases. Students produce invalid empirical arguments when they test a few cases (or examples) in the domain of a claim without exhausting all cases. Such arguments are insecure because the argument does not eliminate the possibility of a counterexample among the untested cases. Students who assert that the empirical evidence is proof express nave empiricism (Balacheff 1988). Students should be skeptical of empirical evidence and should seek more secure arguments for generalizations, such as those that explain why a generalization is true for all cases. Otherwise, students should not overgeneralize their findings and should restrict their claims to only those cases actually tested.",,
2,Generalizing and Skepticism_ Bringing Research to Practice - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Generalizing on the basis of patterns in data is an important mathematical practice; however, overgeneralizing can occur when students focus solely on patterns in their data results. Students should also determine whether patterns are expressed in the processes used to construct data (Harel 2001). In this way, students can link patterns in their processes to patterns in their results and perhaps explain why patterns hold for all cases.",,
3,Generalizing and Skepticism_ Bringing Research to Practice - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We should not discourage students from making such conjectures. However, we should encourage skepticism. Students should claim that their arguments for generalizations are secure only when their arguments are viable. Viable arguments for generalization include deductive arguments and arguments that exhaust all cases. These arguments can be accepted as proof even though some of the formality might be absent. Arguments based on patterns in data are viable and secure only when students can explain how patterns they observe hold for all cases in their claims domains. In this article, we offer activities that encourage skepticism and a way to contrast empirical arguments that are not viable with empirical arguments that are viable, even when students lack sufficient deductive-reasoning skills.",,
4,Generalizing and Skepticism_ Bringing Research to Practice - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Our skepticism work with our own grade 8 students should be useful to others who teach in the middle grades. The data presented in this article are from a teaching experiment with a class in which more than 60 percent of students scored below proficient on their 2015 Grade 7 Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium end-of-year assessments (SBAC 2012).,,
5,Generalizing and Skepticism_ Bringing Research to Practice - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND PREVIOUS STUDIES,,
6,Generalizing and Skepticism_ Bringing Research to Practice - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"A learning progression toward more secure forms of argumentation can include interventions that produce skepticism. Researchers have tested a variety of interventions for developing skepticism in students (Stylianides and Stylianides 2009; Brown 2014). One approach is to simply tell students that empirical evidence does not prove a generalization (Brown 2014). Another approach is to engage students in activities in which they are likely to develop generalizations on the basis of the results from examining the first few cases, only to discover that their generalizations are false. This approach can place students in cognitive disequilibrium. Students can resolve their disequilibrium by modifying their beliefs about what constitutes viable argumentation in mathematics.",,
7,Generalizing and Skepticism_ Bringing Research to Practice - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Stylianides and Stylianides (2009) identify two conditions for counter-examples that make skepticism activities pivotal in improving students conceptions of proof. One condition is that the counterexamples are outside the examples that students have already grasped but inside the collection of examples that students could grasp with appropriate assistance. The other condition is that the counterexamples to students overgeneralizations help students reflect on their existing conceptions of proof.,,
8,Generalizing and Skepticism_ Bringing Research to Practice - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,SKEPTICISM ACTIVITIES,,
9,Generalizing and Skepticism_ Bringing Research to Practice - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"It is unlikely that one activity alone will produce sufficient skepticism in grade 8 students. Researchers (e.g., Stylianides and Stylianides 2009) have used a sequence of activities to target skepticism outcomes. Table 1 offers examples of activities that can produce skepticism. In this article, we look in depth at just one of these activities, the Circle and Spot Activity, but offer others, which we also implemented in grade 8 classrooms. The Circle and Spot Activity is great for producing overgeneralizations, and then skepticism, among students because an insecure argument is likely to emerge. Students are likely to find a pattern in the results after examining the first four cases but are unlikely to find a pattern in the process.",,
10,Generalizing and Skepticism_ Bringing Research to Practice - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
11,Generalizing and Skepticism_ Bringing Research to Practice - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,THE CIRCLE AND SPOT ACTIVITY,,
12,Generalizing and Skepticism_ Bringing Research to Practice - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Day 1: Overgeneralizing,,
13,Generalizing and Skepticism_ Bringing Research to Practice - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We began the Circle and Spot Activity by asking students to respond to prompt (a) in table 1. We expected students to test cases with a few spots (e.g., 2, 3, 4, and 5) and then generalize these results to other cases. This is not what happened. Every student began with a relatively large number of spots (more than 6). Figure 1 illustrates one students first example.",,
14,Generalizing and Skepticism_ Bringing Research to Practice - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
15,Generalizing and Skepticism_ Bringing Research to Practice - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Placing more than 6 spots on the circles and connecting dots with line segments made students diagrams unwieldy. Attempted to count the regions created was nearly impossible for them to do correctly. We encouraged students to explore cases with a fewer number of spots, such as 2, 3, 4, or 5. In so doing, we were baiting the hook. We knew that these cases would result in 2, 4, 8, and 16 regions, respectively, and that a pattern in their results would emerge.",,
16,Generalizing and Skepticism_ Bringing Research to Practice - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"After students explored these more manageable cases, we collected their work. We selected and displayed on the overhead projector one piece of work for each of the cases 2, 3, 4, and 5, sequencing them in order from case 2 to 5.",,
17,Generalizing and Skepticism_ Bringing Research to Practice - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We constructed a two-column chart to record our data: one column for the number of spots and the other column for the number of created regions. Three students had explored the case n = 6, but when they voiced their skepticism about the pattern expressed in the results from cases 2 through 5, the majority of students disagreed with them, asserting that the skeptical students had made a mistake in their construction of case n = 6. They asserted that the doubling pattern held for all cases. At this point, we did not intervene. One purpose of the activity was to allow students to overgeneralize, thus letting them experience disequilibrium when faced with a counterexample.",,
18,Generalizing and Skepticism_ Bringing Research to Practice - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We asked students to address the second prompt that asked,",,
19,Generalizing and Skepticism_ Bringing Research to Practice - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"When there are 15 spots in different locations on the circle, is there an easy way to tell for sure what is the greatest number of nonoverlapping regions into which the circle can be divided?",,
20,Generalizing and Skepticism_ Bringing Research to Practice - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The last prompt was worded so that students had the option of responding with No, there is not an easy way to determine the number of regions for 15 spots or Yes, the doubling pattern found in the data tells us that the number of regions is 16,404. Most of our students (11 out of 15) generalized the results in the data and asserted that a circle with 15 spots created 16,404 regions. Figure 2 illustrates the work of Charli, a representative case for this type of overgeneralizing.",,
21,Generalizing and Skepticism_ Bringing Research to Practice - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
22,Generalizing and Skepticism_ Bringing Research to Practice - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Our three skeptical students held fast to their earlier assertion that the results pattern breaks at the case n = 6 and that the case n = 15 is uncertain. Figure 3 also illustrates a representative example of this type of response.,,
23,Generalizing and Skepticism_ Bringing Research to Practice - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
24,Generalizing and Skepticism_ Bringing Research to Practice - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We encouraged students to write their findings in the form of a viable argument, which needed to include some important argument features: (1) an explicit claim using for-all or there-exists language; (2) an explicit foundation, such as a referent (e.g., a diagram or an equation) that illustrated why the claim holds for all cases in the domain of the claim; and (3) a narrative (prose) that linked the foundation to the claim, explaining how the foundation was used to support the claim. At the end of the first day of the activity, we asked students to construct claims, either generalizations or existence statements. Several claims that our students generated are below:",,
25,Generalizing and Skepticism_ Bringing Research to Practice - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"1. Tom: On a circle, for any point or spot added, the number of regions will double.",,
26,Generalizing and Skepticism_ Bringing Research to Practice - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"2. Kenji: If the number of points is less than 6, then you can multiply a number and it will double.",,
27,Generalizing and Skepticism_ Bringing Research to Practice - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,3. Helen: There exists no easy way to tell how many nonoverlapping regions.,,
28,Generalizing and Skepticism_ Bringing Research to Practice - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Claim 1 is a false generalization. It describes a recursive pattern for determining how many regions for the next case. It does not tell us how to determine the number of regions explicitly. Claim 2 is a generalization with a restricted domain. This generalization is true. But like claim 1, it describes a recursive pattern without telling us how to determine the number of regions explicitly. Claim 3 uses there exists language, but the statement is not an existence claim. Existence claims only assert that something exists without necessarily claiming how frequently it exists. Counterexamples motivate existence claims (e.g., A counterexample exists). Helens claim, a generalization, was that among all possible ways, none of the ways work. Claim 3 might be difficult to prove. There is a difference between proving that a particular way does not work and proving that no way works.",,
29,Generalizing and Skepticism_ Bringing Research to Practice - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Day 2: Crafting Viable Arguments,,
30,Generalizing and Skepticism_ Bringing Research to Practice - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"On the second day of the activity, we reviewed the claims made the day before. We asked the students to construct a circle with 6 spots and determine the number of regions created. Some students constructed 30 regions, and some constructed 31 regions. An example of each type was displayed on the overhead projector.",,
31,Generalizing and Skepticism_ Bringing Research to Practice - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Figure 4 illustrates a response with 30 regions. Steve, whose work was illustrated earlier in figure 3, discovered he actually had 31 regions in his construction. We discussed how the example with 31 regions could be transformed to have 30 regions by moving 1 spot on the circle, so that three line segments intersected.",,
32,Generalizing and Skepticism_ Bringing Research to Practice - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
33,Generalizing and Skepticism_ Bringing Research to Practice - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Students discussed these examples and how they demonstrated inherent trouble with empirical evidence. Students concluded that empirical evidence was not sufficient for generalizations. Some went as far as to mention being cautious in the future when extending patterns found in the results of a few cases to all cases. Others mentioned that our findings from the case with 6 spots opened the possibility that a circle with 15 spots would have multiple correct answers for the number of regions. (What a great opportunity to discuss function concepts!),,
34,Generalizing and Skepticism_ Bringing Research to Practice - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We introduced the term counter-example to the class and summarized the findings. Students had already worked with exponents, so we helped the students who used recursive thinking express their findings with exponent notation. We noted that the case n = 6 was a counterexample to the claim for all cases, the number of regions created is 2n-1, where n is the number of spots on the circle.",,
35,Generalizing and Skepticism_ Bringing Research to Practice - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"It was not necessary to express the incorrect pattern in exponent notation. Students who expressed their findings in a recursive pattern (e.g., doubling the number of regions as the spots increase by 1) also observed that the recursive pattern did not hold for the case n = 6. Because we emphasize teaching and learning through and with viable argumentation in our classrooms, we encouraged students to summarize their learning by constructing viable arguments. To us, this emphasis meant asking students to make claims that summarize their findings and writing viable arguments for those claims. We asked students to respond to the following prompts to achieve these goals:",,

38,Generalizing and Skepticism_ Bringing Research to Practice - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,THE VIABLE ARGUMENT BIG PICTURE,,
39,Generalizing and Skepticism_ Bringing Research to Practice - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Charlis response expressed a number of viable-argument practices that are important to students as they situate skepticism among their conceptions of viable argumentation, in general. In part (a), Charli expressed the domain to which an argument applies (CCSSI 2010, p. 3) by restricting her claim to only those cases tested. By displaying each case, she analyze[d] situations by breaking them into cases (CCSSI 2010, p. 3). Charlis cases can also be viewed using concrete referents such as objects, drawings, diagrams, and actions (CCSSI 2010, p. 3). In part (b), Charli recognize[d] and use[d] [a] counterexample",,
40,Generalizing and Skepticism_ Bringing Research to Practice - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"(CCSSI 2010, p. 3). The existence claim in part (b) expressed an important concept: A single counterexample is sufficient to disprove a generalization.",,
41,Generalizing and Skepticism_ Bringing Research to Practice - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"These excerpts from the Common Core, albeit cumbersome, demonstrate our overarching point. Skepticism activities can address many features of viable argumentation described in the Standard for Mathematical Practice 3: Construct viable arguments and critique the arguments of others.",,
42,Generalizing and Skepticism_ Bringing Research to Practice - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"For teachers who wish to use these activities to promote productive counterexample searches, the Prime Output Activity in figure 1 offers excellent opportunities. Both 40 and 41 are counterexamples, as are all multiples of 41. Some students notice immediately that an input of 41 will result in a 41 occurring in each term. Such immediate student observations, however, are rare. When they occur, an opportunity for more general and perhaps deductive reasoning emerges.",,
43,Generalizing and Skepticism_ Bringing Research to Practice - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"After students discover that 41 is a counterexample, they can be encouraged to look for an infinite collection of counterexamples. By looking at examples such as",,
44,Generalizing and Skepticism_ Bringing Research to Practice - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"f(41  2) = (41  2)2 + (41  2) + 41,",,
45,Generalizing and Skepticism_ Bringing Research to Practice - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"students can observe a pattern in both the process and in the results. The process of inputting a multiple of 41 places a 41 in each of the terms in the output. By observing that a 41 can be factored from the output, a pattern in the results is discovered. Because the 2 can be replaced with any integer and the process still works, our example serves as a generic example (Yopp and Ely 2016) that can be used as a referent in a viable argument about multiples of 41.",,
46,Generalizing and Skepticism_ Bringing Research to Practice - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"A detailed description of how to support students in making these more general arguments is beyond the scope of this article. However, we do offer a way to contrast viable example-based arguments from those that are flawed. As illustrated in figure 5, part (a), students can be encouraged to restrict their claims to the cases that they have tested when they do not have an argument that addresses all cases.",,
47,Generalizing and Skepticism_ Bringing Research to Practice - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
48,Generalizing and Skepticism_ Bringing Research to Practice - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,IMPLEMENTATION ADVICE,,
49,Generalizing and Skepticism_ Bringing Research to Practice - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Implementing skepticism activities can be straightforward. A teacher can give any of the prompts in table 1 and ask students to explore the truth of the claim or to derive their own claim. We have implemented theses activities in twelve different grade 8 classrooms in four school districts serving approximately 300 students. The majority of the students overgeneralized without any instructions beyond those given in the prompts.,,
50,Generalizing and Skepticism_ Bringing Research to Practice - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"A teacher may encourage students to find their own counterexample(s), but we do not feel this is necessary for students to experience cognitive disequilibrium and reflect on the viability of their arguments. In fact, we cannot expect students to find the monstrous counterexample; it would take numerous lifetimes to find it! That is the point: Being skeptical means not overgeneralizing even though you cannot find a counterexample. In other words, just because you cannot find a counterexample does not mean that a counterexample is not out there.",,
51,Generalizing and Skepticism_ Bringing Research to Practice - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,LEARNING LIMITATIONS OF EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE,,
52,Generalizing and Skepticism_ Bringing Research to Practice - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The activity was effective in improving students understanding of the limitations of empirical evidence as support for a generalization. The counterexample to the false pattern (6 spots) met the two conditions of pivotal (Stylianides and Stylianides 2009) for the students who failed to acknowledge the counterexample on day 1. These students had not explored the example correctly, and yet the example was accessible. Once directed toward this example, the students constructed a correct diagram and correctly determine the number of regions. These students then reflected on limitations of examples when proving.",,
53,Generalizing and Skepticism_ Bringing Research to Practice - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We have found that all the skepticism activities in table 1 are accessible to grade 8 students and are effective in producing skepticism. Some of our grade 8 students developed a habit of skepticism after the first activity, but most required multiple exposures. Most students developed skepticism after the first three activities; however, a handful of students required constant reminders.",,
54,Generalizing and Skepticism_ Bringing Research to Practice - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Our link between skepticism activities and the Common Cores content standards (see the last column of table 1) is important and makes our work unique and distinct from previous work. Some of our colleagues have expressed concerns about focusing too much on viable argumentation. They worry that too much attention to this mathematical practice can take away from teaching content. By linking the activities to the content standards, we demonstrate that the activities can complement and enhance the learning of content.",,
55,Generalizing and Skepticism_ Bringing Research to Practice - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We also point out how our implementation differs from that described in other articles. Stylianides and Stylianides (2009) use an activity where a process pattern does hold for all (infinitely many) cases to help students contrast viable arguments for generalizations with arguments that are not viable. We do this as well. However, we also emphasize the practice of restricting claims to finite domains to avoid overgeneralizing. Purely example-based arguments can be viable when the domain of the claim is finite. In other words, the method of exhausting all cases in the domain of the claim is a viable mode of argumentation.",,
56,Generalizing and Skepticism_ Bringing Research to Practice - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"This practice has been important in our teaching. Most students enter our classes with a good understanding of arguments that exhaust all cases. By encouraging students to restrict their claims, we are able to leverage students prior knowledge and draw clear distinctions between claims with domains that can be exhausted and claims with domains that cannot be exhausted. We are cautious about not inadvertently discouraging ambitious conjecturing, but we do draw distinctions between conjecturing and making claims that students can viably support. Next steps are to support students in understanding how to develop and use generic referents and deduction to argue for claims with infinite domains, but that is a topic for another article.",,
