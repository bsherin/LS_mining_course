Name ______________________________   b.  About how many gallons of whole milk have the same amount of fat as 1 quart of half and half? 4. Whipping cream has a fat content of about 36% and is often sold in half pints.    a.  How many gallons of 2% milk  have the same amount of fat as 1 half pint of whipping cream?   b.  About how many quarts of whole milk have the same amount of fat as 1 half pint of whipping cream? c.  How many quarts of half and half have the same amount of fat as 1 half pint of whipping cream? 5.  One gallon of whole milk contains about 128 grams of fat. Suppose you pour yourself an 8-ﬂ uid-ounce glass of whole milk and then accidently spill half the milk out of the glass. How many grams of fat are in the milk that remains in the glass? ,2,mtms2013-05-532a,,

"WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER 98%? 1. Why is the father comparing his  1 gallon of whole milk with 50 gallons of 2% milk? 2. In the United States, 2% milk means that 2% of the weight of the milk is fat. For whole milk, 3.25% of the weight is fat.    a.  How many times as much fat is  in 1 gallon of whole milk as in 1 gallon of 2% milk?    b.  How many gallons of 2% milk  have the same amount of fat as 1 gallon of whole milk?",4,mtms2013-05-532a,,

"SOLUTIONS 1.  Perhaps the father is assuming that  whole milk is 100% fat and that the average person can only afford to buy 2% of what a rich person can afford. As the next question states, whole milk is not 100% fat.  2.  a.  Whole milk has 3.25/2 = 1.625  or 1 5/8 times as much fat as 2% milk.    b.  1 5/8 gallons, or 1.625 gallons.",7,mtms2013-05-532a,,

"c.  6 1/2 quarts (or 6 quarts and 1 pint). Since 4 quarts are in a gallon, you need four times as many quarts as gallons of 2% milk in answer (b), or 4 × 1 5/8 gal. of 2% milk. ",10,mtms2013-05-532a,,
FIELD-TEST COMMENTS,11,mtms2013-05-532a,,
"I used this activity with my urban, heterogeneously grouped eighth graders at the end of the school year. For students to get invested in the problem, I brought to the classroom a sampling of juices (some 100% juice and some not) and types of milk (2%, low fat, skim, chocolate, and so on). Students began class by writing and talking about their milk preferences and why some juices are 100% juice and others not. We clariﬁ ed that a 100% juice description is different from a 2% milk description, as the percentage description in the latter refers only to the percentage of fat. This preview was necessary so that all my students could understand and, therefore, laugh at the cartoon.",12,mtms2013-05-532a,,
"To begin solving the problems, students used a variety of methods,  3.  a.  1.5625, or 1 9/16, gallons. Half and half has 12.5/2 = 6.25 times as much fat as 2% milk. Because 4 quarts are in a gallon, you divide 6.25 by 4.",13,mtms2013-05-532a,,
"c.  About 3/4 quart. Whipping  cream has 36/12.5 = 2 11/12.5 times as much fat as half and half. Since there are 4 half pints in a quart, divide this result by 4.    b.  0.9625, or about 1 gallon. ",14,mtms2013-05-532a,,
"Whole milk has 12.5/3.25 = 3 11/13 or about 3.85 as much fat as whole milk. (Most students are unlikely to make the conversion to 13ths.) Because 4 quarts are in a gallon, you divide this result by 4.  4.  a.  1 gallon and 1 pint, or  1 1/8 gallons. Whipping cream has 36/2 = 18 times as much fat as 2% milk. Two pints (or 4 half pints) are in a quart, and 4 quarts are in a gallon.",15,mtms2013-05-532a,,
"  b.  About 11/4, or about 2.75,  quarts. Whipping cream has 36/3.25 or about 11 times as much fat as whole milk. There are 2 pints (or 4 half pints) in a quart, so divide 11 by 4.  including setting up and solving proportions or equations. I appreciated this review and the valuable discussion that resulted from students sharing their various methods. It was easy for many of my students to overlook the multiple conversions needed to answer the speciﬁ c question asked. I wished that I had predicted this struggle, provided visuals of the different containers involved, and allowed students to practice converting between units before giving the assignment. If I use this again, I will ask students to work on all the problems in groups during class instead of assigning remaining problems for homework. Students might have had fewer struggles early on while working on the assignment if I had suggested they change the percentages to fat grams. Even though I wish I had implemented  5.  4 grams. There are 128 ﬂ uid ounces in 1 gallon; 128/8 or 16 cups (each cup holds 8 ﬂ uid ounces). Because 128 grams of fat are in 1 gallon of whole milk, 1 cup has 128/16 or 8 grams of fat. For 1/2 cup of whole milk, divide by 2. Students might also use mental math to see that if 128 ounces (1 gallon) has 128 grams of fat, each ounce has 1 gram of fat. Thus, 4 ounces of whole milk will have 4 grams of fat.  6. a.  About 100.81 grams of fat for  whole milk. Since 1 liter ≈ 1.06 quarts, 3 liters ≈ 3.18 quarts. Thus, 3 liters of whole milk will have 3.18 × 31.7.",16,mtms2013-05-532a,,
"b.  About 62.01 grams of fat for  2% milk. For 3 liters of 2% milk, multiply 3.18 × 19.5.  it differently, I sincerely appreciate the assignment for the problem solving, reasoning, and computational skills it required students to apply. ",17,mtms2013-05-532a,,

OTHER IDEAS,21,mtms2013-05-532a,,
"If only a small percentage of milk is fat, what ingredients are in the rest? Research these nonfat ingredients. Compare the fat content of regular, low-fat, and nonfat versions of other products. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) recommends that children ages 4–18 consume no more than 25% to 35% of their calories from fat. Investigate which milk products will help children stay within this USDA recommendation. ",22,mtms2013-05-532a,,
