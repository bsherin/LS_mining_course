Principles and Standards for School Mathematics  states  that  students  in  middle  school are expected to “apply transformations and use symmetry to analyze mathematical situations” (p. 232). Our students have also been challenged to “recognize and apply mathematics in contexts outside of mathematics” (p. 274) and to “create and use representations to organize, record, and communicate ",3,mtms2007-05-516a,,

"mathematical ideas” (p. 280). using card-stock paper, glue, gold spray paint (optional), and as many varieties  of  pasta  as  I  could  find,  I  gave  my  sixthgrade  middle  school  students  the  opportunity  to convince me that they understood the concepts of reflectional and/or rotational symmetry while creating a unique piece of art.

"We  had  completed  the  traditional  tasks  of  finding  symmetry  in  geometric  figures,  objects  in  nature, letters of the alphabet, and so on. However, I wanted my students to do more than identify symmetry;  I  wanted  them  to  create  symmetry.  Since  I taught 150 students each day, I wanted to use materials that were sturdy and easy to find; that came in many different sizes, shapes, and colors; and that were inexpensive. After wandering through several businesses containing teacher supplies, I ended up in the pasta aisle at the grocery store. The shapes, sizes, and colors of pasta were just what I was looking for (you could also use dried beans of various shapes  and  sizes).  I  purchased  bow  ties,  wheels, spaghetti, shells, rigatoni, penne, twists, and ruffles, stopping at twenty varieties. ",8,mtms2007-05-516a,,
"To begin, all the pasta was emptied into a large plastic container with a secure lid and mixed well. I gave each student a 9 × 12 piece of card stock and a bottle of glue, and each group of four students received a shoebox filled with mixed pasta. They were given the following  four  choices  to  use  in  creating  their  symmetrical  designs:  horizontal  reflectional  symmetry, vertical reflectional symmetry, horizontal and vertical ",9,mtms2007-05-516a,,

Students  were  told  to  cover  the  entire  sheet  of card stock with as many different types of pasta as possible. They used the long spaghetti pieces to indicate lines of symmetry or angles of rotation. A few questions were asked before the glue started to flow. “Can we make words?” “Can we make faces?” “Can we make buildings?” “Can we just have a design?” ,14,mtms2007-05-516a,,
"The  room  quickly  became  silent  as  students worked  feverishly  to  finish  150  very  creative  and unique pieces of mathematical art. The ideas were as  varied  as  the  students  themselves;  some  were simple  yet  elegant,  some  were  rather  predictable, and others were a wild mix of shape and color. All were  obviously  created  with  pride  and  dedication to detail. When rob glued his penne pasta with the point facing the wrong direction, Sara nudged him to turn it around. When joe needed one more wheel to complete a part of his design, Abdul handed him one from his group’s shoebox. The cooperation and concentration were wonderful sights to behold. ",15,mtms2007-05-516a,,
"When  the  designs  were  complete  and  the  glue was dry, the students had the option of having their design given the “Midas touch” by taking it outside  and spraying it with gold paint. The resulting pieces of art were easy to grade. The projects were worth 50 points—up to 30 points for correct examples of symmetry, up to 10 points for using multiple pasta shapes, and up to 10 points for creativity and design. It was immediately clear which students understood symmetry (the overwhelming majority) and which students did not (very few). The projects were displayed during parent-teacher conference night and were  the  talk  of  the  school.  Students  learned  that symmetry was not something they just had to identify,  but,  by  connecting  mathematics  to  art,  they could create a physical model that would represent and convey the properties of reflectional and/or rotational symmetry to others. This activity seemed to be enjoyed by all students, especially those with different learning styles. ",16,mtms2007-05-516a,,
"Since creativity was definitely the key to success, those  with  language,  reading,  or  mathematics  issues were free to “show what you know” without being  constrained  by  a  paper-and-pencil  assignment. Many students who had never been in the mathematics spotlight could now enjoy a few minutes of stardom. l ",17,mtms2007-05-516a,,
