4,Jasons Scramble,"JASON’S JUMBLE 1. To complete the Jumble, unscramble each number on the right to satisfy the mathematical description to its left. For example, the fi rst description calls for a multiple of 117. Because 0882 is not a multiple of 118, you need to rearrange the digits 0882 to produce a number that is a multiple of 117. Write all answers in the boxes in the comic. Then transfer the circled digits, in order, to the circles at the bottom of the comic to solve the Jumble.",4,Jasons Scramble
5,Jasons Scramble,"2. a.  Explain how 0100000 is  related to 64. Hint: The value of the place-value positions in the base-2 numeral system are  shown in the table below. The system is based on powers of 2, and the numbers in base 2 are written using only the digits 0 and 1. ",5,Jasons Scramble

9,Jasons Scramble,"SOLUTIONS 1.  A multiple of 117: 2,808   (24 • 117 = 2,808)   A prime number: 431. Since 143 = 11 • 13, 341 = 11 • 31, 413 = 7 • 59, and all the other numbers are even, 431 is the only prime. The divisibility test for 11 can be applied successfully to 143 and 341, and it should be noted that 413 = 420 – 7 = 7 • (60 – 1) = 7 • 59.",9,Jasons Scramble
10,Jasons Scramble,"2.  a.   0100000 in the base 2, or  binary system, is 32 in the  base 10 system, which is half of 64. Computer scientists use this notation. Using expanded form, 0100000 in base 2 = 0 • 26 + 1 • 25 + 0 • 24 + 0 • 23 + 0 • 22 + 0 • 21 + 0 • 20 = 0 + 32 + 0 + 0 +  0 + 0 + 0, or 32, in base 10. Note that the 1 in 0100000 is in the 32s place, so 0100000 in base 2 = 32 in base 10.    An integer cubed: 4,096 = 163    b.  The 1 is in the 32s place, not the    12 factorial = 12 • 11 • 10 • 9 • 8 • 7 • 6 • 5 • 4 • 3 • 2 • 1 = 479,001,600",10,Jasons Scramble

12,Jasons Scramble,"  b.  110 in base 10 is equal to  1101110 in base 2. To convert 110 in base 10 to a number  in base 2, first find the largest  power of 2 that is less than 110. This largest power of 2 is 64. Divide 110 by 64 and obtain a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 46. Now repeat the process. The largest power of 2 less than 46 is 32; there is one 32 in 46 and a remainder of 14. Continue this process to obtain 1 • 26 + 1 • 25 + 0 • 24 + 1 • 23 + 1 • 22 + 1 • 21 + 0 • 20 = 110, we know that 1101110 in base 2 = 110 in base 10.",12,Jasons Scramble

14,Jasons Scramble,FIELD-TEST COMMENTS,14,Jasons Scramble
15,Jasons Scramble,"This cartoon was given to students as a warm-up before the start of instruction. The problems, although creative, were too challenging for my sixthgrade students. We had studied the least-common multiple but did not cover exponent bases, so it was very confusing for students. If I would offer a suggestion to a teacher, I would say to use it for higher-level sixthgrade students or older. You definitely need to understand the vocabulary to be able to solve the problems.",15,Jasons Scramble

19,Jasons Scramble,"This activity was used with my combined class of eighth-grade Honors Prealgebra and Algebra 1 students in May as an extension of number sense and a review of scientific notation and properties of exponents, which were covered the last two weeks of March. Students worked in small groups of three or four to complete this activity, and they were allowed to use a  TI-Nspire CX handheld device. ",19,Jasons Scramble
20,Jasons Scramble,"My students were immediately  interested in the activity because of the cartoon and the challenge of completing the “puzzle.” However, they wondered why Jason would short himself $32 by writing his $64 check  as 01000002! We had to take a timeout to review the different scenarios when it might be OK to lead a fourdigit number with a 0 and when it would not be OK to do so. ",20,Jasons Scramble

24,Jasons Scramble,"My sixth-grade prealgebra students enjoyed solving Jason’s Jumble. Most had never been exposed to base 2. I circulated, offering suggestions as they made sense and persevered with the base 2 values. One student began teaching his group, and I asked him to come to the board and explain the steps.",24,Jasons Scramble
25,Jasons Scramble,He walked them through the interpretation of base 2 and then demonstrated how to change base 10 back to base 2. Students began to grasp the process. It is always exciting to watch the lightbulbs go on!,25,Jasons Scramble

29,Jasons Scramble,"I tried this activity with thirteen gifted seventh-grade students. They loved the comic, but the content was tougher for them than I had hoped it would be. They said that they had discussed  the binary system in computer class, but never really learned or understood it. I provided a detailed explanation for them, and to assist with the chart provided in number 2, I added a row of base 10 to help them see the relationship. This may help others as well. In regard to the fi nal question, I had many students disagree and say, “There can’t be 24!” They tried to prove me wrong until they made a list themselves. ",29,Jasons Scramble
