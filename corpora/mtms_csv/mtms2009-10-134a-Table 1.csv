"A simple square piece of paper can provide an entry point into a rich problem-solving session. A set of simple origami steps transforms the paper into an open box that can hold mathematical surprises for both students and teachers. An origami lesson can engage students in an open-ended exploration of the relationship between the size of the original paper and the volume of the newly constructed box. The underlying mathematical concepts in this problem include linear measurement, area, volume calculations for rectangular solids, and proportional reasoning. These concepts lead to operations with fractions. ",4,mtms2009-10-134a,,

"Groups of students who worked on this problem relied on their prior knowledge, found a connection to the Pythagorean theorem, and used irrational numbers in their solutions. With guidance, this problem can be made accessible to first-year algebra students; it has also been intriguing to college students and some adult learners. The student work was completed by small groups of preservice elementary teachers who were enrolled in a problem-solving course.  ",15,mtms2009-10-134a,,
"When I presented this problem in my class of future teachers, they were invited to follow along as we each folded a small box from a square of origami paper. (See fig. 1 for the folding instructions.) All students had started with origami paper that was 5.5 inches along each side; the students observed that the resulting three-dimensional box had a fixed volume. Recognizing that the size of the paper and the volume of the box were related, students were then presented with the task of investigating this relationship. ",16,mtms2009-10-134a,,
"To help focus their work, I asked  them to predict the corresponding volume if we had started with a square piece of paper that was 10 inches along each side. They worked in groups to find the volume for the larger box and derive a rule for a general algebraic function that would enable them to predict the output volume (V) when the input variable was the side length of the original square paper (L). Many of these preservice teachers were successful in formulating a correct function rule. ",17,mtms2009-10-134a,,
"When the groups presented their solutions to the class, I was pleased to see both the diversity of approaches and the ownership of ideas by individual student groups. They cared about their answers and were genuinely committed to understanding how the different approaches might connect with each other. ",18,mtms2009-10-134a,,
"After building and unfolding the box, many students observed that the entire piece of paper was covered by smaller squares in a diagonal pattern, with isosceles right triangles around the edges (see fig. 2a). The triangles each had an area that was half of one of the small squares. The net that is outlined on figure 2b shows the bottom and four rectangular sides of the open box as it is positioned on the unfolded paper. The square bottom face covers four of these smaller squares. The rectangular side faces each cover two of the small squares. Most students also observed that the side lengths of each smaller square are equal to 1/8 of the diagonal of the paper. Group A observed that the volume of the resulting box is simply ",19,mtms2009-10-134a,,
"V = l • w • h,  where the dimensions are  and where d is the diagonal length of the square paper.",20,mtms2009-10-134a,,
"The students worked to relate the length of the diagonal back with the side length (L) of the original square paper. Using their knowledge of the Pythagorean theorem, they noted that the hypotenuse of any isosceles right triangle will be ",21,mtms2009-10-134a,,
"Thus, the diagonal of the original square paper will be 12L, where L represents the side length of the square origami paper . The students substituted 12L for the diagonal value in their original formula for the volume in terms of the diagonal to find the correct volume formula, as follows:",22,mtms2009-10-134a,,
"Fig. 2 Unfolding the origami box elicited many observations and revealed the net’s length, width, and height information visually.    (a)                                              (b)",23,mtms2009-10-134a,,

"the box height to find the box length, which was, again, a correct step in the process. However, when they substituted these individual values into their rule for volume  (V = l • w • h),  they made a common mistake. Instead of squaring the length of the box (to multiply length × width), they multiplied the box length by 2 instead. Their individual pieces were correct, but their final volume formula was incorrect. ",26,mtms2009-10-134a,,
"Groups that relied on direct  measurements were limited by their imprecise rulers but were still able to make reasonable estimates. One group measured the height of the final box and found it to be 1 inch, which then led them to use 2 inches, or twice that distance, for the length and width of the box (see fig. 5). They correctly reasoned that increasing the paper size from 5.5 inches to 10 inches would give proportional values (also doubled) for the length, width, and height of the new larger box. Their volume estimate of  1.8 × 3.6 × 3.6 ≈ 23.56 in.3 is reasonably close to the calculated value that they discovered by evaluating the function found by the other groups for volume for side length L = 10 inches.  triangle. They used a lowercase l to represent the paper’s original side length (see fig. 3). ",27,mtms2009-10-134a,,
"A nearly correct solution came  from group C’s discussion. Their work is in figure 4. They determined that the diagonal (hypotenuse) of a square of length  and correctly determined the height of the box to be 1/8 of the diagonal length, as seen by dividing the diagonal in figure 2a. They then doubled ",28,mtms2009-10-134a,,
L denotes the side length of the original square piece of paper. ,29,mtms2009-10-134a,,
Group B used a similar approach  with the diagonal by remembering the Pythagorean theorem. The drawing of the triangle shows students’ knowledge of the hypotenuse-toleg relationship for any 45°-45°-90° ,30,mtms2009-10-134a,,

"showed their mathematical thinking in relating linear, area, and volume measurements. Further, they grappled with proportional reasoning as they made sense of how changing the paper size affected other measurements. Their discussions of possible rules  for the side length-volume relationship allowed some groups to review their knowledge of right triangles and the Pythagorean theorem. Another important aspect of their work was the manipulation of functional rules that included the value of 12 and related irrational values. Note that the written work of the college students shows a high degree of comfort in manipulating irrational numbers; middle school students who successfully find a function rule will likely use decimals to express their calculated values for the volume. This practice might lead to a helpful discussion of appropriate rounding techniques.",32,mtms2009-10-134a,,
The importance of proportional  reasoning should also be emphasized. Most students need to observe many applications to deepen their ,33,mtms2009-10-134a,,
"The initial height measurement of 1 inch corresponds closely to the value of 0.9723 inches, which has been rounded, and can be calculated from the earlier rule for 1/8 of the diagonal value found by groups A and B.",34,mtms2009-10-134a,,

The final fold lines divide the original square piece of paper into 24 small squares and 16 triangles that are half squares, or 24 + 8 = 32 small squares. each square will thus have an area that is 1/32 of the paper, or 1/32 of L2.

They need to realize that the dimensions of the constructed box are all onedimensional numerical values (or linear), just as the original square’s side length is one dimensional. When the original size of the square increases (or decreases), the lengths of all the one-dimensional fold lines will change proportionally. ",44,mtms2009-10-134a,,
"Middle school students would benefit from folding boxes of three different sizes, and allowing them to physically handle several examples. They will then be more likely to articulate how increasing or decreasing the size of the original square will change the length, width, and height of the resulting box. Middle school  students might make two significant realizations: 1.  The base of the box appears to  always be a square.  2.  The value for the height of the box  appears to always be half the side length of the square base. ",45,mtms2009-10-134a,,

"Discussing the table values should reinforce the one-half relationship discussed, namely, that height is 1/2 of the length.
