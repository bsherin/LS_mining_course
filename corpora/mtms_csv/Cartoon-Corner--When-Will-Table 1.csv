The personal trainer problems provided excellent practice in substituting values for variables. The only point of confusion was  the height. Many students did not pay attention to the fact that the height had to be calculated using inches.

When they recalled that they were shrinking it, they realized that they should not be multiplying by 6.21 and then they correctly recalculated the scale factor by dividing 330 by 2048 to obtain 0.16. Some students then used that scale factor and multiplied by 1536 to get 245 pixels. Others set up a proportion and arrived at approximately 248 pixels.",28,Cartoon Corner: When Will I Ever Use Math?

32,Cartoon Corner: When Will I Ever Use Math?,"I used this cartoon and questions with a mixed class of sixth and seventh graders who performed below a satisfactory level on last year’s state tests. Problem 1 elicited a nice discussion on heights, particularly about converting from feet and inches to inches. The class also conjectured about how the formulas would change if students used feet instead of inches. The second question gave students the most trouble because they could not visualize the page, so I showed them a printed brochure as an example of a page with columns. Many of the students figured out that the scale factors 6.21 and 0.1611 are reciprocals. ",32,Cartoon Corner: When Will I Ever Use Math?
33,Cartoon Corner: When Will I Ever Use Math?,"Two guest speakers who showed my students how they use math in their jobs delivered two of the most  beneficial lessons my students have experienced. One speaker, a banker, gave an overview of finances and told the class that “success doesn’t happen unplanned.” This statement opened up very interesting class discussions about high school choice and college readiness. The other guest was a civil engineer who made it clear that “engineers are problem solvers, but on a big scale”; the training for that career has already started for my students.
