The combined seventh-grade and eighth-grade class began each day with a mathematical reasoning question as a warm-up activity. One day’s question was this: ,2,mtms2012-04-494a,,
Is the product of two odd numbers always an odd number?,3,mtms2012-04-494a,,
Students took sides on the issue. ,4,mtms2012-04-494a,,
"One said, “Every one I tried ended in an odd number, so maybe it works.” Another immediately disagreed and said, “The only way to know for certain is to try every possible combination.” Other class members picked sides without explaining their decision. In the end, students simply asked the teacher to tell them the answer. When he refused, the topic ",5,mtms2012-04-494a,,

"Proof was shelved, and the class moved to the planned lesson. ",13,mtms2012-04-494a,,
"The teacher later reﬂ ected on  the frustration caused by the warmup activity. The question of parity (“even-ness” or “odd-ness”) of the product of two odd numbers relates to a basic axiom of the number system, specifi cally, the closure property of multiplication. Early in the year, the class studied basic axioms— commutative, associative, identity, inverse, closure, and distributive properties. Students identifi ed computational uses for most properties but were unable to fi nd applications for the closure properties of addition and multiplication. They agreed that every addition or multiplication problem had a single answer, but  they were unable to state how the properties aided work when completing computations or while problem solving. They concluded that the closure properties were necessary in the number system but were not useful for computation.",14,mtms2012-04-494a,,
"The teacher recalled his dissatisfaction with the conclusion that closure properties “were not useful.” Students’ diffi culties with the warmup question stirred up this earlier displeasure. To address these issues, he decided to create three days of activities, forming a mini unit exploring the closure property. When designing the activities, he kept in mind that his twenty-four students had various levels of ability but were experienced with classroom discourse. ",15,mtms2012-04-494a,,
The series of activities was also an  opportunity for students to determine what was considered a valid proof and to become familiar with some categories of proof. This introduction to proof started students on a path of reasoning. Students will be required to reason in this way in later grades when they work with more analytical proofs. These activities were steps in the process of teaching toward proof.,16,mtms2012-04-494a,,
day 1: writing hyPotheses and exhaustive Proofs,17,mtms2012-04-494a,,
"The fi rst task was to generalize closure beyond the basic addition and multiplication properties.  •  The closure property of addition: If both a and b are elements of the real numbers, then a + b is a unique element of the real numbers.",18,mtms2012-04-494a,,
"•  The closure property of multiplica- tion: If both a and b are elements of the real numbers, then a × b is a unique element of the real numbers.",19,mtms2012-04-494a,,
"The teacher then suggested that closure might apply to any set with any operation. Providing an example, he then posed the question, “Is the set of whole numbers closed under addition?” Students did not know what was meant by the question, which provided an opportunity to determine the difference between a question and a hypothesis. ",20,mtms2012-04-494a,,
"The students needed to understand the question “Are the whole numbers closed under addition?” and frame it as a hypothesis that could be proved or disproved. The teacher stated, ",21,mtms2012-04-494a,,
"Questions in everyday language are answered by facts, guesses, opinions, or even ignored; however, a hypothesis is a statement to be proved or disproved by facts. Once a hypothesis is proved or disproved, the answer to the question becomes obvious.",22,mtms2012-04-494a,,
Students identiﬁ ed computational uses for most properties but were unable to ﬁ nd applications for the closure properties of addition and multiplication. ,23,mtms2012-04-494a,,
"The class tried to write a hypothesis for the question. After some hesitation and additional discussion, the teacher offered this formal mathematical question: “Are the whole numbers closed under addition?” He then translated the question: “Is the sum of any two whole numbers always a whole number?” ",24,mtms2012-04-494a,,
"The students accepted the translation and wrote their hypothesis: “The sum of any two whole numbers is a whole number.” They unanimously agreed that their hypothesis was true but disagreed on whether they could prove it. Several pointed out that no one could fi nd an example to disprove the hypothesis. Others countered that since they could not check all the possibilities, they could not prove it. With the class at an impasse, the teacher suggested they start with a simpler question and return to this hypothesis later.",25,mtms2012-04-494a,,
"The teacher suggested using a fi nite set as a simpler problem. He asked if the set {0, 1} is closed under multiplication. The students translated this question to become the hypothesis “The product of any combination of 0 and 1 is always 0 or 1.”",26,mtms2012-04-494a,,
The students tested the set’s four  possible multiplication problems: •  0 × 0 = 0 •  0 × 1 = 0 •  1 × 0 = 0 •  1 × 1 = 1,27,mtms2012-04-494a,,
"Since all possible multiplication problems from the set resulted in answers from the set, they concluded that they had proved that {0, 1} was closed under multiplication. ",28,mtms2012-04-494a,,
"The next example of an exhaustive closure proof was tried with the same set, {0, 1}, under addition. Again, students identifi ed and completed the four possible addition problems from the set:  •  0 + 0 = 0 •  0 + 1 = 1 •  1 + 0 = 1 •  1 + 1 = 2 ",29,mtms2012-04-494a,,
"They immediately noticed that the last problem’s answer was not in the set. Since a counterexample was found, the class determined that the set was not closed under addition.",30,mtms2012-04-494a,,
"These two tasks showed the primary characteristic of an exhaustive proof: Every possible example must be examined to see if it fi ts the criterion. Using the {0, 1} set was a simple task; using larger sets makes exhaustive proofs more diffi cult.",31,mtms2012-04-494a,,
"The next challenge tested the set {-1, 0, 1} under multiplication. The class realized that nine possibilities were to be tested; however, they quickly identifi ed only eight. The student who identifi ed the missing problem made a table listing all possibilities (see table 1a). Another said, “In addition to organizing the possibilities, the table provides a place to record and check answers.” The class used the table for this problem and resolved to make similar tables for future problems. After fi lling out the table and verifying that all results were elements of the set, they concluded that {–1, 0, 1} was closed under multiplication. ",32,mtms2012-04-494a,,
"To discover if the same set was closed under addition, they created another table (see table 1b). They stopped immediately when they put a -2 in the first cell of the table. After identifying this counterexample, the class concluded that {-1, 0, 1} was not closed under addition.",33,mtms2012-04-494a,,
"The class tested two other sets— {0, 1, 2} and {0, 1, 2, 3}—for closure under both multiplication and addition. They found that neither set was closed under either operation. The first day’s exploration ended with students noting, “Closed sets are not common.” day 2 : exhaustive Proofs for infinite sets",34,mtms2012-04-494a,,
"The next day’s question, “Is the set of even numbers closed under addition?” was different from earlier questions because the set under consideration was infinite. Students could not check every possible sum of two even numbers. ",35,mtms2012-04-494a,,
"The class tried to define even  numbers: “They are every other whole number starting from 0” and “They’re divisible by 2.” These statements were not considered helpful. Then a student stated that even numbers ended in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8. At that point, the teacher focused the discussion by asking, “What do you mean ‘ending in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8’? Does 1.8 work?” The class then refined the statement in this way: “Even numbers are whole numbers that have a 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 in the units position.”",36,mtms2012-04-494a,,
"After considering the numerals in other place value positions, the class quickly agreed that all preceding place-value positions were irrelevant to being an even number. Since the units digit was the only digit in a whole number to impact a number’s parity, all preceding digits could safely  table 1 These tables helped students test for closure under multiplication (a) and under addition (b).  –1 –1 –1 –1    (a)    (b) table 2 These tables helped students determine the closure of even numbers under addition (a) and multiplication (b).",37,mtms2012-04-494a,,
"(a) (b) be ignored. When any two even numbers were added, only five units digits were possible for each number, resulting in twenty-five possible combinations of units digits from any pair of even numbers. The class constructed  a chart showing all possible combinations (see table 2a). ",38,mtms2012-04-494a,,
"As the class filled in the chart, they  noticed two different responses for  6 + 4: Some had written “10,” whereas others had written “0.” One student  table 3 This table helped students determine if any two odd numbers summed to an even number.",39,mtms2012-04-494a,,
table 4 Students used this table to determine if the odd numbers were closed under multiplication.,40,mtms2012-04-494a,,
"argued that the only digit that mattered with even numbers was the units digit, so they needed to write only the units digit in the table. The class agreed and modified the chart.",41,mtms2012-04-494a,,
"The teacher confirmed that the  class believed that even numbers are closed under addition. Next, the teacher asked if they had proved that belief. The class was uncertain until one student pointed out that they had made a chart of all possibilities, tested them, and all worked; therefore, everyone should be as confident of this proof as they were when they tested all possibilities from finite sets. This statement improved student confidence in the proof. The teacher stated that “types of possibilities” were called classes of problems. By testing all possible classes of problems, students had completed a proof.",42,mtms2012-04-494a,,
"Students were asked how to determine if even numbers were closed under multiplication. The response was to change the chart to multiplication (see table 2b) and test the same twenty-five classes of problems. All answers ended in even numbers, so everyone agreed that a proof was completed for this hypothesis.",43,mtms2012-04-494a,,
"One student wondered aloud if odd numbers were closed under addition. Some students began making a new table containing odd numbers. Others found counterexamples. After letting the class work, the teacher prompted them for conclusions. With multiple counterexamples, such as  1 + 3 = 4, 7 + 5 = 12, and 3 + 5 = 8, the class agreed that odd numbers were not closed under addition. Then a student asked if two odd numbers always summed to an even. The teacher stated that this question was not technically about closure, but  similar reasoning might lead to an answer.",44,mtms2012-04-494a,,
"At this point, the students who  had modified table 2a for addition of odd numbers stated that their chart (see table 3) would be useful. The students filled in the chart and found that all classes of an odd number plus an odd number resulted in an even sum. As soon as the chart was filled, everyone agreed that they had proved that two odds always add to an even.",45,mtms2012-04-494a,,
"Students and teacher concurred that the next challenge was testing the odd numbers for closure under multiplication. When no counterexample was identified, a new chart was created to test the hypothesis (see table 4). Since all classes of odd-number combinations result in a product with an odd units digit, they concluded that they had proved that odd numbers were closed under multiplication.",46,mtms2012-04-494a,,
"The day ended with students  recognizing that infinite sets might be grouped into a finite number of categories called classes. By testing all classes, an exhaustive proof could be attempted.  day 3: new sets,  new oPerations",47,mtms2012-04-494a,,
"The third day’s exploration tested closure with new operations and new sets. For each new question, students were asked to write the hypothesis, their belief about the hypothesis, and then vote as a class on their belief. Each student recorded this information in the belief and proof table (see table 5).",48,mtms2012-04-494a,,
"The students recorded differing opinions for the first hypothesis of “The whole numbers are closed under subtraction.” One student believed it was true and said, “If you subtract any two whole numbers, you’ll never get a part of a whole number [fraction or decimal] left over. The answer has to be a whole number.” Another student countered, “3 – 5 = -2, and -2 isn’t  table 5 A belief and proof table helped students organize their thoughts as many hypotheses were posed to the class.",49,mtms2012-04-494a,,
hypothesis do you Believe the  hypothesis? does the class Believe  the hypothesis? is the hypothesis ,50,mtms2012-04-494a,,
Proved true? is the hypothesis ,51,mtms2012-04-494a,,
"Proved false? a whole number.” This was rebutted by “-2 doesn’t have any fraction or decimal part, so it is a whole number.” Some agreed and some disagreed with this comment. ",52,mtms2012-04-494a,,
"The teacher took this opportunity  to review set definitions, including natural numbers, whole numbers, integers, rational numbers, and real numbers. After the impromptu review, he asked, “With the definitions given, are the whole numbers closed under subtraction?” The class agreed that 3 – 5 = -2 provided a counterexample. When asked to communicate the idea mathematically, the class stated, “Whole numbers are not closed under subtraction.” ",53,mtms2012-04-494a,,
"The teacher then asked if there  was a set that was closed under subtraction. A student suggested that integers might work since “negative whole numbers are included.” This became the next hypothesis and led to more disagreement. The argument was made that taking away “whole” amounts from “whole” amounts would not leave any “nonwhole” pieces. The class agreed that this was convincing but some did not think it was a proof. One stated, “We can’t check all of the numbers, so maybe there is one that will leave a fractional part.” ",54,mtms2012-04-494a,,
"A class vote showed that every  student believed integers were closed under subtraction, but only two-thirds believed the hypothesis was proved. The class was at an impasse, so the  teacher decided to table the discussion and return to this question later.",55,mtms2012-04-494a,,
"A new operation, digit reversal,  defined as rewriting the number with the numerals in opposite order, was then presented. Examples of digit reversal were given: 527 became 725, 13 became 31, 8 became 8, 64 became 46, and 297,654 became 456,792. Students were asked, “Are even  numbers closed under digit reversal?” One student noted the examples above always started and ended with the same type of digit, even or odd. He suggested that they needed to try a number that began with an odd digit and ended with an even digit, such as 34. After digit reversal, it became 43, an odd number. This counterexample proved the hypothesis false, a fact acknowledged by the entire class.",56,mtms2012-04-494a,,
"Another student stated the class  had also proved that the odd numbers were not closed under digit reversal. She said the same example in reverse was a counterexample for the odd numbers, since 43 reversed to become 34. Again, everyone agreed. ",57,mtms2012-04-494a,,
"At this point, one student noted that they always agreed when a hypothesis was false, but had difficulty agreeing with arguments for proving a hypothesis true. Another added, “It’s easier to find one example that doesn’t work than to prove every possible example in the universe will work.” ",58,mtms2012-04-494a,,
"The teacher next asked if multiples of 3 were closed under digit  reversal. After recording their beliefs on the activity sheet, the class found that the majority did not believe the hypothesis was true. The class noted this question was more difficult, since multiples of 3 did not follow patterns, such as with 2, 5, or 10. “Multiples of 3 can end with anything!”",59,mtms2012-04-494a,,
"The teacher asked if anyone had  ideas about how to continue with this hypothesis. Since there were none, the class divided into groups to consider two questions proposed by the teacher: 1.  Does being a multiple of 3 always  mean that a number is divisible  by 3? 2.  How do you know a number is  divisible by 3?",60,mtms2012-04-494a,,
"One group remembered the divisibility rule for 3: The sum of the digits must be a multiple of 3. After discussing this fact, two groups announced they could prove the hypothesis, and one group presented this argument:",61,mtms2012-04-494a,,
"If a number is divisible by 3, then its digits add to some multiple of 3. Reversing the digits of the original number does not change the sum of its digits, so the reversed digits will add to the same multiple of 3. So every multiple of 3 will generate a multiple of 3 when its digits are reversed. Therefore, multiples of 3 are closed under digit reversal.",62,mtms2012-04-494a,,
"The teacher asked if the argument was a proof. The argument was convincing, the statements were true, and the steps were valid. After examining the argument’s written statements, the class agreed that the argument was indeed a proof of the hypothesis.",63,mtms2012-04-494a,,
"This example ended the set of  planned activities; however, the class still disagreed on two hypotheses:  1.  The set of whole numbers is closed  under addition.  2.  Integers are closed under subtrac- tion. ",64,mtms2012-04-494a,,
"The teacher consulted a mathematics professor at a local university to ask if the arguments made by the class about these conjectures would be considered proofs. The professor indicated that whether the class had a proof depended on their defi nitions of the sets and operations. Because middle school students used defi nitions that were operational in nature, the arguments could be considered proofs. Mathematicians would use different defi nitions but similar reasoning. After the teacher brought this news to the class, everyone agreed that their arguments were proofs.",65,mtms2012-04-494a,,
conclusions,66,mtms2012-04-494a,,
"In addition to teaching proof techniques, the activities described were designed to examine the students’ conceptions about reasoning and proof, as found in Harel and Sowder’s (1998) organization of students’ proof schemes. Since the seventh-grade and eighth-grade students had differing experiences with reasoning and proof, the activities gave the teacher insight on whether the students were operating with empirical proof schemes from Harel and Sowder’s classifi cation system. Empirical proof schemes are based on “physical facts or sensory experience” (p. 252). These schemes may lead to erroneous conclusions if all the ",67,mtms2012-04-494a,,

applicable facts or experiences are not considered when “proving” a hypothesis. The empirical schemes are more affected by example-based reasoning than analytical proof schemes that are based on “logical deductions” (p. 258).,69,mtms2012-04-494a,,
"In the original warm-up activity,  some students demonstrated a specifi c type of empirical proof scheme, the inductive proof scheme, by stating that a limited number of examples convinced them that the odd numbers were closed under multiplication. These students used example-based reasoning to confi rm their belief that the hypothesis was true. They needed to recognize that applying inductive proof schemes results in proofs only when all possible examples are tested. Because they tested a nonexhaustive set of examples, their reasoning, although suffi cient to convince themselves, did not constitute a proof.",70,mtms2012-04-494a,,
"During the second day’s activities, some students demonstrated a type of analytical proof scheme, the transformational proof scheme. The students were led to this scheme by the questioning strategy during the discussion on how all even numbers could be transformed into fi ve classes. ",71,mtms2012-04-494a,,
"The same scheme was then applied to classify the odd numbers into a fi nite number of categories, since the students could anticipate and build on the results of the classifi cation. ",72,mtms2012-04-494a,,
"The fi nal activity of the third  day, the closure of multiples of three under digit reversal, demonstrated some students’ independent use of the transformational proof scheme. Although it was apparent that not all the students were capable of generating the proof individually, the activity provided both practice in analytical proof schemes and exposure to peers’ reasoning at that level. ",73,mtms2012-04-494a,,
"For these students, the three days’  activities offered multiple opportunities to recognize the difference between belief and proof. The teacher repeatedly emphasized that although students might convince themselves based on inductive reasoning with limited examples, such reasoning does not constitute proof. Although these activities, by themselves, may not be suffi cient to eliminate all vestiges of erroneously applied empirical proof schemes, they do provide some of the experience necessary to develop appropriate proof techniques.  reference",74,mtms2012-04-494a,,
