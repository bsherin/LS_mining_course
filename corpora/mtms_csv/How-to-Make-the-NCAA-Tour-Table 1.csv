2,How to Make the NCAA Tourney - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The RPI measures the difficulty of a team's schedule and how that team fared against that schedule. The RPI is found by a weighted sum of the WP (a team's winning percentage), the OWP (the opponent's average winning percentage), and the OOWP (the opponent's opponents' average winning percentage):",,
3,How to Make the NCAA Tourney - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,RPI = .25 (WP) + .50 (OWP) + .25 (OOWP),,
4,How to Make the NCAA Tourney - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The SOS is the measure of a team's strength of schedule, which is found through this calculation: SOS = 2/3(OWP) + 1/3(OOWP)",,
