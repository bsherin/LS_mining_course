"The Connection Standard in Principles and Standards for School Mathematics (NCTM 2000) emphasizes the importance of interdisciplinary experiences in the teaching and development of mathematical ideas. This article describes a four-week summer enrichment program relating mathematics to real-life applications in architecture and design, produced by the faculty from Kean University (through an Improving Teacher Quality Partnership grant awarded by the state of New Jersey). The focus of this summer program was to provide  both a professional development opportunity for teachers and preservice teachers from the university as well as an opportunity for accelerated learners to have authentic hands-on experience in the critical content areas of data analysis, measurement, and proportionality. The students selected were rising sixth and seventh graders from an urban New Jersey school district.",3,mtms2008-03-382a,,
"The opportunity to integrate  mathematics and architecture grew out of the fact that the school district was in the early planning stages of designing a new state-of-the-art middle  school to alleviate overcrowding in the current schools. This project-based learning experience, which addressed New Jersey Core Curriculum Content Standards in mathematics, language arts, science, and technology, offered the university faculty the opportunity to carry out Kean’s yearlong initiative to embed the project-based learning paradigm into teaching. As summarized by Markham, Larmer, and Ravitz (2003), “For over 100 years, educators such as John Dewey have reported on the benefits of experiential, hands-on, student-directed learning”  suzanne l. Reynolds, suzreynolds@comcast.net, is an associate professor of mathematics education at St. Thomas Aquinas College in Sparkill, New York. Her interests include professional development for teachers and the development of mathematical reasoning in students, including preservice teachers.  Michael Mahan, mahanmic@mail.armstrong.edu, is an assistant professor of science education and head of the Department of Middle and Secondary Education at Armstrong Atlantic State University, Savannah, Georgia. His interests include the design of middle school science curricula; the study of teacher stress; and contemporary social issues, such as the debate of evolution versus creationism. Barbara lee, blee@kean.edu, is an assistant professor of special education and coordinator of the undergraduate program at Kean University in Union, New Jersey. She is interested technology in teacher education and faculty development. gilda delRisco, gdelrisc@kean.edu, is an assistant professor of bilingual/ESL education and coordinator of the undergraduate and graduate programs in bilingual education at Kean University in Union, New Jersey. She is interested in language acquisition through content areas and the professional development of teachers.",4,mtms2008-03-382a,,

"Before involving the district’s middle school students, it was necessary to provide a week of professional development workshops for teachers and preservice teachers in the areas of gifted and talented education (including bilingual gifted and talented education), problem-based learning, and technology. Project-based learning was a natural approach to the task of designing the middle school because it provided an authentic end result. Students were introduced to experiences that naturally occurred outside the classroom. From their initial involvement, the students exhibited motivation not often experienced by those attending summer school. This authentic problem approach had a culminating-event component that gave students a chance to present and exhibit their work to district personnel, architectural consultants, university faculty, and program participants.",7,mtms2008-03-382a,,
"The gifted and talented workshop  emphasized teaching strategies for accelerated learners that included questioning techniques, tiered assignments, and curriculum compacting, as well as project-based and cooperative learning. Teachers participated in a sample lesson that involved creating a scaled drawing.",8,mtms2008-03-382a,,
"Since approximately 25 percent of  the students enrolled in this school district were classified as English Language Learners (ELLs), the bilingual workshop introduced specific teaching strategies appropriate for these students. Because mathematics has terminology that may be difficult for ELLs, new terms needed to be explained through concrete and  meaningful experiences. Project-based learning provided the opportunity for the students to express and exchange ideas in a nonthreatening environment, which is essential for language acquisition and content learning.",9,mtms2008-03-382a,,
"The teachers performed several of  the major measuring tasks that the students would be working on during the following week. Some teachers expressed apprehension about their own measuring skills and admitted to having had little experience finding areas and volumes. These concerns were evident when the teachers had a group discussion to review their calculations. The tasks of calculating the area of the building lot and the volume of the classroom resulted in significant discrepancies among answers, leading to a rich discussion on probable difficulties and sources of error that students might encounter. Teachers demonstrated different measuring techniques. Small errors that occurred because of inaccurate measurement were compounded by the multiplication that was needed to calculate volume and area. As stated in Principles and Standards, experiences in measuring directly strengthen understanding of the area of two- dimensional shapes and the volume  of three-dimensional shapes.",10,mtms2008-03-382a,,
"This project, based on a high  school unit that was supported by the George Lucus Educational Foundation, required the students to complete seven products: an analysis of collected data, a site plan, an environmental impact statement, an isometric drawing, a scale model of the classroom, a cost estimate, and an oral presentation. Students worked in small groups of five to six, along with a teacher and at least one student intern. The student interns included mathematics and science preservice teachers as well as two design majors from the university. In addition, two interns from an architectural firm ",11,mtms2008-03-382a,,

"Initially, participants were randomly placed in groups so that the students from both of the city’s middle schools would be working together. Many students did not know one another and, as a way to create a feeling of community, we used the game of Set as an icebreaker. This card game of visual processing requires student teams to identify triplets of color, shape, or patterns. The game of Set became so popular that students would come to school early to play and would also ask to play during lunch. During the second week, students were placed into groups based on the particular school space that they were interested in designing, such as the auditorium, cafeteria, recreational area, library, and math/science classrooms.  an analYsis oF  collected data",13,mtms2008-03-382a,,
"The first activity for this project required collecting data, which was completed through a survey. Work on the survey began in June before school was dismissed for the summer. Since the students and teachers who would  be participating in this project had not yet been identified, a preservice intern designed a survey eliciting input from both students and teachers as to what factors they felt were most important in the design of a new school for their city. Specific survey information sought feedback regarding how participants would change their existing school. The survey continued by asking the participants to rank, in order of importance, these three areas: the exterior of the school, the interior common areas, and the classrooms. Specifically, the exterior included the parking lot, recreation areas, and location of the school. For the interior, the participants ranked classroom size, safety, and the gymnasium. Other aspects considered were Internet access, furniture, and how well the classrooms could be used for different functions. ",14,mtms2008-03-382a,,
"On the first day of the summer  program, students constructed graphical representations of the data, examined the results, and prepared oral presentations of the results (see fig. 1). As emphasized as being important in Principles and Standards, the elements of explaining, questioning, and making sense of mathematics through communication were key aspects of this ",15,mtms2008-03-382a,,

"lawn area were different from those recorded from the pavement surface. The third method that the students used was the trundle wheel (see fig. 3). Despite never having used a trundle wheel as a measurement device, students discovered through its use how important it was to verify their results. Team members carefully checked and rechecked their measurements and analyzed the discrepancies; once students were convinced of their measurement accuracy, they drew and labeled the site plans. ",18,mtms2008-03-382a,,
"By dividing the lot into smaller units, the students were able to find the area of the separate component parts; they then added the pieces to  posed challenges for the students (as it had for the teachers and interns the week before). Students were encouraged to use at least three methods for their measurement and to compare their results. In addition to using a tape measure, they employed the technique of measuring their stride and pacing off the area. Discrepancies in the results led students to discover that their strides recorded from the  program. One important aspect that emerged from these data was that the students felt a sense of community and wanted the building to enhance this sense. For example, the students decided that the facilities should be available for community activities and that city residents should be able to use some areas, such as the recreational area, when school was not in session. Also, the students felt that it was very important for the school to have an auditorium so that they would be able to meet together in one common area (one of the current middle schools did not have an auditorium).  site Plan",19,mtms2008-03-382a,,
"The second product was a site plan, drawn to scale, of the building and lot where the program was being held (see fig. 2). After examining site plans of other schools that were supplied by an architectural firm, all groups agreed on the scale of 1 inch = 20 feet that they would use for their own drawings. Both the lot and the building were irregular shapes, which  find the total square footage of the lot, the building, and the parking area. They also calculated the percentages of the total lot area that were occupied by the building, the parking area, and the lawn.  enviRonMental iMPact stateMent",20,mtms2008-03-382a,,
The third required product was an environmental impact statement (see fig. 4). Students went on a field trip to a newly opened elementary school in ,21,mtms2008-03-382a,,
"Fig. 4 The students’ environmental statement i think that if we were going to build a school in the near future that we have to look at all the possibilities and environmental risks. There has to be limits and restrictions of what and where a school is built. one example would be not to build the school near any factories because then everyone would get sick and be breathing bad air. Make sure that the school is built on ground that isn’t affected by water run off or too close to lakes, ponds, or any other source of water. Students later could get ideas of going into water so it’s not a good idea. Also it’s a good idea if the school is made of a good component. Not a structure that could collapse in the future. Not using trees because it’s not so strong and it will be helping the environment. Make sure that there are trees for recreation because not all of it needs to go down. it could also be for a good use while helping the environment. it is also a good idea if it is not built near major highways because by not building it near highways you’re lowering danger probabilities and not doing any more construction on roads which means trees coming down.",22,mtms2008-03-382a,,
These are all environmental risks needed if a school is going to take place. All of this has to come into consideration when building a school of such magnitude. one other example would be for correct measurements to take place. What if you’re building the school in a grassy place and you need to cut trees? You don’t want to cut too many trees. That would be bad. So these would be some of the environmental risks needed to consider if we were to build a school.,23,mtms2008-03-382a,,
Fig. 5 The lack of difficulty students exhibited producing the isometric drawing surprised the teachers.,24,mtms2008-03-382a,,
"a nearby urban area and used information from that visit to help them prepare their statements. They also researched the Internet for components that should be included in such a statement. Some factors they added included the immediate need for a new school because of severe crowding in the present schools, concern over the possible displacement of homes and businesses, the effect of increased taxes on the community, and the impact of the school on natural resources.  isoMetRic dRawing",25,mtms2008-03-382a,,
"The fourth task, as requested by the district supervisor of mathematics, was the isometric drawing of a structure composed of 1-inch cubes (see fig. 5). This exercise was supposed to be included in the regular school curriculum but was frequently neglected because of time constraints. The teachers had predicted that this task would be difficult for the students but they were proved wrong. Some students not only completed the drawings but also added windows, doors, landscaping, and other attributes as if they were drawing a particular school.",26,mtms2008-03-382a,,

"measure and build a scale model of the classroom in which they were working (see fig. 6). It was agreed ahead of time that all the groups would use the scale of 1 inch = 4 feet. Students had to measure all windows, doors, closets, desks, and so on to complete the model. They also calculated the area of the floor, area of the walls, volume of the room, and the square-feet-tostudent ratio based on how many desks were in the classroom. This ratio was compared with figures obtained from other schools through consultation with the architectural interns.",30,mtms2008-03-382a,,
cost estiMate,31,mtms2008-03-382a,,
"The sixth product was the completion of a cost estimate worksheet (see  fig. 7). Students calculated the total costs for constructing a school, including leveling the ground, constructing a parking lot, and constructing athletic fields. The prices per square foot were obtained through the George Lucas Educational Foundation Web site (see Armstrong 2007), consultations with a local architectural firm, and from the Web site of the National Clearinghouse for Educational Facilities (National Institute of Building Sciences 2007). This activity enabled the students to get a realistic sense of the huge costs required to construct a new school.",32,mtms2008-03-382a,,
"All students were required to research the accessible elements specified in the Americans with Disabilities Act (2000) to meet mandated construction of doorways, ramps, and bathrooms. The design of handicapped ramps led to discussions on slope. In particular, the group that was working on the auditorium design became engrossed in the mathematical specifics related to a stage ramp and the general slope of the floor to enhance visibility, which developed in them a good sense of rise over run. The outcome was just as stated in Principles and Standards: “The understanding of proportionality should also emerge through problem solving and reason-",33,mtms2008-03-382a,,

"The final task embodied some of the most critical elements of good project-based learning: doing what people do in their daily work while connecting the project to a local issue and performing community service. On the last day of the program, the students, district administrators, and faculty assembled to view the finished  models and to hear the student presentations (see fig. 8). The students were extremely proud of their work. Each group explained why design decisions had been made and how they arrived at their calculations, then they answered questions from the audience. Overall, the student designs incorporated many nontraditional ideas, such as adding a waterfall in the library to promote calmness and placing circular walls in several rooms to be “outside the box.” For example, the cafeteria was designed as a round room with round tables, which ",36,mtms2008-03-382a,,

necessitated that the students do extensive work with the formulas for circles as well as rectangles (see fig. 9). One architectural intern remarked that she was amazed at the creative ideas that the students discussed and would like to implement some of those ideas in her own designs.  outcoMes,39,mtms2008-03-382a,,
"Teachers, interns and students were required to keep reflective journals. Prompts were supplied by a university faculty member. We found that many of the journal entries were more descriptive, rather than reflective, and this result will be an issue for future projects. Here is a sampling from teacher journals:",40,mtms2008-03-382a,,
"I would definitely say that the week of teacher orientation was definitely a learning experience. Measuring the strides, using the “wheel,” and reading of blueprints and floor plans were all learning experiences. If someone were to  tell me that I would know how to scale a room or building, create floor plans, and read blueprints, I would not have believed them. I know that this program was designed for the students but I definitely have attained more than what I came into the program.",41,mtms2008-03-382a,,
"To my surprise, once they identified the error, they [the students] immediately created an action plan. One of the students replied, “We have to correct the data first, then make the changes to the model.” Wow! I thought they collaborated like a group of miniature adults—reviewing each other’s calculations and providing support to one another when needed.",42,mtms2008-03-382a,,
"Very rarely did we need to step in and show them the right way to convert or add something. Each time that it seemed necessary, one of the other students would jump in and take the reins, which was nice to see. The group works very well together, taking turns in taking charge or going with someone’s idea.",43,mtms2008-03-382a,,
"Great teamwork was exemplified. Each of the six students calculated the prescribed measurements and nothing was recorded until they each had the same answer. When there was a discrepancy, they worked through until each reached the same conclusion.",44,mtms2008-03-382a,,
Here is a sampling from the students’ journals:,45,mtms2008-03-382a,,
The biggest challenge I faced was meeting new people and trying to make new friends. How I overcame it was talking to people in conversations. ,46,mtms2008-03-382a,,
I think our team works good together. We need to have more conversations and some people need to contribute more.,47,mtms2008-03-382a,,
It was fun working in groups because you got to see what other people were thinking. Also you got more ideas to help with the project.,48,mtms2008-03-382a,,
The biggest challenge this week was measuring the ramp and we couldn’t put it together. We overcame it by measuring it over again. The activity that I am most proud of accomplishing is the model of the classroom because the whole group worked together and we got the model done and we got a lot of compliments on it.  coMMents,49,mtms2008-03-382a,,
"One of our original ideas was that this program would allow students to develop their skills using metric measurement. Much to our surprise, we learned that architects in the United States do not use the metric system. Since all the designs and site plans loaned to us from the architectural firm were in the English system of measure, we decided not to work with metric measurement. ",50,mtms2008-03-382a,,
"We introduced the design software SketchUp, which allowed students to construct three-dimensional designs  by computer. Time and computer restrictions were limiting factors to its use, but students did have the opportunity to use the technology similar to what architects would use. Another opportunity to incorporate technology would have been to compare site images from GoogleEarth.com to the site plans drawn by students.",51,mtms2008-03-382a,,
"This article describes the process of  creating and implementing a projectbased learning experience that integrates mathematics with architecture and design. Despite the challenges of such an undertaking, both teachers and students alike felt it was an extremely valuable learning experience.",52,mtms2008-03-382a,,
