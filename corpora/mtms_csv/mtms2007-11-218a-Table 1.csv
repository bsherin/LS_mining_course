"The Editorial Panel is presenting the following problem to stimulate submissions to “The Thinking of Students” department. We encourage teachers to try this problem with students and analyze the different ways that students solve it. Feel free to photocopy this problem for use in your classroom. Please send the following if students generate unique strategies:  •  A brief analysis of the   specific strategy •  Examples of students’ work •   Your name, the school name and address, and    your e-mail address",2,mtms2007-11-218a,,

Find the sum of all positive six-digit integers whose digits are a permutation of the digits in the number 123456 without listing them all.,5,mtms2007-11-218a,,
"of all the digits in the ones place is 120(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6) = 2,520. The sum of all the numbers can be found by using this information:  2,520(100,000 + 10,000 + 1,000 +  100 + 10 + 1) = 279,999,720",6,mtms2007-11-218a,,
Method 3,7,mtms2007-11-218a,,
"Each permutation is the reverse of another. For example, 123456 and 654321 are reverse permutations. If you take a permutation and add its reverse, 777,777 will always appear (e.g., 123456 + 654321 = 777777). Since there are 720 permutations, 360 pairs of permutations can be combined to sum to 777,777. So the total sum will be 360 × 777,777, or 279,999,720. ●",8,mtms2007-11-218a,,
