92,Introducing Volume 19: Developing Mathematical Thinkers,"introducing volume 19 developing Mathematical thinkers oOne of my favorite memories as a middle school teacher  occurred when a student interrupted my lesson to declare, “You really like this stuff, don’t you?” I was happy that the student recognized my enthusiasm and love of mathematics. More important, I hoped that as I helped my students become mathematical thinkers that they would develop their own love of mathematics. Whether we are classroom teachers, mathematics coaches, curriculum specialists, supervisors, or teacher educators, a new school year provides us with many opportunities to facilitate students’ and teachers’ development as mathematical thinkers.

93,Introducing Volume 19: Developing Mathematical Thinkers,"The MTMS Editorial Panel, top row, left: Bob McDonald, Sara-Lynn Gopalkrishna, and Sandi Cooper;  middle row: Rebecca Damas, Bob Klein, and Jane Porath; front row: Kay Wohlhuter, Rob Ely, and Christine Avila  (MTMS) will continue the strong tradition of being a resource that challenges the readership to think about the teaching and learning of mathematics while providing ideas that can be used in classroom and professional development settings. Collectively, the feature articles and the regular departments of Quick Reads, Mathematical Explorations, Math for Real, Informing Practice, Cartoon Corner, and Solve It! in conjunction with Solve It! Student Thinking will offer multiple occasions for contemplating, analyzing, and implementing various mathematical practices and concepts. The crucial but often perplexing concepts of rational numbers will be featured in the  February 2014 Focus Issue. ",93,Introducing Volume 19: Developing Mathematical Thinkers
94,Introducing Volume 19: Developing Mathematical Thinkers,"Along with launching volume 19, we are looking to  solve The MTMS Word Problem—finding a new name for the journal. During the next month, you will have an opportunity to vote on a potential new name for MTMS. We look forward to seeing your selection that best represents our journal. Please vote for your favorite choice at http://nctm.org/mtmswordproblem.",94,Introducing Volume 19: Developing Mathematical Thinkers
95,Introducing Volume 19: Developing Mathematical Thinkers,"To stay current on offerings and to read the MTMS  digital journal, be sure to explore NCTM’s and the journal’s website at www.nctm.org. You will find articles from current and back issues, a problem database, current calls for manuscript topics, and guidelines for submissions. In particular, we would like to highlight the call for the 2015 Focus Issue on Mathematical Modeling (see, also,  p. 15). Writing manuscripts is just one way to be involved in the publication of  MTMS. We also need volunteers to use their expertise while working as a manuscript referee.

96,Introducing Volume 19: Developing Mathematical Thinkers,It is important for the Editorial Panel to hear from  you. Please give us feedback on the articles and departments. We would be proud to publish your thoughts in Readers Write. You can also follow us on twitter at  @mtms_at_NCTM and share what you find useful and interesting.,96,Introducing Volume 19: Developing Mathematical Thinkers
