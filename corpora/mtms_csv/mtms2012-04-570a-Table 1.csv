"Pamela Weber Harris, former secondary mathematics teacher turned education consultant and author of Building (Powerful) Numeracy for Middle and High School Students, suggests an excellent framework not only for building numeracy but also for extending mathematical ideas, such as the four operations, first presented in elementary schools.

"She suggests that, to build number sense, middle school and high school teachers should move their students away from merely working algorithms toward developing an array of problem-solving strategies. Harris gives teachers an assortment of ideas for building numeracy in their students. For instance, she presents options for geometry, algebra, and precalculus classes. Using the ideas presented in the book will build students who are creative, effective, confident, and flexible mathematicians. ",8,mtms2012-04-570a,,
"The activities presented fall into  two general categories: representations of strategies on models, such as open number lines and problem strings, and sequences of related problems that build numerical relationships. The ten-chapter book can be broken down into four general sections: numeracy; addition and subtraction; multiplication and division; and decimals, fractions, and percentages. ",9,mtms2012-04-570a,,
"As students apply the representation strategies outlined, they undoubtedly will become more accurate, flexible, and effective mathematicians. Further, teachers will become better professionals as they move beyond the drill and kill of solving algorithms to building number skills in their students each year. ",10,mtms2012-04-570a,,

The Complete Idiot’s Guide to Algebra Practice Problems is a workbook geared for students of middle school age up to those taking  a college algebra course. The book contains a great logical progression through algebraic concepts or could be used to look up a single topic. A strength is that it shows multiple ways of solving problems in a language that is not intimidating to most. ,14,mtms2012-04-570a,,
"A weakness is that it does not  contain a preassessment and postassessment to track one’s progress. With ample room to solve the Now It’s Your Turn practice problems and an answer key to check work, this book would be great for those who need a bit of remediation or just want to refresh their skills. Reality Checks show the relevance of math to the real world to answer the question that everyone asks, “When will I ever use this in everyday life?” I would highly recommend this book for my classroom students both in secondary school and also in my college course.  —Michelle Hopkins",15,mtms2012-04-570a,,

"Crypto Mind Benders is an activity book of logic-based puzzles appropriate for all middle-school-age students that introduces and reinforces solving for unknown values. Each puzzle gives students a series of algebraic relationships as inequalities and equations along with a list of possible values for the variables. The puzzles are set up for students to use deductive reasoning to determine which value corresponds to the different variables. Each activity page includes a series of logic puzzles, and students use the solutions to decode a cryptogram of a joke or famous quotation at the bottom of the page. ",19,mtms2012-04-570a,,
"The thirty activity pages can be used in any order, and the author provides a nice variety of difficulty level, ranging from simple inequalities to compound inequalities and equations. He also points out the lack of text on each activity page as helpful for English language learners. The main feature of this book that I find helpful is the cryptogram on the bottom of the page because it allows students to self-check their work. This book could be used as either an extension activity for students interested in learning more algebra at earlier grades or as a way to introduce systems of equations and inequalities. Although the activities fall short in developing general relationships of equations and inequalities, it is definitely worthwhile as a supplementary activity text. ",20,mtms2012-04-570a,,
I would recommend this book for any middle school teacher but especially those working with students in algebra.  —Nicholas J. Gilbertson,21,mtms2012-04-570a,,

"I was thrilled to receive a copy of Extending Children’s Mathematics: Fractions and Decimals by Susan B. Empson and Linda Levi just a  few weeks before teaching a unit on rational number concepts and fraction operations to my sixth-grade class. The authors describe a sequence of instruction for kindergarten through sixth grade that focuses on students’ intuitive understanding of sharing and partitioning. Many chapters end with both a bank of questions and suggested guidelines for each grade level, making this an excellent resource for individual teachers and teams of teachers who are coordinating curricula and approaches to instruction across grade levels. ",25,mtms2012-04-570a,,
"There is also a significant emphasis on how children’s thinking about fractions and decimals connects to algebraic concepts and relational thinking strategies. For this reason, teachers of seventh-grade and eighth-grade students who continue to struggle with fractions and decimals would likely find the book helpful as well. I devoted eight lessons to the “equal sharing” and “multiple groups” problems described in the book and found that students demonstrated many of the same strategies as shown in the examples of student work. A number of students protested when told that it was time to move on from the equal sharing problems because they enjoyed them so much. ",26,mtms2012-04-570a,,

"Amy Benjamin, a veteran English teacher and literacy specialist, has written a summary of literacy strategies with great potential to enhance students’  learning of mathematics. ",31,mtms2012-04-570a,,
"As an experienced math teacher with no training in literacy instruction, I found this book particularly useful because the content was largely new to me, well expressed, and directly supportive of my goals to teach math with understanding. Among other topics, Benjamin clarifies the process of acquiring mathematical vocabulary, provides models of language-based formative assessments in math, offers strategic methods to help students decode word problems, and illuminates the teaching of effective note taking and note using. She presents helpful tools for those of us who have no training as writing teachers to incorporate writing tasks in our math instruction and assessment. Throughout, she argues compellingly for the importance of using a balance of reading, writing, speaking, and listening tasks with students of all learning styles and backgrounds. ",32,mtms2012-04-570a,,
"All information is presented in a  clear, concise, and straightforward manner, peppered with references to supporting research from both literacy and mathematics education. The introduction highlights connections to the Standards for Mathematical Practice found in the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics. ",33,mtms2012-04-570a,,
I would recommend this book to math coaches as well as math teachers of any grade level who do not also teach language arts. Individual chapters could easily be used as stand-alone articles for professional development.  —Anna Maria Licameli,34,mtms2012-04-570a,,

"There are few strengths with this book. This book does address misconceptions common to most of the topics explored and presents the correct way to solve problems. In addition, the language used is accessible to students who have a cursory understanding of mathematics, and important statements are set off with text boxes and graphics.",39,mtms2012-04-570a,,
The few strengths are offset by the many weaknesses in this book. Chief among the weaknesses is that the book is purely mechanical; it does not provide any opportunities for readers to understand why the mechanics work. ,40,mtms2012-04-570a,,
"At no time does the book present the mathematics in a cohesive, connected manner or provide an opportunity for students to make sense of the mathematics. Although it comprehensively covers the scope of junior high mathematics, it provides only a cursory glimpse into procedures followed by a set of similar problems with which students can practice the procedures. This book seems to promote memorization and procedures over sense making. I cannot recommend this book.  —Jerilynn Lepak",41,mtms2012-04-570a,,

"The Pythagorean relationship is one of several units in the AIMS Essential Math Series that use overall real-world investigations,  comics, animation, and video to engage students and help them discover and make sense of key mathematical concepts. This unit uses all of these features as well as some problem-solving situations and assessments. ",44,mtms2012-04-570a,,
The booklet provides details for three lessons and their corresponding extensions. Each lesson includes some instructional information for the teacher followed by copies of all student activity pages and accompanying lesson highlights and review presented in a comic strip format. A set of ten problems taken from a variety of realworld contexts are provided with two assessment activities. A brief glossary of essential terms and some guidelines  on how to use the comics effectively are also given. The booklet concludes with a thoughtful essay on the significance of the Pythagorean relationship. ,45,mtms2012-04-570a,,
"Students do encounter irrational numbers in the lesson that uses dot paper and the geoboard. I think that the accompanying compact disc is an integral feature that will make the material even more appealing to students. The CD takes the teacher step by step through each lesson and adds helpful mathematical commentary in the process. The comics are more lively on screen, and the added feature that animation brings to the lessons, especially to the one on puzzles, is most attractive.

This book helps teachers recognize that they are not implementing these strategies only for ELLs, but rather enhancing the learning of all students in their classrooms. ",50,mtms2012-04-570a,,
"The descriptions of various levels  of questioning were very well organized, and the many examples helped  clarify the differences between the levels. The repeated use of sentence frames throughout the lessons seemed very effective in supporting language development. On page 38, however, the third frame should read “The tenths place digit is greater than the hundredths place digit” since almost any number in the tenths place would be greater in value than any number in the hundredths place. ",51,mtms2012-04-570a,,
"It would be helpful to offer specific examples of the strategies rather than simply describing the strategies (chapter 1). The teacher-student interactions described throughout the book were well thought out. The teacher did a great job of guiding the discussions to allow students to demonstrate their understanding. By providing actual transcripts of the interactions, the reader is able to gain insight into the use of the recommended strategies with actual students in a real classroom. ",52,mtms2012-04-570a,,
