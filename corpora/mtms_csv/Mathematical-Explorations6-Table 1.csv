3,Mathematical Explorations: Visualizing Algebraic Rules for the nth Term,"Determining an algebraic expression to generalize a pattern is an important part of the middle school mathematics curriculum. This article describes an activity that gives students opportunities to engage in the mathematical skills of representing, analyzing, and generalizing as well as evaluating algebraic expressions and determining if two expressions are equal (NCTM 2000; CCSSI 2010) as they verbally describe the patterns they see in a sequence of tile images. They then use the images to develop an algebraic rule, or expression, for the nth figure. One method for finding the generalized algebraic rule for these types of tile sequences is to create a table that pairs the number of tiles with each figure number (see fig. 1). By studying the patterns in the numbers, an appropriate algebraic expression can be determined in various ways. For example, students may see that the number of tiles increases by 3 with each additional figure. They may reason that to find the nth figure, they would multiply  n × 3, which can also be expressed as 3n; however, the number of tiles for the first figure is 2 fewer than 3, so ",3,Mathematical Explorations: Visualizing Algebraic Rules for the nth Term

5,Mathematical Explorations: Visualizing Algebraic Rules for the nth Term,"they must subtract 2. Therefore, the expression is 3n – 2. Because many students struggle with using a table of numbers to generate the algebraic rule, the method described for this activity involves focusing on images rather than numbers. With this method, there is no need to count the tiles in each figure and create a table. Instead, the students connect the figure number to the image by identifying a grouping associated with the figure number. The following example explains this process more fully.",5,Mathematical Explorations: Visualizing Algebraic Rules for the nth Term

Study the images and look for a pattern. The images will be numbered 1, 2, 3, and so on. Your task is to explain how to build or draw the 8th tile image in the pattern without building or drawing the previous images.

14,Mathematical Explorations: Visualizing Algebraic Rules for the nth Term,"The goal of this activity is for  students to identify an explicit, rather than a recursive, pattern. A recursive pattern requires that one knows the previous term; however, with an explicit pattern, the algebraic rule for the nth term can be determined independently of the preceding figure. As students are completing this  activity, circulate around the room to watch for signs of recursive thinking. If student A is asking student B to build or draw the 8th image by first building or drawing the previous 7 images, then he or she is using a recursive pattern and not an explicit pattern, as intended. This type of thinking will not lead to the explicit  rule. Guide students to incorporate the image number in some way. Sometimes it helps to ask how they would explain how to draw the 50th image (because we certainly do not want them to do that recursively).

To promote discussion and note taking of the different approaches, give each student a copy of activity sheet 1. Assure the class that the pattern can be seen in various ways. Encourage students to share how they described the pattern to their partner or how it was described to them. As students explain their thinking, use the images on activity sheet 1 to illustrate how they can be shaded. ",16,Mathematical Explorations: Visualizing Algebraic Rules for the nth Term
17,Mathematical Explorations: Visualizing Algebraic Rules for the nth Term,"Next, show students how to sketch the 8th image and use that sketch to determine the number of tiles. Repeat this process with the 50th image.  Finally, demonstrate how to generalize a sketch of the nth image and how to write an algebraic expression to represent the number of tiles in the nth image. Point out that this expression can be used to determine the number of tiles in each image. For example, if you substitute 3 into their expression for pattern 1 and evaluate it, you should get 7. It is important  that students understand that 7 represents the number of tiles it takes to build the 3rd image.",17,Mathematical Explorations: Visualizing Algebraic Rules for the nth Term

Put 8 tiles vertically down the center, then put 7 tiles horizontally on each side of the top tile. With this description, students are seeing the pattern shown in figure 2. The vertical column of tiles down the center is the same as the figure number. To illustrate, we shade that vertical column of tiles. The number of tiles on each side of the top tile is one fewer than the term number. If we use n to represent the figure number, then we have  n tiles down the center with n – 1 tiles on each side.

25,Mathematical Explorations: Visualizing Algebraic Rules for the nth Term,"Developing rules with this method  often results in different, but equivalent, algebraic expressions. These rules provide an ideal opportunity to reinforce students’ developing skills at simplifying expressions and using them to determine if two expressions are equivalent. As students present different expressions for the same pattern, ask them how they can tell if the pattern is equivalent to the expression already presented. Some students may determine equivalence by substituting a value for n and then evaluating the numerical expression. These students may need guidance to appreciate that their algebraic skills for simplifying expressions can also be used to determine equivalence. For example, each  of the expressions developed from the three descriptions above can be simplified to 3n – 2.  extending to Quadratic exPressions",25,Mathematical Explorations: Visualizing Algebraic Rules for the nth Term

It is unnecessary for students to be able to recognize or manipulate quadratic expressions to be successful in writing them.

32,Mathematical Explorations: Visualizing Algebraic Rules for the nth Term,"Consider the tile pattern shown in figure 6b. There are several ways the rule for this sequence could be determined  through visual inspection. One observation is that the term number corresponds to the height of the first column in each tile image, thus leading to the discovery of an n × n square imbedded in the image. If we set aside that square and look at the remaining image, we find an n × (n – 1) rectangle. For the first term, this would be a  1 × 0 rectangle, so it is not pictured. Finally, each image has two additional tiles. This description is depicted in figure 7.
