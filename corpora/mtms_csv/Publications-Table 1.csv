7,Publications,"This book systematically examines several facets of the classroom environment, including discourse, tasks, assessment, family involvement, and the physical arrangement. The authors clearly explain the rationale for each suggestion and provide tasks and questions for the reader throughout the book. The authors provide examples from actual classrooms, using photographs, lesson transcripts, and a collection of online videos that the reader can access for additional context. The text also discusses the appropriate integration of technology throughout the chapters.",7,Publications
8,Publications,"Each chapter strikes a great  balance between practical classroom examples and connections to NCTM’s Principles to Action and other research. This makes the text especially thought-provoking.  Reimagining the Mathematics Classroom is structured to encourage reflection and discourse. I believe it would be effective as a team book study. I would also recommend it for teachers looking to reflect on their classroom culture, particularly at the start of the school year or at the beginning of a new assignment. ",8,Publications

15,Publications,"Number Talks: Fractions, Decimals and Percentages is an excellent resource for engaging upper elementary and  middle school students in developing understanding of fractions, decimals, and percentages. Built on the proven effectiveness of number talks as an instructional strategy and grounded in the research on how students  come to understand fractional concepts, the book helps teachers plan number talks that have students thinking, reasoning, and discussing their mathematical ideas and rational numbers in ways that develop  computational flexibility and deepen understanding.",15,Publications
16,Publications,The book begins with an overview of the number talks strategy and goes on to provide guidance for using number talks to help students develop fractional reasoning and make sense  of fraction and decimal operations. The authors take care to show how strategies and arithmetic properties with which students are already familiar from whole-number computation can extend to their work with decimals and fractions.,16,Publications
17,Publications,"In addition to the strategies, tools,  student examples, and problem sets in the print materials, as well as the downloadable reproducibles, one of the great features of this resource is  the plethora of video examples, accessible by either scanning the QR code or entering the provided URL. Whether one is new to number talks or an “old hand” at this instructional strategy, the videos provide a window into both the teacher actions in leading the talk and the students’ mathematical thinking.",17,Publications

The book starts out with the definition of what prime numbers are and works  up to proofs explaining concepts like prime number conjectures. The book is for anyone who wants to know more about prime numbers or to feel more confident in their knowledge of them. I would use the following chapters with my sixth-grade and seventh-grade students: “What are Prime Numbers?” “Division Is Harder Than Multiplication,” “How Natural Numbers Are Made out of Primes,” and “Tell Me: Which Is the Largest Prime?” ",30,Publications
31,Publications,"The book is an easy read, and the  dialogue between the two friends is humorous and light-hearted, considering the material. When I first flipped through the book, I thought, “Oh no! What have I gotten myself into?” Just looking at some of the proofs had me scratching my head. I am an elementary math teacher who has not done more than seventhgrade material since I was in college. I put the book aside and came back to it later. Then I decided to start from the beginning. I found that I was a lot like Eric. ",31,Publications
