0,Making the Most of Modeling Tasks - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Ask a mathematics teacher what mathematical modeling is, and the variety of answers can be surprising. On the one hand, models can be tables, graphs, diagrams, equations, expressions, or numerical sentences, to name a few. Although there is disagreement about some aspects of its meaning, mathematical modeling, on the other hand, generally involves taking a real-world scenario and translating it into the mathematical world (Niss, Blum, and Galbraith 2007). To do so entails finding a construct to represent the scenario. The complete modeling process involves describing situations posed in problems with mathematical concepts, relationships, diagrams, and symbolic expressions; manipulating and reasoning about those representations to derive new information; making predictions based on the results; and verifying predictions in the original problem situation (Lesh and Doerr 2003; Lesh and Zawojewski 2007).",,
1,Making the Most of Modeling Tasks - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"During the process of modeling,students apply what they already know as well as build and deepen their mathematical understanding of new mathematical content. For these reasons, modeling is important, which may be why the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSI 2010) emphasizes the topic as not only a conceptual category in the high school curriculum but also a Standard for Mathematical Practice. As such, mathematical modeling should be part of mathematics learning, starting in the early grades. This implies that modeling is not an area of mathematics to be taught in isolation, but one that should permeate across content in the curriculum for all grades. If modeling is to play an important role throughout the mathematics curriculum, we should consider the opportunities that students have to engage in tasks that strongly support modeling practices as well as those in which modeling is less visible.",,
2,Making the Most of Modeling Tasks - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,CHARACTERISTICS OF MODELING TASKS,,
3,Making the Most of Modeling Tasks - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Modeling, or at least the development of essential skills for modeling, can be incorporated into middle school mathematics lessons across the curriculum without needing to tack on extra lessons. As with other mathematical practices, such as estimation or justification, we can best support students understanding of modeling when it is developed on a regular basis, rather than in isolated situations. This question then arises:",,
4,Making the Most of Modeling Tasks - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,What should we look for in tasks that promote proficiency in modeling?,,
5,Making the Most of Modeling Tasks - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"First, modeling should be based on a realistic context to help motivate the need for mathematical thinking and tools to solve problems that are interesting or personally useful to students (Lesh et al. 2008). Contexts do not have to be real world; rather, situations can be experientially real (Freudenthal 1973) to be imaginable by students. For example, problems can be drawn from an imagined world as long as enough description and relevance allow students to engage with the problem and mathematical ideas in a meaningful way (Lesh and Zawojewski 2007; English 2003). If a task has potentially problematic language or scenarios, teachers can help clarify the context when launching the task by displaying relevant images or videos and allowing students to build on their prior knowledge of the scenario by discussing the context (Jackson et al. 2012).",,
6,Making the Most of Modeling Tasks - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Modeling tasks should also require student sense making. Making sense of the context and the underlying mathematics is what sets modeling tasks apart from traditional story problems and application problems. Students should be able to choose appropriate mathematical resources and tools to effectively interpret situations (English 2006). Often, this means allowing for multiple possible models and solution paths. When a problem can be approached using different strategies, including visual or abstract representations, students have flexibility to draw on the context to make sense of the problem. This keeps the realistic aspects of the task central in problem solving.",,
7,Making the Most of Modeling Tasks - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Finally, and perhaps most important, good modeling tasks provide opportunities to build mathematical understanding and engage in other mathematical practices (English 2006). That is, modeling tasks do much more than build skills in modeling. They provide an arena and motivation for students to learn specific content, such as fraction addition or the behavior of linear equations, and develop their understanding of mathematical practices, such as explaining their reasoning and critiquing the arguments of others (CCSSI 2010). Modeling is not just one more thing to add to an already full curriculum; it can be a regular part of mathematics learning.",,
8,Making the Most of Modeling Tasks - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,TWO TYPES OF MODELING TASKS,,
9,Making the Most of Modeling Tasks - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We selected examples of two types of tasks from existing curricula and online resources to illustrate their potential for supporting students in their modeling endeavors. The first type of task, as written, can support students mathematical modeling. It may seem ideal, but finding these types of tasks can be challenging, not to mention the difficulties that ensue when fitting them into a coherent mathematical curriculum. The second type are tasks that can become stronger by modifying or by emphasizing particular aspects during implementation.",,
10,Making the Most of Modeling Tasks - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Task 1: Building Bridges,,
11,Making the Most of Modeling Tasks - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"An example of the first type is called Bridge Thickness and Strength from Thinking with Mathematical Models, a grade 8/algebra 1 unit from Connected Mathematics 3 (Lappan et al. 2014). It asks students to investigate how the strength of a bridge beam is related to its thickness. Students create two models, a physical model (see fig. 1) and an algebraic model. Using books, paper, and a small cup with pennies to simulate the loads on the bridge, students collect data on the breaking weights of paper bridges that are one to five layers thick.",,
12,Making the Most of Modeling Tasks - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
13,Making the Most of Modeling Tasks - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Students start with a bridge that is one layer thick; they continue adding pennies until the bridge breaks. Then, they repeat the experiment with bridges of different thicknesses. The data on thickness and breaking weight allow students to model the relationship between these two variables. Students are prompted to make a table and graph to represent the data. These representations help students predict values between and beyond the data they collected and justify their reasoning (see fig. 2). Students can verify their predictions by testing them with the thickness given in question D. This task completes the full modeling cycle by having students first collect data, represent them in a way that allows them to make predictions, and then verify the results.",,
14,Making the Most of Modeling Tasks - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
15,Making the Most of Modeling Tasks - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"This task has potential to be a good modeling task. First, the context is a realistic situation. Although students are making paper bridges and not real ones, the idea that being able to predict when a bridge might break is important because testing at full scale would be expensive and the consequences of not modeling (i.e., by guessing) would be potentially disastrous. Additionally, the task requires sense making to determine which variables are important and to accurately predict the breaking points between and beyond the data set investigated. Finally, this task provides opportunities for students to deepen their mathematical understanding. They can apply their knowledge of graphing data points and analyzing the shapes of different graphs while developing their new understanding of linear and nonlinear relationships. The posters in figure 3 show samples of students tables, graphs, and predictions about the breaking weights of different bridges. During this project, several students said the relationship was nonlinear (as in part B on the second poster), which elicited a discussion about what it means for real data to show a linear trend. The task also provides opportunities to consider how to model relationships using a variety of representations and decide which representation most effectively helps with predicting breaking weights.",,

17,Making the Most of Modeling Tasks - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Task 2: The Truck and Boxes Task,,
18,Making the Most of Modeling Tasks - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The example for the second type of task came from Saxon Math 5 (Hake and Saxon 2004), but it has variants (such as the sixth-grade Optimizing: Packing It In task developed by the Mathematics Assessment Project; see http://map.mathshell.org/materials/lessons.php?taskid=591&subpage=problem). The main focus of this task is to determine the maximum number of rectangular boxes that can fit in a rectangular semitrailer. It describes how store merchandise is usually shipped in trucks, then gives the dimensions of available space inside the truck: 5 feet wide, 6 feet high, and 20 feet long. The task also shows a box labeled with a This End Up! sign with dimensions of 2.5 feet long, 2 feet wide, and 3 feet tall. Students are asked the following questions:",,
19,Making the Most of Modeling Tasks - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"This problem has the potential to be an interesting modeling task because calculating the maximum number of objects that can fit it in a space is an important and realistic application of mathematics. That said, some modifications or enhancements can emphasize more of the modeling aspects and increase opportunities for student sense making.",,
20,Making the Most of Modeling Tasks - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"As mentioned in the introduction, modeling often involves the process of describing, manipulating, predicting, and verifying. This task could ask students to describe the situation mathematically, such as by creating scale drawings showing the different orientations of the trailer (e.g., a back view and a top view), thus helping students find how many boxes would fit from multiple perspectives. Students could also create a three-dimensional model of the trailer and the boxes to see how they could fit into the trailer. Once students have described the situation, students could manipulate the physical three-dimensional models or manipulate the situation symbolically using equations that help describe the number of boxes that could fit on particular sides. Finally, students could make a prediction based on their model and then consider how they would verify their prediction, perhaps by solving the problem in a different way.",,
21,Making the Most of Modeling Tasks - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Another possibility for increasing the modeling opportunities is to reconsider particular aspects of the task. For example, the task as written provides a fair amount of scaffolding. We implemented another version with sixth graders in which we provided the boxs dimensions (with the This end up! statement removed), an image of the truck, and the prompt asking students to see if they could determine the maximum number of boxes that could fit in the space available in the trailer (see fig. 4).",,
22,Making the Most of Modeling Tasks - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
23,Making the Most of Modeling Tasks - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"What is particularly interesting about the truck task is that the orientation of the boxes makes a difference as to fit. Not leading students to think about stacking boxes against the back wall generated multiple strategies, including verbal descriptions of how to pack the boxes (see fig. 5) and different perspectives of the truck (see fig. 6). It also allowed for different packing solutions, such as the ones in figure 6. Discussions also occurred about why certain strategies do not always work, such as calculating the volume of each container and then finding the quotient of the two volumes. For advanced students, the task had natural extensions, such as requiring students to leave a one-foot path to the back of the truck. Considering available space with an unknown side length may open up new opportunities to think about the importance of having trailer dimensions that are multiples of the box dimensions.",,

26,Making the Most of Modeling Tasks - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,TURN EXISTING TASKS INTO MODELING ACTIVITIES,,
27,Making the Most of Modeling Tasks - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Although good modeling tasks can be hard to generate on our own, they can be found in most curricula if we know what to look for. In many cases, modifying, enhancing, or illuminating the modeling opportunities of existing tasks can give students more opportunities for improving their understanding of and ability to engage in mathematical modeling.",,
28,Making the Most of Modeling Tasks - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"An important first step is noticing tasks that have realistic contexts, that require students sense-making abilities, and that help develop new mathematical understanding. The next step is to identify opportunities to engage students in modeling, either exploring the full modeling process or emphasizing one or two elements of modeling. Not all contextual problems are appropriate as full-scale modeling tasks, but we can make the most of what is in our curricula and be explicit with students about the modeling skills they are developing. We should not expect students to master modeling overnight; however, with continued and sustained opportunities to engage in modeling activities, students will begin to see the power and relevance of this important area of mathematics.",,
