"Mathematics education is replete with activities that explore real-world problems. A variety of these problems are added to lessons in the belief that merely applying mathematics knowledge to everyday contexts will enhance the transfer of that knowledge to other settings.

"Quantitative literacy (QL) is also  an important part of mathematics education. QL holds that what  people need most in their everyday and work lives is fundamental mathematics knowledge that is applied in varied and complex contexts requiring common-sense reasoning.

"NCTM endorses learning mathematics “for life,” stating, “Making purchasing decisions, choosing insurance or health plans, and voting knowledgeably all call for quantitative sophistication” (NCTM 2000, p. 4). Such decisions involve authentic realworld thinking that calls on, at the least, the Process Standards of Reasoning, Problem Solving, Communication, and Connections. However, Hallett asserts, “The general level of quantitative literacy is currently sufﬁ ciently limited that it threatens the ability of citizens to make wise decisions at work and in public and private life” (2003, p. 91). QL, she says, is mainly about how well mathematics can be used. Further, she claims that the mathematical foundation of QL, in other words, the mathematics content that is especially fundamental to QL, begins in middle school.",11,mtms2011-04-492a,,
"We describe two similar quantitative literacy lessons in which students examine popular songs and movies to ﬁ nd patterns and trends. The lesson involving songs was taught to a ﬁ fthgrade class; the lesson on movies, to a sixth-grade class. Both tasks were also completed by a graduate-level teacher education class on mathematical problem solving.",12,mtms2011-04-492a,,

STUDENT PERFORMANCE AND FEEDBACK,58,mtms2011-04-492a,,
Popular Songs,59,mtms2011-04-492a,,
"The ﬁ fth graders, who worked in pairs on this activity, tended to choose one song as their number-one choice  (“I Gotta Feeling”), but the topthree choices were distributed mainly among six songs, with second and third choices showing most variation. About two-thirds of the pairs attempted a mathematical approach to make their decision. Explanations tended to be vague references to the use of one or more of the rankings. However, some explanations were speciﬁ c. Two pairs said that they used the three songs that had been on the chart the longest. Two other pairs said they summed all four columns and used the results to ﬁ nd the highest three totals. (This approach is inappropriate in that the lowest number is best in three columns and the highest number is best in one column.) However, about one-third of the students chose nonmathematical strategies by considering their own preferences. One pair wrote, “We put them in the  order from the ones we liked to order from the ones we liked to the ones we didn’t like so much.” the ones we didn’t like so much.” Another pair stated, “[We ranked them this way] because we both think ‘Down’ and ‘You Belong with Me’ are great songs to listen to and have the right beat and rhythm.”",60,mtms2011-04-492a,,
"The graduate students, who  worked in groups of four, were more consistent in their top song choices. Their highest rankings were assigned predominantly to four songs, with “Use Somebody” edging out the others for ﬁ rst. Their reasoning was mathematical. Although the explanations tended to be somewhat general, they indicated use of one to four columns of information, especially number of weeks on the chart. The songs’ peak rankings were also important to some students; they used the other rankings in a variety of ways. ",61,mtms2011-04-492a,,
"Graduate students showed greater understanding of real-world factors that affect ticket sales, such as the economy, time of year, and home-viewing options.",62,mtms2011-04-492a,,
"some students included real-world thinking that went beyond the data. They mentioned which artists seemed to be getting a lot of airplay, who was a popular or rising artist, which songs had just come out, and the fact that Taylor Swift’s songs were played on many different types of stations.",63,mtms2011-04-492a,,
"Fifth graders made random  comments about additional information they would have liked to know: the percent of people who like the song, how many people voted for the songs, how many CDs containing the song were sold in the past three weeks, and the degree to which the songs’ rankings had ﬂ uctuated on the chart. Some also suggested surveying classmates’ opinions on the songs for further data. ",64,mtms2011-04-492a,,
"All the graduate students’ comments were clearly tied to enhancing information needed to make their decisions. Examples include the total revenue earned for each song (or sales numbers), how long the songs had been out (release dates), how much time the songs had spent at each rank, and song rankings in previous weeks as well as rankings beyond the top ten spots. They considered other ways of gauging popularity, such as the number of purchases made through Internet downloads and the number of times the songs were requested for radio play. They also wanted more information about data collection and preparation, such as who and how many were polled and how the rankings were determined in terms of weight given to each of the three  factors listed above the chart. Few middle-grades students raised this issue, but it is a critical skill to develop for data analysis.",65,mtms2011-04-492a,,
Popular Movies,66,mtms2011-04-492a,,
"The sixth graders, who worked in groups of four, were consistent in their choice of top movies, listing Titanic as ﬁ rst and The Dark Knight as second with a slight advantage over Pirates of the Caribbean (third). The graduate students chose the same three but reversed the second-place and thirdplace choices and added a fourth, with some students including Star Wars in their top two positions.",67,mtms2011-04-492a,,
"Although a few sixth graders  included their personal opinions of the movies in their decisions, the majority used the same technique: They combined domestic and foreign earnings and took the three highest money generators. Some said they used various types of mental or written estimation, and others calculated actual amounts. About three-fourths of the graduate students used the same technique as most sixth graders. Only a few considered something no sixth graders did— the role of inﬂ ation. One student said, “I looked at this problem in terms of worth of the dollar. The money earned from Star Wars box ofﬁ ce amounts in 1977 would be considered quite a bit of money then.”",68,mtms2011-04-492a,,
Most additional information that the sixth graders wanted was potentially useful. The most requested data were how many tickets were sold (how many people saw the movies)  “I can use this song in math class!”,69,mtms2011-04-492a,,
One student also chose the erroneous method of summing the four columns and using the highest three totals. One group asked if it could have an updated chart ten weeks after the current one to check their predictions.,70,mtms2011-04-492a,,
"Decisions about the songs (chosen only from the chart) likely to be in the top-three positions in ten weeks’ time varied among the students in both classes. The ﬁ fth graders’ choices were wide-ranging and largely unsubstantiated. Two pairs had similar reasoning that seemed most defensible: Both thought that songs that had been on the chart a short time would remain for some time, whereas those that had been there longer would not. One pair justiﬁ ed its choices by explaining, “Because they weren’t there that long. So they weren’t heard as much. So you wouldn’t get sick of them as quick.”",71,mtms2011-04-492a,,
"The graduate students also had a  variety of choices and explanations concerning their predictions. They mainly considered the overall strength of songs’ rankings and songs’ longevity on the chart. Only a few (about one-ﬁ fth) considered whether the songs appeared to be rising or dropping on the chart based on rankings provided for two consecutive weeks. For this decision,  and general opinions of the movies. The graduate students also suggested ticket sales most often but also added ticket prices. Among their other ideas were length of time running in theaters, revenue from sales and rentals, and what other movies were playing at the same time.",72,mtms2011-04-492a,,
"A majority of the sixth graders  and graduate students identiﬁ ed particular movie genres as those they considered most successful by noting which types appeared often on the chart. However, personal opinion seeped in to a small degree. A blatant example of this was a sixth-grade group of students who commented, “We think the romance was most successful because it is a big subject in everyone’s life.” Similarly, one graduate student wrote, “Romance, because it appeals to people’s emotions more than the rest.”",73,mtms2011-04-492a,,
"Some students, predominantly  graduate students, mentioned that the movies were all rated PG and PG13 and pointed out that this type of show “caters to a large group, which includes a young and older audience.” Some adults also said that adventure and action movies appeal to a wider audience, look good on a big screen, and include a greater number of movies. The graduate students showed greater understanding of real-world factors that may affect ticket sales, including the state of the economy, time of year (e.g., summer versus winter), and availability of home movie options (e.g., DVDs, Netﬂ ix®, and On Demand®).",74,mtms2011-04-492a,,
STUDENT INTEREST AND INSIGHTS,75,mtms2011-04-492a,,
At least three-quarters of the middlegrades students expressed high interest in these tasks because of the topics. They liked seeing which songs and movies were most popular and seemed awestruck by how much money was made. Several sixth graders expressed ,76,mtms2011-04-492a,,
Box-ofﬁ ce totals are often viewed with surprise.,77,mtms2011-04-492a,,
"surprise that U.S. movies are shown in other countries. One said, “We didn’t know movies made so much money and that movies go around the world.” This, along with student declarations that they learned that people have different opinions, helped challenge interpersonal as well as cultural awareness. A few students did not like having to work with the large dollar ﬁ gures. Although allowing students to use calculators would be appropriate for both tasks, the substantial use of estimation might warrant keeping them stored away. ",78,mtms2011-04-492a,,
"The graduate students were also  highly engaged in the activities because of the topics, the complexity (yet accessibility) of the problems, and a chance to consider a variety of real-world variables beyond the data. They liked the challenge and believed that students would have a chance to feel successful with these open-ended tasks. Some students in all groups enjoyed a chance to answer “opinion problems.” ",79,mtms2011-04-492a,,
"However, a few graduate students  said that they did not like this type of problem because they preferred problems with “deﬁ nite answers.” One student said the real-world context was distracting because she found herself singing the songs in her head. ",80,mtms2011-04-492a,,
"Students in all classes made some comments that were unimportant to the task, such as giving opinions about the popularity of various songs. ",81,mtms2011-04-492a,,
"For both problems, a few middle- grades students thought the task should be harder. This response may be because they likely treated the problems superﬁ cially and did not problematize them by pondering realworld factors. This may be caused by a lack of experience with these types of problems and having fewer life experiences on which to draw. On the other hand, some students, especially ﬁ fth graders, struggled to apply data interpretation and in-depth thinking to the task. A few did report, however, that they learned how to read a chart and how to use data to answer questions. A graduate student concluded that this activity helped her recognize that “data can be interpreted in many ways.”",82,mtms2011-04-492a,,
"The music task appeared to be  harder than the movie task, so it would have been better to reverse the two grade levels in which these were conducted. More time to discuss relevant contextual (real-world) considerations and student reasoning and decisions would have improved all the lessons, especially at the middle-grades level. ",83,mtms2011-04-492a,,
SUGGESTED TOPICS FOR SIMILAR TASKS,84,mtms2011-04-492a,,
"Music and movies were topics that interested all three student groups. In retrospect, however, songs may best be avoided unless they are restricted to more sanitized types. Some chart climbers have inappropriate lyrics, which inspired a few ﬁ fth graders to consider buying some of these popular songs. This could lead to family concerns about sparking interest in sensitive song content.",85,mtms2011-04-492a,,
"The ﬁ fth and sixth graders suggested topics that would interest students their age. Across the two grade levels, the top ﬁ ve in priority order were these:  •  Books: One sixth grader said, “It would be pretty cool seeing how many Harry Potter and other books are sold in the U.S. and other countries.” •  Sports: Most popular •  Video games: One sixth grader  contended, “Video games get to the mind of people our age like a virus.” •  Animals: Animal facts, types of  animals going extinct, and house pets around the world •  Television shows: Most popular ",86,mtms2011-04-492a,,
"Other suggestions offered by  more than one student were games (e.g., popular board games) and food (including drinks and candy). One student offered the topic of toy sales, and one teacher in the graduate class suggested skateboards and bicycles (e.g., sales and various types of ratings) as good topics for middle schoolers. Because humor, in general, is an engaging theme, some middlegrades students expressed a preference for funny books, comics, and cartoons. ",87,mtms2011-04-492a,,
"Topics picked for these types of authentic problems that mirror in some measure what adults do when they choose home mortgages, credit  cards, and political candidates should be real world, interesting, should be real world, interesting, useful or recreational, and sufﬁ ciently useful or recreational, and sufﬁ ciently complex. For an inexpensive annual fee, ConsumerReports.org offers charts that rate a variety of products on multiple features. The Internet may also be tapped for task data. The sports site at http://www.ala .org/greatsites is one example. Comparing athletes’ touchdown passes, no-hitters, and so on, over time, for example, must consider such factors as number of games typically played on the team schedule during different eras, improvements in equipment and athlete training, and changes in sport rules and playing venues. ",88,mtms2011-04-492a,,
LESSON REFLECTIONS AND SUGGESTIONS,89,mtms2011-04-492a,,
"Group work enhanced students’ understanding and explanations and also challenged their thinking. It would have been better to have the ﬁ fth graders work in groups of four instead of in pairs. Group discussion can be a priority, but all members of a group should not have to agree on an answer. ",90,mtms2011-04-492a,,
"In these lessons, students read charts; looked for patterns in data; and used number sense, computation, estimation, and prediction. The tasks may have invoked more real-world thinking at slightly higher grade levels. If students practice these types of problems routinely as part of a varied problem-solving program, they should hone their skills in the use of appropriate real-world variables. Learning to analyze given facts is important, as is determining what pertinent information is missing from a problem. Additional practice with authentic problems can help students learn to separate irrelevant from relevant information.",91,mtms2011-04-492a,,
"A difference between applying mathematics skills and being quantitatively literate is “the difference between teaching a procedure and  teaching insight” (Hallett 2003, p. 93). Preparing students to be in- formed and active participants in real life is tied to life quality and to issues of social justice for empowering historically marginalized groups (e.g., Wiest, Higgins, and Frost 2007). Using ageappropriate quantitative literacy tasks by at least the middle grades is a good way to start down this path.",92,mtms2011-04-492a,,
