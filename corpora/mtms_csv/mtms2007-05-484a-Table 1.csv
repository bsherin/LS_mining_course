"Anyone who has ever taught basic algebra knows that a majority of mistakes in solving  equations  have  to  do  with  mishandling the negative sign. for example, how often have we seen students, when faced with a situation such as  3x – (x – 10) = 20, begin by writing it in this way:  3x – x – 10 = 20",22,mtms2007-05-484a,,
"When faced with an expression in parentheses preceded by the minus sign, students often fail to either change the signs when  removing  the  parentheses  (multiplying by –1) or they change all but the last sign if three or more terms are inside the parentheses. ",23,mtms2007-05-484a,,
"In  the  author’s  example  of  3x  –  (x  –  10)  =  20,  the  suggestion  “add  +  (x – 10) to both sides” of the equation to get rid of the challenging “– (x – 10)” would rapidly be internalized and filed mentally as a useful tool by advanced students. but to the rest, it would become  another  rule  that  they  would have  to  ponder  anytime  they  see  a bracket in an equation.",24,mtms2007-05-484a,,

Again, I reasoned that I could still use the factorials  to  solve  this  problem  but  had C to  limit  the  solution  to  only  one  line segment between each of the two vertices. So I reasoned that this could be done using the formula:    =  =  2 2 )! ! 2 2 )! ! or  n  things  chosen  two  at  a  time.  In this problem, where n = 6, I have    −   − = × × × 4 3 2 1 × × × 2 1 2 1 − = − 4 6 4 or 2.",40,mtms2007-05-484a,,

"Some Suggestions for Posing Problems THE  EXCELLENT  ArTICLE  “THE  ArT of posing problems and Guiding Investigations”  by  Dugdale,  Matthews,  and Guerrero  (October  2004,  pp.  140–47) describes  an  exciting  way  to  investigate  a  mathematics  problem  with  a class and identifies seven pedagogical components  of  a  successful  lesson. However,  the  orientation  to  group  responses and, at times, to work in small groups  had  the  drawback  of  allowing weaker or slower students to be drawn along by the stronger and quicker students.  When  a  question  is  asked  and the teacher calls on a student volunteer who  responds  verbally,  that  response is heard by all, including students who had not yet decided on a response.",44,mtms2007-05-484a,,
"Several techniques have been used by teachers for years to make sure that each student in the class has ample time to contemplate questions. The teacher might have students whisper their answer in his or her ear before an answer is verbalized for the whole class. In addition, answers can be written at each desk for the teacher to observe as he or she  walks  around  the  classroom.  The teacher knows which students usually require more time to decide on an answer and can make sure that they have been  encouraged  to  answer.  Subtle hints can be given privately.",45,mtms2007-05-484a,,

"There are three vertices: A, B, and C.",47,mtms2007-05-484a,,

"The  question  arises,  however,  as  to how to find the number of diagonals in any polygon, even one with many sides. If there are a large number of sides, a visual inspection is no longer practical and also loses accuracy as we have to draw many more lines.",51,mtms2007-05-484a,,
"I was posed with the following question: How many diagonals are there in a hexagon? When one thinks of finding a diagonal, one thinks intuitively of two points. I could not remember any formula,  so  I  reasoned  that  one  line segment needs two endpoints. Therefore, to count the number of diagonals in the hexagon, I needed to count the number  of  line  segments  between each of the vertices. ",52,mtms2007-05-484a,,
