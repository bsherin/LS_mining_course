0,Letters from Our Readers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1),WHICH IS THE BETTER DEAL?,,
1,Letters from Our Readers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1),"The article “Math for Real: Which Is the Better Deal?” (May 2016, p. 576) attracted my attention because of its unusual use of unit rate. To determine the most economical way to buy a certain amount of fruit punch, the author told students to calculate a unit rate. What got my attention was that the suggested unit rate was mL per dollar, not what came to my mind first, so I decided to investigate.",,
2,Letters from Our Readers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1),"As you can see in table 1, both the unit rate and the total cost for possibility D indicate that it is the most economical of the choices and that possibility C is the second-best choice, according to both indicators.",,

4,Letters from Our Readers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1),"To see what happens when the initial conditions of the problem change, I focused on just these two possibilities. In the original problem, 21,000 mL of fruit punch are needed to serve 700 mL to each of 30 people. I changed this number to 14,950 mL needed to serve 650 mL to each of 23 people. From table 2, you can see that now the possibility with the optimum unit rate, D, is not the most economical choice.",,

6,Letters from Our Readers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1),This new version of the problem and a follow-up discussion could help learners recognize that unit rate is not always a good indicator of best choice. Unit rate is not useful for this problem because the volumes of the available containers limit the purchasable amounts.,,

10,Letters from Our Readers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1),12 RULES THAT EXPIRE,,
11,Letters from Our Readers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1),"I enjoyed the article “12 Math Rules That Expire in the Middle Grades” (November 2015, pp. 208–15). I plan to build an assignment around it for my methods class. The article asked readers to send thoughts about the article, so here goes.",,
12,Letters from Our Readers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1),The next-to-last row in that article’s table 2 discussed using the first letter of a word to describe the variable. It reads:,,
13,Letters from Our Readers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1),What Is Stated or Notated: Using the first letter of the word to describe the variable,,
14,Letters from Our Readers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1),"Alternative Appropriate Statements or Notations: For example, if you use the variable c to represent the number of cars in a problem, when students see 4c in the equation, they think it means 4 cars (using c as a label) rather than 4 times the number of cars. When you select a variable, avoid the first letter of the word and use instead an arbitrary letter to represent the number of cars.",,
15,Letters from Our Readers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1),"I agree with the authors’ reasoning but not all of their conclusions. It can be convenient to mnemonically name variables to remind you of what they refer to, so I think it is usually helpful to take the first initial as the variable. However, the authors’ point about “4c” being mistaken to mean “4 cars” is a good one. However, I think the real point of confusion is this: Is the letter being used as a variable, or it is being used as a label? When we introduce a variable, we should take care to define it properly, as in “Let c represent the number of cars in the parking lot.” Abbreviating this step is dangerous, especially when the same letter might refer to different aspects of the problem. Consider this problem:",,
16,Letters from Our Readers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1),"It costs $10 to get into the carnival, and every ride costs 50 cents. Including the price of admission, what is my total cost per ride if I go on 2 rides? 5 rides? 10 rides?",,
17,Letters from Our Readers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1),"Someone who starts out by saying “C = cost” (or the equivalent) may soon be left wondering which of several different quantities C actually represents: Is it the cost of a ride? Of admission? Total cost after some number of rides? Average cost per ride? And beyond those quandaries, what are the units of C? Using the variable W would not address any of these problems.",,
18,Letters from Our Readers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1),"Now I would say, “Let C represent the cost, in cents, of going into the carnival and riding R rides.” Earlier in my career, I would have rejected that statement as too verbose but (1) verbosity clearly does not offend me any longer, and (2) defining our variables in that way helps us write a useful equation. Sybilla Beckmann’s Mathematics for Elementary Teachers with Activities book helped me get more explicit about both the variable/label dichotomy and the need to attend to units.",,
