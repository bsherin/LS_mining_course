"One challenge that middle school teachers commonly face is finding insightful, hands-on applications when teaching basic mathematical concepts. One concept that is a foundation of middle school mathematics is the notion of linear functions (Capraro and Joffrion 2006). Although a variety of models can be used for linear equations, such as temperature conversions, atmospheric pressure and elevation, and so on, many do not lend themselves easily to classroom applications for students in the middle grades. For a class of eighth graders, a bead-stringing activity was able to illustrate linear equations, slopes, y-intercepts, and graphs. The students were enrolled in a traditional grade-8 mathematics class in a suburban middle school in New England.",3,mtms2009-12-268a,,
"Before beginning the activity, the  students had completed a unit on  graphs, so they were familiar with plotting points that satisfied equations, finding the changes in y and x between points (“rise over run”), identifying points on the x- and y-axes (intercepts), and connecting these points to form a possible line. The students had also developed some skill in solving for one variable when given the other in a two-variable equation using x and y.",4,mtms2009-12-268a,,
"Despite their exposure to these topics, before beginning the bead- stringing activity, the teacher noted that students had some difficulty making the transition from collecting data to using data to construct graphical and symbolic models. Students often complained that they did not understand how a person growing one year older every twelve months related to a linear relationship and how it could form a straight line when graphed. The teacher particularly  hoped that this hands-on activity would provide a way to solidify these real-world connections to mathematics and review some recent content.  stRinging and  chaRting 9 Beads To begin the activity, students were asked to work in small groups and string 9 beads by repeating the pattern of 1 blue, 1 green, and 1 yellow bead. When the group’s string was complete, students recorded in a table the number of beads in the string after each new bead was added. ",5,mtms2009-12-268a,,
"To create a more solid foundation  for the variables in this activity, groups were asked to use the chart they completed to answer questions about the number of beads on the string after stringing the first, second, and third green bead. Figure 1 shows one student’s work on this activity. ",6,mtms2009-12-268a,,
"Fig. 1 after students had worked with 9 beads repeating the pattern of 1 blue, 1 green, and 1 yellow bead, their teacher asked them what the answers 2, 5, and 8 had in common.",7,mtms2009-12-268a,,
"Fig. 2 Students rounded out their bead exploration by plotting the ordered pairs, listed below the graph.",8,mtms2009-12-268a,,
"The students were then asked what  the answers 2, 5, and 8 had in common. After various responses, one student noted the common difference of 3 between the consecutive terms. The small groups were next asked to plot their results on a grid and extend the segment that connected the points. To illustrate the variables, the teacher noted that if the fourth green bead is strung, there would be a total of 11 beads. So the ordered pair corresponding to the example of 11 total beads after the fourth green bead is strung is (4, 11). One group’s results, shown in figure 2, listed the ordered pairs of (1, 2), (2, 5), (3, 8), and (4, 11), as well as the connecting segment that was extended to make a line in the graph.",9,mtms2009-12-268a,,
"To conclude this introductory  activity, the groups were directed to find a ratio, m, for the slope, describing the rate that y changes relative to  x, and an ordered pair representing the point where the line intersects the y-axis. Students used these two answers to create an equation to determine y by multiplying m (y’s rate of change relative to x) by x and adding y’s value when x is zero, or “just the slope-intercept form of a line” as the students later noticed. Students were then asked to use this equation to find the total number of beads on the string after stringing the 25th green bead and to find the number of green beads on the string if the total number of beads strung was 95.",10,mtms2009-12-268a,,
"The next set of questions asked students to determine the slope as a ratio of the change in y to the change in x (in a form that the class used previously for slope, m) and the equation of the line in the slope-intercept form. After one group completed this task, one student made this comment:",11,mtms2009-12-268a,,
"At first, I thought you just plug everything in for x, but then I realized that each variable stands for something. The x is the number of green beads, and the y is the number of beads there are. So, all you do is put the x or y number in the equation, and you get the answer. I think I actually get it.",12,mtms2009-12-268a,,

"To begin the next lesson, the teacher reminded the class about the previous work and then introduced the follow-up activity. Students were to string 12 beads by repeating the pattern blue, blue, green, green, yellow, yellow.",14,mtms2009-12-268a,,
"Table 1 shows ordered pairs in  which—  1.  the first value is the number of  beads on the string of a particular color after each new pair of beads of the next color is strung; and  2.  the second value is the total number of beads on the string.  table 1 Students ordered pairs (x, y) showing the number of each colored bead (x) on the string and the total  number of beads strung (y).",15,mtms2009-12-268a,,

"The next line of questioning involved how many beads were on the string after adding the second and fourth blue bead. Each group found that there were a total of 2 and 8 beads, respectively, on the string after adding these even numbers of blue beads. ",19,mtms2009-12-268a,,
"Students were again asked to plot the ordered pairs on a grid, extend the connecting segment, and sketch the graph of the resulting line. The activity sheet for plotting the points and sketching the graph also contained questions related to the slope and equation of the resulting line. ",20,mtms2009-12-268a,,
"The follow-up questions were essentially the same as those in the first activity. As a result, the teacher found that the groups were less hesitant in identifying the slope, the y-intercept, and in writing an equation for the line. There was also less hesitation when the groups worked on solving the equations, given the particular x- or y-value.  table 3 this summary lists ordered pairs and equations for strings of 9, 12, and 20 beads.",21,mtms2009-12-268a,,

They were excited to create their own patterns but were instructed that their string must contain three colors to keep the results similar. Their work on this assignment resulted in the generalized charts shown as table 4.",22,mtms2009-12-268a,,
"Since another important aspect of classroom interaction is to give ample time to explore questions, students were directed to independently complete an extension activity about another way to string beads. Figure 3 contains the questions the teacher gave students for this extension assignment.",23,mtms2009-12-268a,,
"In the extension activity particularly, the teacher did not specify how to string the beads (one at a time, two at a time, or some other way). This deliberate omission allowed students to complete the assignment using different solutions. Two extension-activity solutions are shown in table 5. In the first solution, students reported that they strung the beads one at a time to signify points representing the xth bead of a particular color, paired with the total number of beads on the string. From the points, they found an equation of the line connecting these points.  eXtending the coloRs",24,mtms2009-12-268a,,
"Groups were then asked to consider an extension that involved repeatedly stringing 2 blue, 1 green, and 2 yellow beads to make a 20-bead string. As in the previous activities, groups were asked to identify the number of beads on the string after the first, second, third, and fourth green beads were added. Table 2 shows the resulting list of ordered pairs and an equation modeling the list. ",25,mtms2009-12-268a,,
"To relate this activity to the previous work, the students were asked to summarize the data that their group collected for each activity, showing the ordered pairs and equations that modeled each bead pattern (see table 3). When asked how the linear equations were determined, one student explained how his group found the equation for the 20-bead string: ",26,mtms2009-12-268a,,
"We began by looking at the patterns of the colors of blue, blue, green, yellow, yellow. When you have the first green bead, you have three beads in all. When you have the second green bead, you have eight beads in all. When you have the third green bead, you have 13 beads in all. When you put these points on a graph and connect the line, it crosses the y-axis on −2. You then count five up and one over between points. The equation is y = 5x – 2.  Students were then asked to  design their own pattern for ",27,mtms2009-12-268a,,
"In the  second solution, students  ing for a written description of the general equations or models that represented the strung beads:  reported that they had strung the beads two at a time. Using this pattern, they then found the points and ordered pairs and resulting  equation shown in table 5. Students also gave another technique for stringing the beads wherein 1 blue bead, followed by 2 green beads, followed by 1 yellow bead was used to make the string. This technique gave the same solution that other students obtained by stringing beads one at a time. Because students successfully identified generalizations of the activities, the teacher gave them an opportunity for enrichment by ask-",28,mtms2009-12-268a,,
"The numerator of the slope looks like it’s the number of beads in the pattern. In our problems, it was always a 3, 5, or 6 because there were that many beads in the pattern. The 1 or 2 in the bottom of the slope looks like the number of beads of some color. The y-intercept is a negative 3, 2, 1, or a 0, and it’s the same as how many more beads need to be put on the string to finish the pattern.",29,mtms2009-12-268a,,
This student’s description reflects an enhanced understanding of the role that slope and y-intercept play in the formulation of the strung-beads ,30,mtms2009-12-268a,,
Fig. 3 Students were given additional bead-pattern questions and asked to fill out a table. ,31,mtms2009-12-268a,,
"We want to put 12 beads on a string by following the pattern: blue, green, green, yellow, blue, green, green, yellow, . . . .",32,mtms2009-12-268a,,
"1. use a table to record the total number of beads on the string after the  first, second, and third blue beads are added.",33,mtms2009-12-268a,,

"Example: if after stringing the first blue bead, there is a total of 1 bead on the string, then the point to plot is (1, 1). For each line, find the slope, the y-intercept, and an equation of the line. use the table below to record your results.",37,mtms2009-12-268a,,
"(Blue, total) (green, total) (Yellow, total) point 1 point 2 point 3 equation model. Although not typical of many students’ initial grasp of the components of linear equations, it illustrates that the strung-beads model provides exploratory opportunities for students at a range of achievement levels.",38,mtms2009-12-268a,,
"This activity also gives students  ways to analyze and apply linear functions in a logical, step-by-step manner. This, in turn, can lead to an enhancement of their reasoning skills that enable better understanding of linear equations and their graphs. Teachers frequently notice that students have difficulty developing these reasoning skills (Nunes et al. 2007); this activity provides a structure for students to exercise these very skills.",39,mtms2009-12-268a,,
"The classroom teacher who conducted this lesson indicated that it was particularly helpful because the activity used information that students needed to learn, and it encouraged them to apply it. Students were not just given formulas to evaluate for particular values but were encouraged to create their own tables, graphs, and equations. They also composed answers using data that they had recorded.  classRooM oBseRVations",40,mtms2009-12-268a,,
"As executed by this teacher, this bead-stringing activity gave students a concrete demonstration of the value of group work. Students realized that they needed to learn by working cooperatively. They also learned to experience assessment that was from more than one perspective. ",41,mtms2009-12-268a,,
"The teacher explained that just before the bead-stringing activities, students had taken a chapter test that covered plotting, graphing, and solving equations. Students were more successful on these beading activities than they were on the chapter test. When students were asked about these performance differences, they indicated that they could visualize what they were doing, so it made more sense. The teacher analyzed it in this way: ",42,mtms2009-12-268a,,
"Data and numerals were just symbols on the test, but on the activities a point like (1, 2) could be physically seen as representing 1 green bead and a total of 2 beads on the string. Also, the slope (e.g., 3/1) could easily be seen as showing that 1 green bead was strung for every 3 beads on the string. ",43,mtms2009-12-268a,,
"This teacher also commented that the bead activity was user-friendly because its emphasis on hands-on applications provided both recognition and acknowledgement of the kinesthetic needs of learners. When all these learning elements were combined, this application of linear functions gave students a challenging, yet supportive, context. Discussion was an essential element of a process that engaged students in a rich mathematical experience. ",44,mtms2009-12-268a,,
