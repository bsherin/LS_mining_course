0,Social Justice and Proportional Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Being a mathematically literate citizen requires daily applications of proportional reasoning, especially when answering such questions as these: Is the larger package a better buy? Is Chicago more dangerous than Detroit? Many of these applications, like the second question above, are related to social justice issues found in society. Mathematical story problems seen in textbooks are often contrived and only superficially deal with the real world and its complex issues. For example, the following Mixture problem is typically used when teaching ratios:",,
1,Social Justice and Proportional Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Juice mixture A has 3 parts water and 1 part fruit concentrate, while juice mixture B has 5 parts water and 2 parts fruit concentrate. Which mixture is fruitier?",,
2,Social Justice and Proportional Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Although this problem is certainly interesting and provides a convenient context for comparing ratios, it is not a problem that a student would genuinely be interested in solving. It also does not provide the student with new information about the world that he or she lives in.",,
3,Social Justice and Proportional Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The textbook approach to story problems no longer being sufficient can be seen from the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSM), which includes mathematical modeling, or apply[ing] the mathematics [students] know to solve problems arising in everyday life, society, and the workplace (CCSSI 2010, p. 7). This statement is one of eight essential mathematical practices at all grade levels. Ratio and proportional reasoning tasks abound that have connections to real-world situations. The document 6-7, Ratios and Proportional Relationship reinforces the importance of proportional reasoning in the mathematics curriculum. It emphasizes its many applications, such as finding trigonometric ratios and instantaneous rates of change in calculus, finding concentrations in chemical solutions, calculating tips, or analyzing descriptive statistics (Common Core Standards Writing Team 2011). Although extensive, this list of topics excludes a host of real-world situations in which the need for reasoning proportionally arises naturally, such as population growth, crime rates, incarceration rates, immigration rates, and other topics that provide valuable information about the world we live in.",,
4,Social Justice and Proportional Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In the two-part mathematics content course for preservice Kgrade 8 teachers that I teach, I frequently use authentic real-world contexts related to social justice. These contexts infuse the curriculum but do not replace mathematically rich problems without a realistic context. The social justice contexts introduce mathematical modeling through messy real-world problems that allow multiple strategies, typically both numerical and algebraic, and do not always use nice numbers.Items like the Mixture problem mentioned above allow for the introduction of other tools, like tables and diagrams, which typically do not occur naturally with real-world data. Both types of problems are needed in teacher education programs. In particular, social justice contexts help preservice teachers see mathematics and the world in a different light, which in turn will help them become better-informed teachers of mathematics.",,
5,Social Justice and Proportional Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In developing a social-justicebased curriculum, I sometimes create original problems, assignments, and lessons; at other times, I build on textbook materials. In this article, I will give a few examples of the latter. I will also show how effective a few simple actions, like including data from authentic sources and modifying contexts to be relevant to preservice teachers, can be in making the mathematics curriculum more realistic and thought-provoking.",,
6,Social Justice and Proportional Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,PROPORTIONAL REASONING PROBLEMS RELATED TO SOCIAL JUSTICE,,
7,Social Justice and Proportional Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Example 1: Population Growth and Crime Rates,,
8,Social Justice and Proportional Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The difference between additive comparisons (i.e., finding differences) and multiplicative comparisons (i.e., finding ratios), and the knowledge of when each is appropriately used, is one of the most important topics in proportional reasoning instruction (Lamon 2011). The examples in table 1 and table 2 were modified from the textbook used for the course (Sowder, Sowder, and Nickerson 2010). Both were already interesting problems addressing additive and multiplicative comparisons, and were almost authentic, except for using made-up numbers. Modifying them was simple: All that was needed in this case was to find regional information that would fit the demands of the problems.",,
9,Social Justice and Proportional Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
10,Social Justice and Proportional Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
11,Social Justice and Proportional Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The two cities in the modified problem in table 1 were chosen so that students would experience the same absolute growth during the same time period while having different starting populations. This information kept the mathematical demands of the modified problem similar, although not quite identical to those of the original problem, where it was easier to see different impacts of the growth (100 percent versus 1 percent). Conveniently, one of the cities featured in the modified example was Tacoma, where students attended classes; the other, Olympia, was only thirty miles away. These locales made the question relevant to preservice teachers, the vast majority of whom grew up in the region.",,
12,Social Justice and Proportional Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"This problem was discussed during class. Most preservice teachers correctly used both additive and multiplicative comparisons to argue that both answers to the question were correct, claiming that there were cases in which the starting population of the city was not relevant (e.g., when building a fixed number of housing units), and others in which it was (e.g., considering demands on the electric grid). Because the two cities were familiar to them, preservice teachers were also curious about the different growth rates of the two populations. They speculated that the city with a larger growth rate was more appealing to new residents.",,
13,Social Justice and Proportional Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I have used the problem in table 2on many occasions, sometimes as a homework assignment to introduce the unit on proportional reasoning. Perhaps because crime rates are reported regularly in the news, most preservice teachers immediately know that considering only the number of crimes without regard to population is problematic. When this problem was assigned as homework, all but one preservice teacher correctly used different facets of proportional reasoning to give the answer. However, this problem can still raise good questions about calculating rates. For example, one preservice teacher, reflecting what a middle school student might ponder, asked:",,
14,Social Justice and Proportional Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Am I assuming one inhabitant did one crime? Can one inhabitant do more than one crime? Can a noninhabitant commit a crime? Is the smaller ratio safer or is it safer to have a smaller number of crimes?,,
15,Social Justice and Proportional Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Many students showed conceptual understanding of ratios by using their own strategies rather than familiar algorithms, like the preservice teacher who concluded that [In King County], 1 in 4,100 people were victims of violent crime while in Thurston County, 1 in 653 people were victims. It was more than five times more dangerous!",,
16,Social Justice and Proportional Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Both examples provided contexts that were familiar and relevant to preservice teachers, especially as the cities and counties whose statistics were used are ones that many of them grew up in. Both show the importance of using rates when considering the impact of certain events (e.g. crime, population growth, number of cars) on a population.",,
17,Social Justice and Proportional Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Example 2: Race and Congress,,
18,Social Justice and Proportional Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The problem found in table 3 was adapted from the Selecting Delegates exploration in the Comparing and Scaling unit of the Connected Mathematics Project (Lappan et al. 2006). The original problem provided a table with the populations of each state, broken up by race/ethnicity and region. Students were tasked with choosing 1,000 delegates to fairly represent each region, and each race and ethnicity given in the table. This problem was mathematically rich and addressed fairness, but only abstractly, because the delegates were chosen not for a real function but for an imaginary function. Its modification included updating population information (see fig. 1a), and considering a very real example: the U.S. Congress, especially Senate, with its pronounced racial and ethnic inequality (see fig. 1b).",,
19,Social Justice and Proportional Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
20,Social Justice and Proportional Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
21,Social Justice and Proportional Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"This, like the previous problems, was open-ended enough for the preservice teachers to be able to use a variety of approaches when solving it, although the most common approach was to find and compare percentages. Special attention was paid to writing because preservice teachers will often find an answer to a problem but not think about its meaning or implications. As expected, preservice teachers were dismayed by the discrepancy between the results (see fig. 1), especially by the underrepresentation of Hispanics in both the U.S. House and Senate, and called for efforts to increase the diversity of elected representatives. Although there was not enough time to pursue these recommendations further, they would have provided an excellent entry point to related mathematics topics of redistricting and voting.",,
22,Social Justice and Proportional Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Example 3: Immigration,,
23,Social Justice and Proportional Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Although realistic and familiar contexts usually seem to make the mathematics easier to comprehend, they can also add confusion. Take the following unmodified example from Bassarear (2012). Given a table showing the United States immigration rate over the decades, from 1820 to 2000, preservice teachers were asked the following:",,
24,Social Justice and Proportional Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Make two separate line graphs, one using the total number and one using the rate per 1000 population. Describe the different impressions by the two graphs. Which graph do you think gives a better comparison of immigration to the United States? Why? (Bassarear 2012, p. 392).",,
25,Social Justice and Proportional Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"This problem also dealt with additive and multiplicative comparisons, but it was confusing to preservice teachers. The two graphs had different appearances: Although the immigration numbers had been growing steadily since the 1950s and had reached historic highs, immigration rates leveled off at a value much lower than those from the 1890s. With crime rates (see table 2), preservice teachers understood that total population size needed to be considered when examining the impact of the number of crimes committed. However, with immigration data, they overwhelmingly chose the first representation, using the total number as more accurate and disregarding the general population growth when examining the impact of the number of U.S. immigrants. Some preservice teachers claimed that the immigration rates were deceptive because they hid the raw numbers.",,
26,Social Justice and Proportional Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"This problem pointed to the importance of having conversations with students about the impact the same number of people or objects can have on populations of different sizes: Just because students understand this idea in one context does not mean that they will follow it in another context, especially one that is more controversial and polarizing, as is the case with immigration. Teachers can choose to focus exclusively on mathematics, and ask what the graphs are telling us about immigration rather than discuss students personal opinions about the issue.",,
27,Social Justice and Proportional Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,BENEFITS OF REAL-WORLD CONTEXTS,,
28,Social Justice and Proportional Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Preservice teachers appreciated real-world problems that dealt with issues they could relate to. The change to the curriculum that resulted in problem modifications was minimal, as the same mathematical content was addressed. All four examples shared here addressed topics that preservice teachers knew and had opinions about, and in some cases were personally invested in. This resulted in increased interest in the material being studied. In their reflections, most praised the applied nature of the proportional reasoning unit, strongly supporting the use of contextual problems in teaching mathematics. Many saw it as an added benefit: The mathematics learning was not replaced by the real-world issues, but, as a preservice teacher stated, Using these issues makes us figure out how to build the equation as well as how to see that math really is around us all the time.",,
29,Social Justice and Proportional Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,PROVIDING SOPHISTICATED MATHEMATICS,,
30,Social Justice and Proportional Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Most teachers already modify textbook problems, such as when they use their students names or change problem settings to resemble ones that are familiar to their students. However, teachers are less likely to adapt problems to include more difficult issues like crime or immigration, possibly because they fear that their students are not ready for or would not understand those issues. Work with Kgrade 8 students, especially those from marginalized backgrounds, has repeatedly shown that young students are not only aware of the issues that people and communities face but also ready to use sophisticated mathematics to make sense of them (Simic-Muller, Varley Gutierrez, and Turner 2009; Gutstein 2005; Varley Gutierrez 2013). Preservice and in-service teachers alike should therefore seriously consider incorporating these relevant, authentic topics into their teaching.",,
31,Social Justice and Proportional Reasoning - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Modifying textbook problems to include social justice contexts is not difficult. For example, if a problem asks about a percentage increase of the price of notebooks, why not instead look at food price increase or compare markups in urban and suburban grocery stores? The mathematical content is already present in the textbooks; it is only the plausibility of the context that needs to be added.",,
