"My son still remembers, at recess in elementary school, watching high school students fire rockets during their physics class. He could not wait to get into that teacher’s class. My middle school students anticipated, with similar eagerness, the arrival of my graduate student, whose lessons they were able to relate to their own lives. These lessons, often referred to as “high-impact activities,” promote  2006; Pape 2003). We hope that our activities have a similar impact and inspire students to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM).  thinking can be linked to the engineering design process.",3,mtms2013-02-332a,,

"Stoner, and I participated in a threeyear K-grade 12 STEM project funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF). We were on one of eight teams, each consisting of a Lehigh University, Pennsylvania, graduate student and one or two public school teachers. A Lehigh University profes- high-retention learning. Recent  research suggests that high-impact  activities in science and math  classes promote positive   sor was the team leader. Each team focused on a specific STEM career path. Our mathematics team developed several goals; the primary goal was the development of high-impact lessons that would pique the interest of our eighth-grade students and encourage them to pursue STEM careers. We decided that all lessons should follow a theme, include handson activities, and incorporate students’ current or past experiences. ",7,mtms2013-02-332a,,
"Designing lessons around a specific  theme permitted easy integration of STEM concepts while maintaining  the students’ level of interest. The first year of the grant happened to coincide with the construction of our energyefficient middle school. As a result, the visual aid of the construction site was of interest to the students and allowed us to demonstrate the practical application of mathematics.",8,mtms2013-02-332a,,
"For the first lesson, we asked  students to brainstorm ways that math might play a role in a construction project. Subsequent lessons addressed these essential construction questions:  •	 How	much	dirt	must	be	removed	 from a construction site?  •	 How	many	trucks	are	needed	to	 remove it?  •	 Are	the	current	stairways	constructed to code?  •	 Are	the	walls	at	right	angles	to	  the floor? ",9,mtms2013-02-332a,,
"The culminating Scale Model Project, described below, involved creating a scale model of the new building.",10,mtms2013-02-332a,,
"During the second year of the  grant, the math team designed lessons using an amusement park theme. Many of the activities focused on typical amusement park rides such as the carousel, the Ferris wheel, and the roller coaster, with specific references to rides at the local amusement park. Focusing on the concept of motion, we structured lessons to teach topics such as distance as a function of rate and time, circular motion (of a Ferris wheel), relative speed (on a carousel), and scale models (of skate park elements). The students were especially engaged by the physical models that were constructed from traditional toys, which were used to analyze the motion and behavior of various rides. The culminating project was the creation of a scale version of the local skate park that was being designed and built. ",11,mtms2013-02-332a,,
"The graduate student, with assistance from the classroom teacher, ",12,mtms2013-02-332a,,

designed hands-on activities that encouraged students to explore a targeted math concept that related to the theme. These lessons incorporated a strategy based on posing questions related to the engineering design process. The questions we posed were designed to lead students through the problem-solving process.,14,mtms2013-02-332a,,
"The lessons were implemented in a variety of eighth-grade classrooms. Some students were below grade level, and others were studying advanced algebra. We anticipated that the lessons would take one to two forty-fiveminute class periods. To justify the time spent, activities were tailored to current classroom objectives. Students were very engaged in these types of activities and would often request that we do them more often. The projects involving scale models required more time; we dedicated at least four or five class periods (during state testing  time) to the construction of the  models. However, these projects seemed to have the most impact. In a class filled with students who would routinely disengage or cause disruption, we had a room filled with students who were designing and creating. They were also interested in the experiences and opinions of community members who joined us. I was truly surprised by the change in their engagement.",15,mtms2013-02-332a,,
scale Model Project,16,mtms2013-02-332a,,
"We tied the themed lessons together with a project that asked students to use the engineering design process to create a final product. We accomplished this by designing a scale model project that could be adapted to fit our two themes: a redesign of our school and a nearby skateboard park. In essence, the graduate student found a construction project (this could also be a current building or park) that was relevant to the students and contacted the architect or builders. If you do not have access to a contractor or architect, finding specifications of a park or building would work as well. In addition, local college students studying to be architects or engineers could be contacted through local engineering societies or by contacting college departments.",17,mtms2013-02-332a,,
"The graduate student segmented  a large blueprint into pieces of the project that students would be able to construct. It made sense for the school blueprint structure to be divided into three rectangular buildings. The blueprints for the skate park were broken into individual elements, such as the half pipe, a ramp, steps, and so on. We then gave students a drawing of the building and the element, including the real-life dimensions from the blueprints. In the case of the school, each group had the same drawing; with the skate park, each group had a different element from the park. ",18,mtms2013-02-332a,,
"These activities were designed   to elicit student thinking about  measurements, ratios, and proportional thinking. Figure 1 is the activity given to students, in addition to their building blueprint. Students addressed ratio, used proportional thinking, and finetuned their measuring skills and choice of proper units. Students used the engineering design process throughout the project as they analyzed decisions and adjusted their models.",19,mtms2013-02-332a,,
School Building,20,mtms2013-02-332a,,
"The class was not given a specified ratio against which to scale a model of their school building. However, they were instructed to make their models fit on a piece of 3 ft. × 3 ft. cardboard. Students struggled to get started with such little direction and structure. We led them through the engineering design process by asking questions. Articulating what they were being asked to do defined the problem; articulating what we knew about the scale model focused the students’ attention. It helped them make connections to what they needed to know to make the scale model. The following specific questions allowed students to make these connections: •	 What	are	the	restrictions	for	your	 model? •	 How	do	they	effect	your	  measurements? •	 What	if	one	part	of	the	building	 does not fit on the board?  •	 How	can	you	make	sure	that	the	 building will fit? •	 How	do	we	ensure	that	the	sizes	 are all scaled?  •	 What	does	it	mean	to	have	scaled	 measurements?",21,mtms2013-02-332a,,
The next step was to select a  strategy for building the scale model. Some groups began by deciding how large they wanted a piece of the building to be so that it fit on the board. ,22,mtms2013-02-332a,,
"Fig. 1 this project required students to draw on their experience with ratio and proportion. in the process, their measuring skills were fine-tuned.",23,mtms2013-02-332a,,
little architects,24,mtms2013-02-332a,,
"Architects and contractors use models to show their employers a threedimensional version of their building. Everything in the model, from walls to cars, is in correct proportion and is scaled in the same way to the actual building. You are challenged to create a scale model of a section of the proposed skate park or school. the dimensions and general shape of your structure are listed below. Your task is to scale down each dimension and build a three-dimensional model.",25,mtms2013-02-332a,,
Your project must include the following: 1. A three-dimensional model of your structure.,26,mtms2013-02-332a,,
2. A neatly written report containing dimensions of the model and the   calculations that accompany the numbers.  3. the names of the people in your group.,27,mtms2013-02-332a,,
We will eventually combine all elements to form our own model of the skate park.,28,mtms2013-02-332a,,

"They used that ratio to scale the remainder of the measurements. While building their scale models, some groups found that their strategy did not take into account the restriction of the size of cardboard. In the test and redesign phase, they resolved the dilemma in one of two ways: starting over or making their board bigger, which meant they lost points. Students were required to communicate their results by including with their models a report that explained their measurements, why those measurements were chosen, and how they were obtained. ",32,mtms2013-02-332a,,
Skate Park Model,33,mtms2013-02-332a,,
"We asked students to bring skateboards to class. We also purchased finger skateboards to complete the  project. In groups, students measured their boards (either full size or finger size), and we discussed constructing a ratio so that our models would be scaled to the size of the finger boards. Students used this ratio to scale their measurements and to begin building their models. Many tried various structural ideas before committing to one plan. ",34,mtms2013-02-332a,,
"To conclude this activity, we invited to our classroom the three people in the community most connected with the project: the architect who designed the park, the park recreation coordinator, and the owner of a local skate shop. Fortunately, many students knew these people in the community from other experiences. These three individuals spent a few minutes with each group and their completed  models to discuss the pros and cons of their projects. They judged the models, awarded prizes, and discussed future career options. Students responded well to hearing community members whom they respected telling them that school is important and that successful careers are attainable. It was a wonderful experience for all involved.",35,mtms2013-02-332a,,
Ferris Wheels and carousels,36,mtms2013-02-332a,,
"One topic we covered was distance, speed, and time as they related to  circular motion. A K’nex© Ferris Wheel was used to conduct miniexperiments. We timed rotations  and used geometric formulas for circumference and area to calculate the rotational speed of the rider in a specific car of a Ferris wheel (see  fig. 2). Students then generalized their results and applied their understanding to a carousel by determining which horse on a carousel (if there were three rows) traveled the fastest (see fig. 3). Students made predictions and then used calculations to either support their hypothesis or refute it. This activity was designed in two parts to encourage students to think about formulas and the behavior of the components of the formula. It also incorporated averages and geometry concepts of diameter, radius, circumference, measurement, and rate of speed.",37,mtms2013-02-332a,,
"As a class, we discussed the idea of the speed of the rider on a Ferris wheel using the questions below to define the problem and determine background knowledge:  •	 To	calculate	the	speed	of	the	rider,	 what do we need to know?  •	 What	formula	are	you	familiar	 with that we could use?  •	 How	do	we	figure	out	the	distance	 and time elements in relation to the rider?",38,mtms2013-02-332a,,

Students needed to determine the speed of the rider. We were able to facilitate students’ thought processes by using the traditional formula: distance = rate × time,46,mtms2013-02-332a,,
"Students immediately suggested measuring the time it took to complete one revolution of the Ferris wheel. However, they also wanted to measure the circumference of the  Ferris wheel to determine distance. ",47,mtms2013-02-332a,,
Fig. 3 this task required students to generalize their results and apply their understanding by determining which horse travels the fastest on a carousel.,48,mtms2013-02-332a,,
"around and around We go the carousel is one of the oldest rides at an amusement park. the carousel at the local amusement park dates back to the 1920s; however, one model dates back to 1901. consider a carousel with 3 horses in each row, 1 horse on the outside, 1 horse on the inside, and 1 horse in the middle. the horses are 2 feet apart. the inside horse is 10 feet from the center of the carousel’s circle, and the carousel rotates once every minute.  1. if you wanted to ride the fastest horse, which would you choose? 2. how did you arrive at your conclusion?",49,mtms2013-02-332a,,
"They soon realized that using a ruler was incredibly difficult and that  they had to find a better way. They  suggested measuring both the radius and the diameter. Stoner allowed students to follow their ideas, make mistakes, and correct their strategies. The most important part of the engineering design process involves allowing students time to apply mathematical concepts, to test their strategies, and to ask themselves if their conclusions made sense.",50,mtms2013-02-332a,,
"Three students each measured the radius of the Ferris wheel and used a stopwatch to record the time it took for the rider to complete one revolution. The class discussed which data should be used to calculate the speed. After a few suggestions, students concluded that we could incorporate all three items for distance and speed if they were averaged. We then calculated the average speed of the rider and confirmed that it made sense.",51,mtms2013-02-332a,,
"Next, students were given the  “Around and Around We Go” carousel task (see fig. 3). They had varying levels of success, and stumbling blocks varied within the class. Some students had difficulty identifying where to start the problem; others connected this problem to the Ferris wheel but did not know how to find the radius of each horse’s path because they were given relative to one another. ",52,mtms2013-02-332a,,
"As students struggled with the carousel problem, we asked some questions, which followed the engineering design process, to focus their thinking:  •	 What	are	you	being	asked? •	 What	information	do	you	need	  to answer the question? •	 What	information	is	given	in	  the problem? •	 How	does	the	Ferris	wheel	  problem relate to this one? •	 Can	you	draw	a	picture	and	label	  it to represent the situation?",53,mtms2013-02-332a,,
"Often while facilitating, I would encourage students to explain their thinking or their approach to help them further their ideas. It is important to let students structure the problem and solve it creatively in their own way. Student solutions varied slightly, with most students drawing and labeling a picture, finding the radius of each horse, calculating the circumference and then speed of each horse, and comparing the speeds to make a decision.",54,mtms2013-02-332a,,
"One or two students began to  construct the relationships between the quantities in the speed formula. They noticed that the horses all traveled the same amount of time, so the distance was what changed from horse to horse. The horse that traveled the farthest distance had the highest speed. Students  who did not use calculations to support their answers were asked to write their thinking process in a way that would convince their peers of their solution and connect it to the calculations. ",55,mtms2013-02-332a,,
"We did not differentiate the problem but instead gave it to the students with no structure. However, the problem can be broken down into steps that will lead students to the answer. For example, you can include a diagram with three concentric circles representing the paths of three horses and ask students to label them. The following questions can lead them toward the goal of determining the fastest horse.",56,mtms2013-02-332a,,

These steps involved identifying current knowledge, defining what you want to know, choosing a solution process (creating a solution or choosing a problem-solving strategy), and communicating the results. In these lessons, students explored ideas by taking measurements, collecting data, and analyzing the data using their mathematics skills.",70,mtms2013-02-332a,,
"In a subsequent class, we discussed  students’ findings, examined why some results were slightly different, and encouraged students to make connections. Although we did not point out this fact to the students, the steps of the engineering process were implemented in each activity. The final step—communicating the results—entailed writing a summary of the process, explaining why the answer made sense or why a particular strategy was used to solve the problem.",71,mtms2013-02-332a,,
"The use of themes derived from  familiar aspects of students’ lives enabled us to infuse STEM concepts  into our rigid curriculum. Examples of lessons that we used are discussed here. We implemented this approach into structured activities by using a questioning technique similar to the engineering design process.
