Homework: How Much  Help Is Enough?,1,mtms2009-12-292a,,
"Last night, I watched my son complete his homework. I thought he could have done a neater job. I also saw that some of his answers were wrong. I didn’t say anything and just let him turn it in. Should parents help with homework? If so, to what degree?",2,mtms2009-12-292a,,
"Many parents are not sure what role they should play in their child’s education beyond dropping them off at school and checking their grades. They often receive mixed messages, “I don’t know what I’m supposed to do in class but please don’t talk to my teacher. I’ll be too embarrassed.” In addition, for some parents the content level has reached a point where they cannot provide enough information to help with a particular assignment.",3,mtms2009-12-292a,,
"Adolescents definitely need parental support to be successful. The more support that children have for school, the greater their success, regardless of race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, or parents’ level of education. It can be challenging for parents to get to know different teachers while navigating through the different expectations that arise in middle school. Teachers can help by being explicit about the role that homework plays in a student’s grade, frequency and type of assignments, and the ways that parents can help if their child is having difficulty.",4,mtms2009-12-292a,,

"Teachers vary in their opinions of the weight given to homework. For some, it constitutes a small portion of a grade; for others, homework is significant. It often depends on whether it is seen as being a reinforcement of study skills, a vehicle for practice, or adherence to school policy. The key is for teachers to communicate to students and parents early in the school year how they will assess homework.",6,mtms2009-12-292a,,

"Mastering a concept requires practice and repetition. A teacher’s role is to structure that practice so that students can build on what they know and connect the knowledge to a new context. If the concept is confusing, a teacher needs to clarify it. Homework composed of material previously taught and items from upcoming lessons is more effective than problems from the day’s lesson. This might require modifying the textbook pages or assigning problems from different sections. Parents who are monitoring their child’s homework will have a sense of what they have mastered and what type of problems they will be facing. ",8,mtms2009-12-292a,,
"Questions should be asked that require students to tap into higher-order thinking skills. Answering questions allows students to reflect on what they know and to synthesize the information. Too often, students are asked questions from the lower cognitive levels, such as merely recalling facts or matching definitions. After assigning  questions, provide time for students to talk with peers. This models the advantage of working together on assignments and can prevent parents from hearing this common statement at home, “I don’t know what I’m supposed to do.” ",9,mtms2009-12-292a,,

"All parents want their children to succeed, but many do not have the tools or resources to aid in their success. Parents need to understand that they do not have to provide the instruction and that there are ways they can help. Teachers can help parents by— •	 providing	a	list	of	questions	that	 parents can ask if their child is having difficulty. What information do you know? Can you break the problem into parts? Would it help to draw a diagram? What assumptions are you making?  •	 encouraging	parents	to	ask	about	the	 assignment, due dates, and how the studying is going. Children often need assistance balancing assignments from multiple teachers; their social calendars; and long-term assignments, quizzes, and tests.",11,mtms2009-12-292a,,

Asking your child to think about the work that he or she has done or is about to do will help with success in homework and in class.  online Research,17,mtms2009-12-292a,,
Many resources are available to help your child if he or she is struggling in math. Communities and schools often have homework clubs. Speak with other parents about resources they may know about in the community. Ask the teacher what the school offers for students who are having difficulty.,18,mtms2009-12-292a,,

Here are a few Internet resources to help your middle school child begin traveling the road to  independence and self-reliance in terms of his or her math homework.",19,mtms2009-12-292a,,

"Consider the first part of your question. Should you help your middle school children with their homework? The answer is yes and no. Yes, you should, but only as you help them transition from years of help with homework in elementary school to independence in middle school. The transition pace may vary, but we are working toward a bigger prize than just good grades. You are striving for independence, self-reliance, and confidence.",21,mtms2009-12-292a,,
"The second part of the question is a little more complex. To what degree should you help? In middle school, students suddenly experience more academic stress at the same time that they are experiencing physiological, emotional, and psychological changes. It is a time of learning to be an individual while they are still dependent on you. ",22,mtms2009-12-292a,,

"It is important that we understand the effects of rescuing children from their behaviors. Saving them from their mistakes keeps them from truly owning their successes or fully understanding the consequences of their choices. An enduring result of rescuing is that you never get to establish a relationship that acknowledges their ability to act or be independent of our assistance. The message to them should be this: “I’m always here for you, but I trust that you can handle this.”  achieVing sUccess You can work with your child to create a new positive self-driven dynamic about homework by—  •	 organizing	a	work	or	study	space;	 •	 providing	supplies	such	as	graph	 paper, pencils, a graphing calculator, a dictionary, a metric and standard ruler, and a student planner; •	 asking	about	your	child’s	system	 for keeping track of assignments and progress;  •	 encouraging	or	hosting	a	study	 group (collaborate with other parents) or finding a study buddy for your child to call; •	 having	consistently	high	expectations for your child; •	 establishing	homework	as	a	priority in the household; and   •	 asking	to	see	the	completed	work	 and inquiring about it.",24,mtms2009-12-292a,,

"When a student gets stuck on a problem, it is tempting to show or tell him or her how to solve it. However, think about the results that you are seeking, such as independence, confidence, and the ability to construct meaning. Build on in-class experiences by asking your child to review class notes. You can help by posing these questions: •	 What	do	you	need	to	find	out? •	 What	part	of	the	problem	do	you	 understand? •	 Where	did	you	and	where	can	you	 begin? •	 What	steps	have	you	taken? •	 How	can	the	information	be	orga- nized, modeled, or illustrated?",26,mtms2009-12-292a,,
