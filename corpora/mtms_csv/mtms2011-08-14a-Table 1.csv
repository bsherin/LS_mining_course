"We had just finished a Thanksgiving meal last year, and several family members were relaxing on the front porch. I sat on the swing next to my eight-year-old niece. “What interesting things have you been learning in school recently?” I asked. She told me that she had been learning her multiplication tables. As a former math teacher and elementary teacher, I was pleased that she considered learning math to be interesting. ",3,mtms2011-08-14a,,
"I asked her if she was familiar with the trick of doing the 9s table on her fingers. Yes, she knew that one. Then I asked if she knew about doing the higher facts for 6s up through 10s on her fingers. She had not heard about that particular trick, so I explained it to her:  Turn your hands palm up toward you. Assign the number 6 to your thumbs, 7 to your index fingers, and on up, so that 10 is assigned to your pinky fingers (see fig. 1). Choose a multiplication problem such that both factors are a number from 6 to 10. Touch together the two fingers that have those assigned numbers. Then,   •  Starting with the tens digit,  count the number of fingers that ",4,mtms2011-08-14a,,

Fig. 1 Number your fingers in this manner for the multiplication trick to work.,6,mtms2011-08-14a,,
"are between you and the fingers that are touching, including the two that are touching.  •  For the units digit, multiply the  number of left-hand fingers beyond the touching fingers times the number of right-hand fingers beyond the touching fingers.   Add the number of tens and the units amount for the answer to your multiplication problem. If the units amount is 10 or greater, add the “carry” to the tens amount.",7,mtms2011-08-14a,,
"Here is a step-by-step example of  how this trick works using 7 × 8:  1.  Touch your left pointer finger to  your right middle finger. (See  fig. 2a.) 2.  Including the touching fingers, you have 5 fingers between you ",8,mtms2011-08-14a,,
"Fig. 2 To get the result of any multiplication when each factor is from 6 to 10, use your fingers to find the tens and the units digits of the product.",9,mtms2011-08-14a,,
(a) 7 × 8 (b) 6 × 6,10,mtms2011-08-14a,,
Fig 3 Stephen explained why the problem works.,11,mtms2011-08-14a,,
"6  7  8  9  10 factors being multiplied      X =  1  2  3  4   5  left-hand fingers     Y =  1  2  3  4   5  right-hand fingers    Let X be 5 less than the left-hand factor we are multiplying.  Let Y be 5 less than the right-hand factor we are multiplying. For the formula, our fingers are now numbered 1–5, instead of 6–0.",12,mtms2011-08-14a,,
"Formula: 10X + 10Y + (5 – X)(5 – Y) = answer example: If we are doing 8 × 6, then X = 3 and Y = 1: 10(3) + 10(1) + (5 – 3)(5 – 1) = 48",13,mtms2011-08-14a,,
Why it works:                                10X + 10Y + (5 – X )(5 – Y) = answer 10X + 10Y + 25 – 5X – 5Y + XY = answer                                           25 + 5X + 5Y + XY = answer                                                   (5 + X)(5 + Y) = answer,14,mtms2011-08-14a,,
"We originally assigned X and Y to be 5 less than the numbers we were  multiplying, so our formula takes that into account.",15,mtms2011-08-14a,,
"and those fingers. That gives you 5 tens, or 50. You have 3 left-hand fingers beyond the touching  fingers and 2 right-hand fingers, or 3 × 2 = 6.  3.  Add that number, 6, to the 50,  which is 56, the answer to 7 × 8. ",16,mtms2011-08-14a,,
"I demonstrated this process with several more examples. “I think that trick is pretty amazing!” I concluded. “I only learned it two or three years ago, and I have no idea why it works.”",17,mtms2011-08-14a,,
"Others on the porch had been listening, and agreed it was really cool. My son, Stephen, said, “There’s got to be a mathematical reason for it. I’m going to figure out why it works.” He went inside to get paper and pencil from Aunt Marilyn. ",18,mtms2011-08-14a,,
"He triumphantly returned after solving the mystery and showed me the sheet that contained his calcula- tions. He had produced a page of simple algebra (see fig. 3). Stephen said that Uncle Bill had wondered if the process would work for other bases. “I don’t understand what you mean,” I said.",19,mtms2011-08-14a,,
"Stephen gave me an example. Suppose you have only 8 fingers instead of 10. For the sake of illustration, do not use your thumbs. Then the other fingers would be numbered  5eight, 6eight, 7eight, and 10eight.",20,mtms2011-08-14a,,
Try          6eight × 7eight. ,21,mtms2011-08-14a,,
"Touch those fingers together. We have five  10eight front fingers + (1eight × 2eight)  back fingers. That gives  52eight, which equals 42ten. ",22,mtms2011-08-14a,,
"This trick works for that example, as well.",23,mtms2011-08-14a,,
"Does it work for every example  in base eight? Can you prove it mathematically? How about for base twelve? (If trying this trick in base twelve, work with a friend who will provide the extra two fingers.) Does it work for all bases? If not, which ones do not work?",24,mtms2011-08-14a,,
"Perhaps your students would like to explore some of these questions, as well as the original mystery question that Stephen solved. Your students might find them fun, too.",25,mtms2011-08-14a,,
