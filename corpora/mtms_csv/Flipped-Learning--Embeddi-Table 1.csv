5,Flipped Learning: Embedding Questions in Videos,"More teachers are trying out the fl ipped classroom model in which content is delivered outside of class time, typically through online videos and “homework,” and follow-up activities are done in class. This model frees up more class time for inquiry and discussion. Survey results show that the percentage of teachers who indicated that they had fl ipped a lesson during the school year increased from 48 percent in 2012 to 78 percent in 2014 (cited in Yarbro et al. 2014). ",5,Flipped Learning: Embedding Questions in Videos
6,Flipped Learning: Embedding Questions in Videos,"Articles on fl ipped instruction  suggest such benefi ts as (1) freeing up class time for meaningful  activities and formative assessment; (2) increasing student engagement, motivation, and content knowledge; and (3) offering slower learners the opportunity to pause, rewind, and review segments of videos (Bergmann =and Sams 2012; Moore, Gillett, and Steele 2014; Tucker 2012). The fl ipped model gains traction because of the availability of online videos such as those produced by Khan Academy and LearnZillion. However, the fl ipped model is ineffective if it is implemented as “a high-tech version of an antiquated instructional method: the lecture” (Ash 2012). ",6,Flipped Learning: Embedding Questions in Videos
7,Flipped Learning: Embedding Questions in Videos,"Studies of the effect that fl ipped  instruction has had on student achievement show mixed results. In particular, Yong, Levy, and Lape (2015) did not fi nd signifi cant differences in student learning between fl ipped sections and interactive-lecture sections at Harvey Mudd College. In a study involving 11 sections of college algebra, Overmyer (2015) found that students of instructors using inquiry-based learning performed better in the common fi nal exam. Jensen, Kummer, and Godoy (2015) found that it was an active learning mode rather than the fl ipped classroom that contributed to higher learning gains. Active learning in class requires students to self-learn the content within their individual learning spaces so that they are ready to apply what they have learned to solve problems independently and collaboratively in class. This article focuses on the selflearning portion of the fl ipped learning model, in particular, increasing students’ intellectual engagement by requiring them to answer embedded questions as they watch math videos.

9,Flipped Learning: Embedding Questions in Videos,"A teacher who plans to fl ip his or her classroom may either search for an appropriate video for a topic or create a video. The advantages of a teacher- made video include the teacher’s control over the mathematics content, the fl exibility to pitch at a level best suited for the teacher’s students, students’ affi nity for their teacher, and consistency in style and delivery. Advantages of using an open-source video include using the “best” available video for a particular concept, exposing students to different teachers and various teaching styles, saving the time it would take to create a video, and, possibly, expanding the teacher’s knowledge of teaching. In general, a teacher may begin by fi rst looking for an appropriate video or online resource. If there is not a video that meets both the lesson objectives and the students’ needs, then the teacher can create his or her own video. ",9,Flipped Learning: Embedding Questions in Videos
10,Flipped Learning: Embedding Questions in Videos,"There are numerous instructional videos on learning mathematics available on the Internet for free access. Video-management websites, such as Edpuzzle, Zaption, and eduCanon, enable teachers either to create video lessons from public videos (e.g., YouTube, Khan Academy, Vimeo) or  to create their own original videos. These websites offer various features, such as cropping, question embedding, and student performance tracking. The question-embedding feature allows teachers to insert questions for students to answer as they watch the video and automatically scores students’ responses for forced-choice items. The class-management feature allows teachers to keep track of assigned videos, grade open-response items, review students’ performance, and download student scores.

18,Flipped Learning: Embedding Questions in Videos,"After creating more than 500 embedded questions and reviewing the questions and comments embedded by other users, Lim found that questions or comments can be embedded for three general purposes: (1) to enhance students’ learning of the information presented in the video, (2) to assess students’ understanding of what they are watching, and (3) to give instructions while students are watching the video. Most of the embedded questions in math videos, as of summer 2014, were for assessment and instruction purposes. Consequently, Lim wrote his own questions and embedded them to enhance student learning with the videos used in his courses. ",18,Flipped Learning: Embedding Questions in Videos
19,Flipped Learning: Embedding Questions in Videos,"A question or comment can be  embedded at any point on the video timeline.

22,Flipped Learning: Embedding Questions in Videos,advantage of forced-choice items is that they can be automatically graded and scored by the video-management software program. Another advantage is that it takes less time for the student to respond and to resume the flow of the video. It is therefore less disruptive to the student.,22,Flipped Learning: Embedding Questions in Videos
23,Flipped Learning: Embedding Questions in Videos,"Questions can be embedded to  help students gain different types of knowledge. On the basis of a preliminary analysis of 89 embedded questions in 21 videos on geometry and measurement, five types of embedded questions have been identified. Please note that the term “students” presented in the following discussion refers to prospective teachers and not middle school students. ",23,Flipped Learning: Embedding Questions in Videos

26,Flipped Learning: Embedding Questions in Videos,"When a question is posed in the video, the same question can be embedded to force students to think about it. For example, in a Math Antics video on angles, students will see the size of an angle of 1 degree; hear, “You might wonder if there can be any angle smaller than 1 degree”; and  then answer the yes/no question,  “Can there be any angle smaller than 1 degree?” Students who think in  terms of whole numbers can learn from their mistakes that measurements can take fractional values.",26,Flipped Learning: Embedding Questions in Videos

30,Flipped Learning: Embedding Questions in Videos,"In other situations, the teacher  can pose a question to draw students’ attention to a related idea and help them make connections. For example, after hearing that two lines point exactly in the same direction, as shown in figure 1, students are asked to infer a characteristic of parallel lines.",30,Flipped Learning: Embedding Questions in Videos
31,Flipped Learning: Embedding Questions in Videos,Procedural Knowledge and Skills,31,Flipped Learning: Embedding Questions in Videos
32,Flipped Learning: Embedding Questions in Videos,"Numerous videos illustrate how to solve certain problems, but not many explain the concepts underlying the procedure. For example, the presenter in a Math Antics video describes the cross-multiplication method for comparing 7/8 and 4/5 but does not explain how 35 and 28 are related to the two fractions. A question can be embedded to draw students’ attention to the meaning of 35 and 28. That is, if we are multiplying both fractions, 7/8 and 4/5, by some form of the number 1 (i.e., 5/5 and 8/8, respectively), then we are actually using the common denominator and comparing 35/40 and 28/40. On the other hand, if we are multiplying both fractions by 40, then we are indeed comparing 35 units and 28 units, which are not equivalent to 7/8 unit and 4/5 unit. ",32,Flipped Learning: Embedding Questions in Videos
33,Flipped Learning: Embedding Questions in Videos,"In certain situations, questions can be posed to engage students to anticipate a step just before it is presented in the video. The embedded question in figure 2 asks students to think about the unit fraction that is appropriate for converting 240 minutes into seconds. This way, students get to engage with the ideas presented in the video instead of passively watching how a procedure is used to solve a routine problem.

35,Flipped Learning: Embedding Questions in Videos,"Certain concepts are epistemologically challenging for students because they may have multiple interpretations. For example, a quantity can be represented by different fractions depending on the referent for the fraction. In figure 3, the red region, which represents 3/5  of a piece of paper, can also be represented as 3/4 of something. The embedded question forces students to pay attention to the referent 3/4 by reflecting on the question and thinking about the answer before listening to the explanation presented in the video. The follow-up question in figure 4 reinforces students’ understanding that  3/5 of a whole is equal to 3/4 of 4/5 of the same whole; indirectly, it asks students to relate the two fractions symbolically, that is, 3/5 = 3/4 × 4/5. Among 40 prospective teachers,  30 percent selected the correct answer,  30 percent chose “3/5 = 3/4,” and  18 percent chose “All the other statements are incorrect.” Embedded questions offer students an opportunity to learn from their errors.",35,Flipped Learning: Embedding Questions in Videos

37,Flipped Learning: Embedding Questions in Videos,"Learning the solution to a problem without comprehending the problem is fruitless. The embedded question in figure 5 forces students to think about what the problem asks. Among  18 prospective teachers, only 44 percent realized that the problem is about finding the height of the triangle with AC and not BC as the base. It is interesting that 39 percent thought that the problem was about differentiating between altitude and height. ",37,Flipped Learning: Embedding Questions in Videos

39,Flipped Learning: Embedding Questions in Videos,"Problem solving inevitably involves reasoning and sense making because a solution approach to a problem, unlike a routine exercise, is not readily known to students. A question embedded in a video on how to solve a problem can help students think about the key idea related to its solution. For example, the solution for the problem in figure 5 involves finding the area of the triangle in two ways. The embedded question in figure 6 draws students’ attention to a particular piece of information, namely, that angle B is a right angle, which is necessary to solve the  ",39,Flipped Learning: Embedding Questions in Videos

Among 15 prospective teachers, only 27 percent chose the correct answer. Yet 40 percent chose “the distance XC by subtracting AX from 5 units,” probably without realizing that it is even more diffi cult to fi nd the length AX. Another 27 percent chose “the distance BX using the Pythagorean theorem,” probably indiscriminately associating the right triangle with the Pythagorean theorem.",43,Flipped Learning: Embedding Questions in Videos
44,Flipped Learning: Embedding Questions in Videos,"Sense-making questions can be  embedded to draw students’ attention to certain ideas, assumptions, or expressions. For example, the question in fi gure 7 reinforces student understanding that the area of an acute  triangle can be found by cutting it into two right triangles. It also fosters a particular kind of mathematical thinking—complex ideas are typically built using simpler ideas. The question in fi gure 8 asks students to think about the reason for factoring out the h/2. This question fosters goal-oriented thinking, which in this case is to simplify an expression with a goal in mind, that is, to show that the area of the triangle is bh/2. The question in fi gure 9 asks students for the meaning of the product h • AC in the expression h(AC)/2.

53,Flipped Learning: Embedding Questions in Videos,"As users of other people’s videos, teachers have no control over the information presented. Embedded questions allow teachers to enhance student learning by including additional information related to the content of the video. For example, the question in fi gure 1 helps students learn that parallel lines not only “point in the same direction” but also will never meet. Teachers can embed questions  before or after a piece of information is presented in the video. Posing an embedded question before the video presentation can— a.  prepare students for what is to  come by drawing on prior knowledge (e.g., fi g. 6); b.  allow students to make a prediction and learn from mistakes (e.g., fi gs. 2 and 3); or c.  provide an opportunity for students  to practice thinking and problem solving (e.g., fi g. 6). ",53,Flipped Learning: Embedding Questions in Videos
54,Flipped Learning: Embedding Questions in Videos,"Alternatively, a question can be embedded immediately after an idea is presented in the video to— a.  ensure comprehension of the  idea (e.g., fi g. 3);  b.  encourage thinking about the idea in greater depth (e.g., fi gs. 1 and 4); c.  make connections  (e.g., fi gs. 1 and 4), or  d.  provide practice in applying a  newly learned idea (e.g., fi g. 2). ",54,Flipped Learning: Embedding Questions in Videos
55,Flipped Learning: Embedding Questions in Videos,"An embedded question inevitably breaks the fl ow of the video and may  disrupt students’ train of thought. When considering whether to embed a particular question, teachers may think about their responses to these questions:  •  What is the purpose of embedding  this question?  •  How does this embedded question  increase student engagement or enhance student learning? •  Will it enhance—or break—the  students’ flow of thoughts in relation to the idea presented in the video? ",55,Flipped Learning: Embedding Questions in Videos
56,Flipped Learning: Embedding Questions in Videos,"If a question is embedded solely for assessing student understanding, then the question may be better posed after students have watched the video rather than while they are watching it. If a question is embedded to increase student engagement, then teachers may consider whether students would find the question interesting and not too overwhelming. Teachers may need to consider the tension between fostering positive affect toward learning (e.g., posing straightforward questions that most students would answer correctly and feel good about their learning) and enhancing mathematical learning (e.g., posing challenging questions that would deepen student understanding). If a question is embedded to enhance student learning, then teachers would need to identify the aspect of mathematical knowledge (factual, procedural, conceptual) or thinking (task comprehension, reasoning, sense making, problem solving) at which the question is directed. On the one hand, thinkingoriented questions can enhance students’ process skills; on the other hand, such questions are more likely to break the flow of ideas presented in the video.",56,Flipped Learning: Embedding Questions in Videos

58,Flipped Learning: Embedding Questions in Videos,"When we started using math videos in fall 2014, we found that the embedded questions, created by Edpuzzle users  who are mainly math teachers, were mostly intended to help students remember something that was presented in the video or solve a similar problem using the procedure shown in the video. These types of questions mainly assess whether the student was paying attention to the video and knows how to apply the procedure. Such questions do not intellectually engage students to think deeply about what they are watching. This article introduces different types of embedded questions that can enhance students’ learning as they watch videos. An awareness of various pedagogical reasons for embedding a question can expand teachers’ repertoire of the kinds of questions they can consider embedding should they wish to assign math videos for their students to watch, especially in a flipped learning model.",58,Flipped Learning: Embedding Questions in Videos
