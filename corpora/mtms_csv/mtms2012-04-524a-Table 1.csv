"CHALLENGE 6. how many people could attend a picnic in which each person gets 2 hot dogs and 2 cookies if hot dogs come in packs of 10, buns in packs of 8, and cookies in packs of 12, and the number of hot dogs, buns, and cookies come  out even? how many packs of  hot dogs, buns, and cookies  would be needed?

"FIRE UP THE GRILL 1. If Brutus and Gladys expect their  guests to each eat 2 hot dogs, how many people in all will be at their barbeque? 4. What is the smallest combination of 10-pack hot dogs, 6-pack buns, and 12-pack cookies that Brutus could buy and have the same  number of hot dogs, buns, and cookies? 2. Cookies are sold in boxes of 12. If they also want each person at the barbeque to get 2 cookies, how many boxes of cookies should Brutus buy? Will there be cookies leftover? 3.  When Brutus went to the store, he  discovered that some buns were available in packages of 6. What  is the smallest combination of  10-pack hot dogs and 6-pack buns that he could buy and have the same number of hot dogs and buns? 5. suppose that your class is having a picnic, and you are in charge of food planning. The store sells hot dogs in packs of 10, buns in packs of 8, and cookies in boxes of 12. how many packages of each will you need if all students and your teacher will be at the picnic and each person eats 2 hot dogs and  2 cookies? What are the best combinations of the three items that you should buy? What, if anything, will be leftover in each situation? from the May 2012 issue of edited by stephen P. smith, northern michigan University, marquette, and Peggy House, northern michigan University, marquette.

"soLUTIoNs 1.  Four packs of hot dogs and 5 packs  of buns result in 4 × 10 = 5 × 8 =  40 hot dogs. If each person eats 2 hot dogs, 20 people will be attending.  3.  We are looking for the least common multiple, or LCM, of 10 and 6, which is 30. Brutus could buy  3 packages of hot dogs (3 × 10) and 5 packages of buns (5 × 6).",4,mtms2012-04-524a,,
"2.  If 20 people get 2 cookies each,   40 cookies will be needed. Brutus will have to buy 4 boxes of 12 cookies each, or 4 × 12 = 48 cookies. Eight cookies will be leftover.  4.  Now we are looking for the LCM of 10, 6, and 12, which is 60, so Brutus should buy 6 packs of hot dogs  (6 × 10), 10 packs of buns (10 × 6), and 5 boxes of cookies (5 × 12).",5,mtms2012-04-524a,,

"6.  The LCM of 10 (hot dogs),   8 (buns), and 12 (cookies) is 120, so to come out even we will need 12 packs of hot dogs (10 × 12),  15 packs of buns (8 × 15), and  10 boxes of cookies (12 × 10). With 120 hot dogs and 120 cookies, 60 people could each eat  2 hot dogs and 2 cookies.",7,mtms2012-04-524a,,

"I used the activity with seventhgrade students in a lower-level class as motivation for a lesson on greatest common factor and least common multiple. We read the cartoon as a class, and I revealed one question at a time on the board. Students worked in small groups to answer each question and shared their results, question by question, with the class. ",9,mtms2012-04-524a,,
"Splitting up the questions helped  my struggling students stay motivated. They were not intimidated by facing all the questions at once. Guiding them through the questions helped keep everyone focused and ensured that I caught misconceptions before  students moved on to the next item. This is a good activity to complete using manipulatives. Different shapes, which can represent packages of hot dogs, buns, or cookies, may help students visualize the situation.

"All six of my seventh-grade and eighth-grade algebra classes completed this activity. All had previously worked with finding the least common multiple (LCM). Many could identify with the situation after we discussed the humor in the comic. What to do with the leftover buns ranged from “feeding the ducks” to “throwing out ancient packages found in the back of the freezer.” Although one student immediately recognized that the solution involved finding the LCM, most did not.",20,mtms2012-04-524a,,
"Following a few attempts at guess  and check, the students organized their information in a three-column data table containing headings for “number of packages,” “number of hot dogs,” and “number of buns.” If necessary, we could easily add a column to this table for “number of cookies.” After realizing that they were looking for a number that was common, students figured out that the situation called  for finding the LCM. From there, they were able to complete the activity independently or while working with a partner. They then shared the results.",21,mtms2012-04-524a,,
"Some of the classes extended the  lesson by applying the situation to other scenarios, such as music. A jig is in 3/4 time and a reel is in 4/4, or common, time. Student volunteers “conducted” the class to discover a pattern for sharing a downbeat. They quickly found that four measures of a jig and three measures of a reel would produce the common downbeats. This lesson provided an opportunity to learn to recognize situations in which the GCF and the LCM are useful.",22,mtms2012-04-524a,,

"My Math 8 students, who are representative of students with many strengths and interests, fully invested  themselves in working on solving these problems. (Perhaps the mountains of snow outside our classroom during the field test contributed to enthusiasm for summer thoughts.) I furnished students with a document before they began solving the problems with partners. The document allowed them space to write their answers beneath the questions themselves and encouraged students to use the strategies they know about “talking to the text,” highlighting key terms, and writing a twenty-five word summary of the problem context (the first item on my student response sheet). (Techniques referenced are from the Reading Apprenticeship program implemented in Livingston and Washtenaw, Michigan, counties over the past few years.)",26,mtms2012-04-524a,,
