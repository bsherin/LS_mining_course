8,Assembling the Puzzle of Mathematical Strengths,"Teaching is a complex endeavor that requires teachers to tackle many  problems of practice. In Principles  to Actions: Ensuring Mathematical Success for All (2014), NCTM argued  that creating effective classrooms and learning environments for all students in every school will take teachers who “work collaboratively with colleagues to plan instruction, solve common challenges, and provide mutual support as they take collective responsibility for student learning” (p. 114). As five middle school mathematics teachers from the same district and two mathematics teacher educators, we formed a professional learning community (PLC) to support our students’ learning by examining and building on their mathematical strengths. By recognizing and valuing the strengths and contributions of every student, we empower them mathematically in the classroom (Cohen and Lotan 2014; Featherstone et al. 2011). As a PLC, we see these strengths as pieces of a puzzle for us to assemble and use as we plan lessons, design group-worthy tasks, and implement interventions to meet the needs of our students. We have worked together to answer the questions presented at the beginning of this article. These questions prompted us to pause and reflect on our students and our beliefs about mathematical strengths. As you can imagine, this is not an easy task; however, by working collaboratively, we are constantly learning and growing in our understanding of our students.

Our guiding principle has been based on Little and Horn’s (2007) suggestion that “talk within teacher communities is likely to be generative of professional learning and instructional improvement to the extent that it invites disclosure of and reflection on problems of practice” (p. 91). In our PLC, we learn from each other by sharing, listening, and reflecting on our pedagogical problems of practice. We named ourselves the Mathematics Pedagogical Problem Solvers (MPPS) because problems of practice are more likely to be resolved when teachers collaborate with colleagues in a professional learning community.",13,Assembling the Puzzle of Mathematical Strengths
14,Assembling the Puzzle of Mathematical Strengths,"In our first year, we focused on the myriad problems that arose in our teaching, including motivating students, differentiating instruction for diverse learners, and navigating  new curricular resources and district mandates. Unfortunately, we found ourselves spending much of our meetings discussing our students’ weaknesses and unproductive behaviors instead of focusing on solutions to our pedagogical problems. This process of sharing frustrations helped each of us normalize these problems of practice, but it led to little or no constructive change in our classrooms. By the end of the year, we had begun to shift our perspectives away from what our students could not do and understand and toward what they could do and understand, which we refer to as their strengths. This shift of perspective was empowering and challenging at the same time, requiring us to broaden our definition of a mathematical strength. Our PLC’s second guiding principle became the belief that every student brings strengths into the classroom, and it is up to us, as teachers, to identify and capitalize on those strengths for everyone’s benefit. From that point onward, our discussions of classroom experiences focused generally on sharing and synthesizing advice on how to best use students’ strengths.",14,Assembling the Puzzle of Mathematical Strengths

18,Assembling the Puzzle of Mathematical Strengths,"Students can display mathematical  strengths beyond rapid computation and other attributes that are traditionally seen as displays of intelligence and understanding (see Featherstone et al. 2011). For example, some students may think deeply about the context of a mathematical problem but are unable to recall basic facts. As a PLC, we decided our first goal was to define what we meant by mathematical strengths. We considered the Common Core’s Standards for Mathematical Practice (SMP) (CCSSI 2010) as we did this, but we wanted to define explicitly the strengths we saw students demonstrate in our classrooms. We see our students’ strengths as building blocks for us to use as we help them achieve the SMPs. We began by individually reflecting  on the students in our classrooms as mathematical thinkers and doers, with each of us constructing a list of what we perceived to be their strengths. Next, we shared and combined our lists to create a group list of student strengths. Our group list included approximately 30 strengths, with many of the items needing further refining and organizing. We also realized that we had different interpretations for a given strength and that it can be displayed in different ways. For example, two different interpretations of “perseverance” arose: (a) student does not give up when he or she “gets a wrong solution”; and (b) student does not give up on a problem when he or she “cannot find a solution” to a problem. We found both of these considerations of perseverance to be important but decided to collapse these distinctions into one strength. To resolve these discrepancies, we met and discussed our different interpretations of students’ strengths until we reached consensus.

As we discussed our findings, we found that some strengths, such as “knows basic facts,” were easier to identify in our students than others. For example, “takes risks—willing to contribute even if he or she does not know the answer” was difficult to identify because this strength varies depending on the student, and it requires us to know whether the student knows the answer before sharing it with the class. As we talked about this strength, we reflected on what a student actually risks when he or she contributes to a class discussion. We agreed that students who contribute  to the class discussion, especially middle school students, are risking academic or social standing in the class. That is, they are risking giving a wrong answer (academic standing) and that other students will comment on their answer in ways that make them feel uncomfortable (social standing). We decided to revise the strength to “takes risks—willing to contribute” because we want to acknowledge that any student who publicly shares his or her ideas has that mathematical strength. We engaged in similar discussions about the other strengths that required us to know the student on an individual basis. ",21,Assembling the Puzzle of Mathematical Strengths

25,Assembling the Puzzle of Mathematical Strengths,"mathematical strength for most of our students was straightforward. Many students displayed multiple strengths, but we had difficulty identifying evidence of any strengths for a few of our students. These few students often had behavior problems that made it hard to see their strengths while we were teaching. Therefore, we enlisted the help of our PLC’s members and decided to observe each other’s classrooms. We observed classes in pairs and asked the observers to look for strengths in specific students. We purposefully listened to what students said and did as they worked in groups and what they said when they shared their solutions with the class. As students worked in groups, we noted how the group worked together and whether the targeted student “pays attention to details,” “generates examples and counterexamples,” or “thinks of a simpler problem.” We also reviewed students’ written work for evidence of any  alternative methods or diagrams they used to solve the task. Observing a particular group of students allowed us to ask the group questions and to note their responses as the observed teacher circulated through the class. During class discussions, as in our own class observations, we decided that students who justify how or why they solved a problem are “taking risks” and might also be demonstrating the strengths “explains ideas to other students,” “has reasoning skills,” and is “confident in what he or she knows.” Having an outside perspective revealed strengths we had not seen, thus broadening our understanding of our own students’ mathematical strengths. ",25,Assembling the Puzzle of Mathematical Strengths
26,Assembling the Puzzle of Mathematical Strengths,"After multiple peer observations  and assessments of our own students, we refined our list of strengths. Through this iterative process, a taxonomy was formed. We represent the Taxonomy of Students’ Mathematical Strengths (White et al. 2017) as puzzle  pieces because we believe that each category is a part of being a well-rounded mathematical thinker (see fig. 2). The puzzle is intentionally incomplete because we know that these strengths are not the only factors that contribute to a student’s mathematical identity. The 17 strengths were categorized into five broad categories of mathematical thinking: mathematical knowledge, motivation, identity as a doer of mathematics, communication, and problem solving. These categories helped us see how the strengths were tied together. ",26,Assembling the Puzzle of Mathematical Strengths
27,Assembling the Puzzle of Mathematical Strengths,USING STUDENT STRENGTHS IN MATH CLASS,27,Assembling the Puzzle of Mathematical Strengths
28,Assembling the Puzzle of Mathematical Strengths,"The taxonomy was originally used to reflect on our students’ strengths after lessons and to share our learning during the MPPS meetings. After becoming comfortable with the taxonomy, we became better at identifying student strengths and highlighting them during classroom interactions with students. This has been beneficial for us as we find that every student is capable of participating in the mathematics in some form or manner. We have also encouraged students to use their mathematical strengths as they engage in tasks and lessons. “Opening up more ways to do math creates more opportunities for more children to see themselves, and for others to see them, as smart in math” (Featherstone et al. 2011, p. 16). For example, when a student attempts to communicate an alternative way of solving a problem, we publicly acknowledge the student’s idea or invite other students to comment on the method. Taking into consideration students’ strengths, we are better able to leverage their capabilities and create specific scenarios where those strengths will be needed. This in turn can help students accept mathematics not only as computation but also as a process of problem solving. ",28,Assembling the Puzzle of Mathematical Strengths
29,Assembling the Puzzle of Mathematical Strengths,"Our use of students’ strengths fit  into three categories: (a) acknowledging  students’ strengths to support mathematical thinkers and doers, (b) recognizing students’ strengths to encourage participation, and (c) considering students’ strengths to plan lessons.

31,Assembling the Puzzle of Mathematical Strengths,"As a member of the PLC, I became a much better facilitator of learning when I allowed the students in my classroom to use what they already knew to think and demonstrate how they would solve problems. Before joining the PLC, I did not think students had mathematical strengths beyond basic computations, and I taught mathematics by guiding students through the methods described in the textbook. I did not give students the opportunity to explore the mathematics in the problems and to come up with their own methods for solving them. After we developed the taxonomy, I learned to look for student strengths and acknowledge them to emphasize to my students that they are mathematical thinkers and doers.

After students worked through the problem, I asked them to show their solution strategies. Some students used a double number line whereas others compared the different concentrations using fractions and decimals. To my surprise, no one used the method I suggested.

37,Assembling the Puzzle of Mathematical Strengths,"Before joining the PLC, at this  point, like many teachers, I might have shown my ratio table and forced the discussion back to that method at the expense of the opportunity for students to make deeper mathematical connections based on the variety of student thinking. Instead of focusing on their incorrect solutions, I noted the mathematical sense that students were making of the situation. By acknowledging the student’s strength, I was providing positive feedback to the student and allowing the student to feel comfortable with exploring problems. Overall, I changed my perspective on what students can do in mathematics.",37,Assembling the Puzzle of Mathematical Strengths

39,Assembling the Puzzle of Mathematical Strengths,"In my experience, once a teacher recognizes and uses a student’s mathematical strength, that student is more likely to be engaged in the classroom. My work with the PLC helped me  realize that once I recognize and value students’ strengths in class, they are more likely to continue using them. The taxonomy also gave me a framework and a way to talk with my students about their abilities. ",39,Assembling the Puzzle of Mathematical Strengths
40,Assembling the Puzzle of Mathematical Strengths,"For example, in one of my seventhgrade mathematics classes, there was a student who usually had a difficult time focusing during lessons. It was challenging to identify his mathematical strengths because he completed very little work and rarely participated in class. During one class period, the first mathematics problem involved combining four numbers in any order with any operations to equal 24 (see  fig. 3). I used this type of problem for my students to practice their problemsolving skills and fact fluency. When this student heard the challenge, he focused on the problem in a way that I had not seen before in class. He was fluent with math facts, and the puzzlelike nature of the problem drew him in. He solved the problem by mentally working through various expressions. Before my work with the PLC, I would have told the student, “You worked hard on that problem,” and then hoped it happened again. The taxonomy helped me recognize that he demonstrated the strengths “has reasoning skills” and “perseverance.” After that  them as mathematical thinkers and doers. Through intentional identification and planning, we as teachers can discover students’ strengths and organize learning experiences that engage all students. As we reflect on our experiences in the MPPS, we have learned some lessons: •   Some mathematical tasks are more  likely to reveal certain mathematical strengths. We learned that we have to be aware of which strengths are likely to be seen and not seen in a task. High-cognitive demanding tasks promote more discussion of the mathematics and thereby provide more opportunities for students to display their strengths. We thought about our tasks on the basis of the work of Smith and Stein (1998); Phillips and Zawojewski (2011); and  Lappan, Smith, and Jones (2011). •   Student strengths can be used to address mathematical misconceptions. Previously, when a student misconception arose in the classroom, we focused our energy on correcting it. Now we focus on ways that students can help each other address the misconception. For example, knowing that a student understands the concept and has the strength “explains ideas to other students well” allows us to call on that student to provide an alternative way to think about the misconception. We learned that by acknowledging students’ strengths as we engage in class discussions, students can help one another learn mathematics.  •   Staying positive with a focus on  students’ strengths requires supportive colleagues. We learned that it is easy for us to look at our taxonomy and focus on the strengths that students lack instead of the ones they possess, and our colleagues were essential in helping us stay positive.  I class period, I began each day with a similar four-number challenge, which helped me engage this student. He was often the first one in class and often the first student to find the solution. I leveraged his excitement for the first problem to encourage him to produce more work during the remainder of the lessons.",40,Assembling the Puzzle of Mathematical Strengths
41,Assembling the Puzzle of Mathematical Strengths,"Story 3: Considering Students’ Strengths to Plan Lessons When I was learning to plan lessons, student strengths were not a major emphasis of my planning; I focused on the task instead of the students. Joining the PLC during my first year of teaching created a foundation for me to focus on student strengths while planning mathematics lessons and reflecting on my students’ progress. Intentionally incorporating strengths in lesson planning allows me to make sure that opportunities exist for a variety of strengths to shine. For example, as students transition from solving equations with positive integers to solving equations with negative integers, I want them to “pay attention to the details” of the equation so they can eventually generalize about equation types and, in turn, decide what strategies might be appropriate to use. Knowing which students are good at paying attention to details lets me create opportunities for them  to show that strength. Therefore, I plan to pose such questions as “How is this equation different from the equations we solved last week?” or “Compare and contrast these equations” to prompt particular students to demonstrate their strengths. ",41,Assembling the Puzzle of Mathematical Strengths
42,Assembling the Puzzle of Mathematical Strengths,"When planning a lesson centered on applying the Pythagorean theorem to real-world applications, I recognized a common student error of forgetting to find the square root of the missing side (e.g., answering the problem with the solution being the value of b2 instead of b). Knowing that some of my students have the strength of “remembers the context of a problem” allowed me to plan to ask specific students the question, “Does our solution make sense?” Calling on specific students allowed them to assert their competence and mathematical authority in bringing the error to the class to be addressed without my identifying the error.

We know the Taxonomy of Students’ Mathematical Strengths can be improved by including the perspectives of our students. During the 2015–2016 school year, we designed activities to solicit our students’ ideas about mathematical strengths (White et al. 2017). From this work, we learned that students could “identify academic and mathematical strengths in general or in their peers, even though they often struggled to see their own mathematical strengths” (p. 45).
