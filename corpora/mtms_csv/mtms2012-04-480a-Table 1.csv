"Samuel Obara sSpatial abilities help students identify features of various shapes and the relationship that exists among these features. Being able to mentally manipulate images and tell what those images represent are important spatial skills. Research has highlighted the relationship between mathematics performance and spatial abilities (Burnett, Lane, and Dratt 1979; Geary et al. 2000; and Robinson et al. 1996). According to Casey and colleagues (2008), “Spatial skills involve the ability to think and reason through the comparison, manipulation, and transformation of mental pictures” (p. 270). NCTM also describes the importance of teaching spatial reasoning to young students as they are introduced to mathematics (NCTM 1989, 2000).",2,mtms2012-04-480a,,
"This article’s activity, given to prospective middle school teachers, challenges their spatial reasoning skills. The goal is to identify two congruent fi gures embedded inside a fi gure (see fi g. 1). As illustrated with polygon 1, the dotted lines cut the polygon into two congruent halves. This activity helps students become aware that two fi gures are congruent if they have the same shape and the same size.",3,mtms2012-04-480a,,
"Readers are encouraged to fi nd the congruent shapes in all 10 polygons in fi gure 1. Which polygon do you fi nd  the most challenging? Why? How would you divide the 10 polygons into groups, from the least challenging to the most challenging? Comparisons among the 10 polygons are presented in p. 483’s sidebar, “5 Categories of the 10 Shapes.”  halves?",4,mtms2012-04-480a,,
"While working on this activity, some students did not know what constituted congruency. Some had a misconception that for polygons to be congruent, they must have the same orientation (Sorby 1999). This activity allowed students to cut a two-dimensional fi gure into two parts and test whether the two parts were congruent by moving one part to match the other.  hoW stUdents engaged With the actiVitY",5,mtms2012-04-480a,,
"Of all the polygons given in this activity, three in particular were challenging but provided students with insight as they visualized ways to split the polygon into two congruent halves. Students indicated that spotting congruent lengths and angles and seeing the type of transformation (rotation, refl ection, or translation) were critical in fi nding the solution. It should again be noted that the knowledge of what makes polygons congruent was critical, since some students were unsure. Using polygon 1 in fi gure 1 as an example helped students understand the expectation for the activity. Polygons 10, 5, and 6 are presented in turn. ",6,mtms2012-04-480a,,

"In polygon 10, nothing was immediately obvious except the long length of BD, which I knew must be cut because there is not another possible edge of the polygon that long. The point C is the only point on BD that lies on a grid point, and it is halfway between BD, making it the only point to cut BD. I tried directly connecting point C and other vertices in the polygon.

"In trying to make this work, I noticed that I needed a small acute angle at G to match the angle EDC. Finally, I tried connecting CG . This created the angle that I needed, and I realized that it also created the parallelogram CGFE matching CBAH. The fi nal solution seemed so obvious when I fi nished, especially because if I had tried more than just CA  and CF  earlier, I would have reached the solution much sooner. This solution involves adding just one edge connecting at one of the vertices. This was easier than the solution for polygon 5. That solution involves two new edges, which do not have any endpoints on the vertices. ",16,mtms2012-04-480a,,

"Some students may look at the polygons and recognize their congruency, but some may not because the two have a different orientation. Asking students to cut out the original polygon and then cut it into its two congruent parts was helpful for those with visualization diffi culties. Students then overlapped the polygons to see if the shapes fi t each other perfectly. Students need to develop this skill so that they can mentally manipulate images to fi t a required task.

"Polygon 5 was the last solution that I found. One thing that was immediately obvious is that it contained two congruent trapezoids covering most of  the area of the polygon, IJKP ≅ KLMO [see fi g. 3a]. This left only two unit squares that I had to cut in half, with one attached to each trapezoid. There are limited polygon ways to cut those two squares in half, and unlike with polygon 10, I exhausted all of my possibilities. None of those attempts gave me two congruent halves. I started looking at the general shape. I noticed that the only edges of the polygon LM, not on grid lines were  JK which both have the same slope. Realizing that the trapezoids would not work for a solution, I looked at just the triangles SJK and RLM [see fi g. 3b], which are congruent. Then I tried to recreate that slope of the line in the remaining area.  and",22,mtms2012-04-480a,,
The student tried to fi nd ways that would create another sloped edge to the halves of the polygon while maintaining the triangles as congruent areas in the two halves. She had a diffi cult time seeing the polygon  5 categories of the 10 shapes,23,mtms2012-04-480a,,
"The 10 shapes can be grouped into 5 classifi cations on the basis of the type of spatial reasoning that each develops.  •  Group 1 polygons (polygon 2) require one horizontal cut (the line of symmetry) to create two congruent shapes. Polygon 2 can be tested by simply reﬂ ecting along the line of symmetry.  •  Group 2 polygons (1 and 3),  whose vertices are all right angles, require one horizontal cut and one vertical cut to create congruent parts. Whereas polygon 1 requires a translation, polygon 3 requires one rotation to test congruency.",24,mtms2012-04-480a,,
"•  Group 3 polygons (4, 8, and 9) require only one cut to create congruent parts. Whereas polygon 4 requires a horizontal line, polygons 8 and 9 require a diagonal line. For all three polygons, only one rotation is needed to test congruency.",25,mtms2012-04-480a,,
"•  Group 4 polygons (7 and 10)  require one diagonal cut to create congruent parts, but that cut passes through the midpoint of the longest side of the polygon. As with group 3 polygons, only one rotation is needed to test congruency. •  Group 5 polygons (5 and 6)  require one horizontal cut and one diagonal cut to create congruent parts. To determine the cuts, students need to analyze the features in the polygon to identify congruent angles, congruent sides, and congruent parts. To test congruency, only one rotation is needed.",26,mtms2012-04-480a,,

"J, and M (see fig. 4a), which obviously demonstrated that the two areas were not the same and hence did not yield congruent halves. The students also tried to connect points D, J, and M (see fig. 4b). However, that line was not the correct dot-to-dot line needed to create congruent polygons. This group of students moved on to another option of connecting points L, J, and E (see fig. 4c). The students disagreed that this was the correct strategy. However, after debate among themselves, they decided to cut out the polygons and move them around to see if they match or overlap when placed correctly with the same orienta- tion. Many students were unconvinced until the shapes were physically cut out and manipulated to test the overlap. The orientation of the polygons made it difficult for some students to see why points L, J, and E comprised the dot-to-dot line that was needed to create the two equivalent polygons.",30,mtms2012-04-480a,,

"Spatial reasoning is an important skill that students need to understand mathematics. Exposing students to similar activities as these can enhance students’ spatial skills or uncover areas that need to be developed. Such an activity combines individual and group work with good strategies that can be employed in the classroom. Letting students struggle and giving them opportunities to learn are important. Teachers should provide needed resources in case students make mistakes. For example, a pair of scissors is necessary so that students can cut polygons and rotate them to test their congruency.

Fig. 4 Creating congruent parts for polygon 6 involved a lot of trial and error by students. The solution required two segments that shared an endpoint at the only gridded point inside the initial figure.,34,mtms2012-04-480a,,
"in any other way. It seemed to her that there was too much similarity between the areas for them not to be congruent. A challenge kept occurring because K and P are so close; they almost divide the polygon into two parts, with one part being smaller than the other.

"The change in perspective occurred  when she realized the challenge and then tried to work within the rectangle whose diagonal is PQ. Once again, she tried recreating the slope of the line. When she tried PQ and looked closely at it, she realized that by connecting Q to R she had found the solution (see fig. 3c). The triangles (JKS and LMR) that she thought had to be congruent parts of the halves were not. She had to create one triangle with new edges, and the other trapezoid QMNP was created and congruent to the trapezoid KPIJ. This solution was the most difficult to find because it was the only one that required two edges, and none of the endpoints were on vertices of the polygon. ",36,mtms2012-04-480a,,

"Polygon 6 intrigued students simply because of its shape. It had only one point inside the boundaries (identified as J in fig. 4).

The focus was then turned to point J, inside the polygon, and its  potential dot-to-dot line, as one student pointed out,",38,mtms2012-04-480a,,
"The dot-to-dot line must go through point J. Otherwise, since it is the only one inside the polygon, it will be the only one inside one of the two polygons when the dot-to-dot line is created and, therefore, make the two polygons not congruent.",39,mtms2012-04-480a,,

"This activity can also be used to  help students understand the connection between congruent figures and shape-and-size-preserving transformations such as rotation, translation, and reflection. For example, students can be asked to discuss whether the act of rotating, reflecting, and translating would change the size or the shape of the part that is being moved. If appropriate, rotation, reflection, and translation of a figure can be introduced as transformations that preserve the shape and the size of an object.",41,mtms2012-04-480a,,
