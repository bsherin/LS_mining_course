Middle-Grades  Mathematics Standards:  Issues and Implications,2,mtms2008-12-275a,,
"NCTM’s vision for school mathematics includes a call for curriculum that is “coherent, focused on important mathematics, and well articulated across the grades” (NCTM 2000, p. 14). In an effort to improve student learning of mathematics, a major focus over the past two decades has been on the dual goals of identifying curriculum standards and aligning curriculum materials and assessments with the standards. This strategy was further promoted by the No Child Left Behind legislative mandate for states to adopt “challenging academic content standards” in mathematics, reading and language arts, and science that (a) specify what children are expected to know and be able to do; (b) contain coherent and rigorous content; and (c) encourage the teaching of advanced skills in these areas.

"This department provides a forum to stimulate discussion on contemporary curricular issues across a K–12 audience. NCTM plans to publish sets of three articles, focused on a single curriculum issue. Each article will address the issue from the perspective of the audience of the journal in which it appears. Collectively, the articles are intended to increase communication and dialogue on issues of common interest related to curriculum. Manuscripts on any contemporary curriculum issues are welcome. Submissions can be for one article for one particular journal, or they can be for a series of three articles, one for each journal. Submit manuscripts at the appropriate Web site: tcm.msubmit.net, mtms.msubmit.net, or mt.msubmit.net, or contact editors Barbara Reys (reysb@missouri.edu) for TCM, Glenda Lappan (glappan@math.msu.edu) for MTMS, or Chris Hirsch (christian .hirsch@wmich.edu) for MT.

"Left Behind (NCLB) Act in 2001, new versions of state standards connected to annual assessments have become a reality for all involved with education. Teachers, in particular, have been greatly impacted by this development. Teachers and other school district personnel have been charged with interpreting the expectations of NCLB and incorporating them into classroom practice. For many, state standards or grade level expectations (GLEs) now compete with the adopted text for classroom time and attention (Reys, Dingman, Sutter, and Teuscher 2005).",8,mtms2008-12-275a,,
"In response to this shift, the ",9,mtms2008-12-275a,,
"Center for the Study of Mathematics Curriculum (CSMC) analyzed standards for more than forty states in the topics of number and operations (including uses of technology), algebra, mathematical reasoning, geometry and measurement, and probability and statistics. (See Reys 2006 for published analyses of number and operations, algebra, and mathematical reasoning in the state standards.) The primary question asked by the CSMC was this: In grades K−8, what do states expect students to know and be able to do and at what grade level? In this article, we highlight some issues related to the content of standards in the middle grades (5−8) that emerged from the CSMC’s analysis. First, the grade level where specific topics are introduced varies among states, and grade-level gaps as well as content gaps exist for many topics. Second, many of the grade level expectations state that students should be able to perform procedures, whereas other GLEs state that students need to develop deeper understanding. Third, the clarity of a GLE is affected by its structure and content. To illustrate these points, we use examples from current state standards documents. (Although states continue to revise these  fig. 1 Distribution of grade level expectations on the topic of similarity by state and grade level documents, all examples here come from current standards documents as of March 2008. See the CSMC Web site at www.mathcurriculumcenter .org/states.php for a complete listing of current standards documents for all states.)  develoPMent of content",10,mtms2008-12-275a,,
"When making content decisions, many teachers rely on their state’s GLEs for the specific grade level that they teach. Careful study of the mathematics standards for the grades immediately preceding and following the grade currently being taught is necessary to ensure a coherent curriculum for progressing students. Just as a Shakespearean play is not revealed by reading a single act (or reading only the lines of a single character), the mathematical learning trajectory of kindergarten through grade 8 only emerges when a broader range of GLEs are taken together. Topics in state GLEs vary. The  grade in which a particular topic is first introduced differs. Also, in some states, a topic appears continuously in every grade following its initial appearance;  in other states, one or more grades are skipped before the topic reappears. To illustrate these variations, figure 1 shows, by state, the grade levels that contain GLEs on the topic of similarity.",11,mtms2008-12-275a,,
"When teachers make decisions  based solely on standards for a single grade level and do not carefully examine standards for earlier grades, they may be unaware of students’ prior experiences and knowledge. For example, the following expectations are from grade 6.  •  Example A: Describe relationships between the corresponding angles and the length of corresponding sides of similar triangles (whole number scale factors). (Missouri, grade 6) •	 Example B: Demonstrates conceptual understanding of similarity by describing the proportional effect on the linear dimensions of polygons or circles when scaling up or down while preserving the angles of polygons, or by solving related problems (including applying scales on maps). Describes effects using models or explanations. (Rhode Island, grade 6)",12,mtms2008-12-275a,,
"Although lessons that incorporate each of these expectations may be comparable when considering only these statements, vast differences emerge when considering GLEs on the topic of similarity in grades before grade 6. In Missouri (example A), this is the first time that the topic of similarity appears. However, Rhode Island (example B) includes similarity GLEs in previous grades. In Rhode Island, students have already been expected to “identify similar shapes” (grade 3), “apply characteristics of similar figures (same shape but not necessarily the same size) to identify similar figures” (grade 4), and “describe proportional effect on the linear dimensions of triangles and rectangles when scaling up or down while preserving angle measures” (grade 5). Knowing the prior experiences allows decisions to be tailored to the needs of the students and, in this case, may necessitate a sixth-grade lesson in Missouri to be different from a sixth-grade lesson in Rhode Island. ",13,mtms2008-12-275a,,
"Figure 1 also shows that in  some states the topic of similarity is dropped for two or more grades before it reappears in an expectation. This happens frequently. To minimize the problematic effects of these discontinuities, teachers need to look for and understand the development of the content in grades before and after the grade they currently teach. Figure 1 shows that New York first introduces similarity at grade 3. It continues in grade 4 but does not reappear until grade 8. If fifth-, sixth-, and seventh-grade teachers base curricular decisions on expectations only in their grade level, the gains made by students in these earlier grades would be lost and result in extra time needed in eighth grade to reintroduce the topic. By looking at GLEs of the previous and following grades, a teacher can identify the topics that are not continuous through the grade levels  and plan lessons accordingly. Where grade-level gaps occur, teachers might look for ways to revisit these topics in the context of other topics. ",14,mtms2008-12-275a,,
"In addition to grade-level gaps,  developmental gaps exist in the mathematical content in GLEs. To recognize and deal with developmental gaps, one can study the learning trajectory formed by the GLEs across multiple grade levels. For example, a standards analysis identified that developmental gaps exist in the learning trajectory of geometry expectations in many states. This analysis of geometry GLEs used the five levels developed by van Hiele from studying students’ development of geometric reasoning. At level 1, a figure is recognizable by its visible form, not by its properties; at level 2, properties are perceived but are isolated and unrelated; at level 3, relationships between properties are perceived; at level 4, students can construct and supply reasons for steps in a proof; and at level 5, students understand the formal aspects of deduction (Mayberry 1983). Van Hiele indicated that each level is qualitatively different from the others and emphasized that it is not possible to skip levels, even  though students pass through them at varying rates. ",15,mtms2008-12-275a,,
"Table 1 applies the van Hiele  levels to a single state’s descriptive geometry GLEs. Kindergarten and grade 1 GLEs are at level 1 where students are expected to recognize figures and sort them based on their overall appearance. Level 2 emerges in the expectations for grades 3 and 4, which articulate identifying and describing the properties of figures. Finally, level 3 appears in grades 6 and 7 where definitions and the class structure of quadrilaterals are introduced. ",16,mtms2008-12-275a,,
"Although the state in this example  has levels 1, 2, and 3, not all states were found to contain these three levels in their standards documents. Of all the descriptive geometry GLEs included in the analysis, only 4 percent represented level 3 expectations. Some states included no level 3 expectations. An analysis of the standards for high school geometry courses revealed that the majority of states included standards at level 4 (i.e., proof writing). (At the time of this analysis, eighteen states had published standards for a high school geometry  table 1 A selection of plane geometry grade level expectations in Virginia grade grade level expectations (gle) level",17,mtms2008-12-275a,,

"course.) Since, according to van Hiele, it is not possible to skip levels, there are developmental gaps in content between K−8 expectations and high school expectations. ",23,mtms2008-12-275a,,
"This is only one example; there are probably gaps in other topics as well. Studying learning trajectories across grades may be especially useful when year after year students struggle with the same content. By looking at GLEs across grades, teachers can determine if and where a gap exists in the expectations and then make informed classroom decisions.  doing versus evaluating",24,mtms2008-12-275a,,
"Asking students to perform a mathematical operation or process (e.g., multiply and divide fractions) is an entirely different task from asking them to explain or justify a strategy, algorithm, or process or interpret a numerical result in a contextual problem setting. Although many GLEs expect students to do something, others expect students to evaluate these processes. We call these two types of expectations Type I and Type II, respectively.  •  Example C: Collect, organize, ana- lyze, and display data (including box plots and histograms) to solve problems. (North Carolina, grade 7) •  Example D: Determine the appropriate type of graph to effectively display data. (Maryland, grade 5) ",25,mtms2008-12-275a,,
Example C is a Type I GLE. ,26,mtms2008-12-275a,,
"This expectation focuses on doing something, such as collecting data or making a variety of visual displays. In contrast, example D, a Type 2 GLE, emphasizes judging the appropriateness of a visual display, not just its creation. Being able to determine an appropriate display but not being able to construct one, or being able to construct a variety of displays but not knowing which is appropriate, are both incomplete forms of understand- ing. Thus, both Type 1 and Type 2 expectations are needed.",27,mtms2008-12-275a,,
"•  Example E: Generate equivalent forms of rational numbers including whole numbers, fractions, and decimals. (Texas, grade 6)  •  Example F: Explain and use the  relationship among equivalent representations of rational numbers in mathematical and practical situations. (Nevada, grade 8)",28,mtms2008-12-275a,,
"Examples E and F further illustrate differences between Type 1 and Type 2 GLEs. Example E (Type 1) emphasizes the creation of equivalent rational numbers rather than evaluating what makes the two numbers equivalent. In contrast, example F (Type 2) focuses on evaluating why they are equivalent, given that they are equivalent. The state standards analyzed in the statistics strand contained Type 2 GLEs (forty-one states were included in this analysis). The number of Type 2 GLEs increased in the higher grades, and the majority of these were in grades 5−8. By knowing these differences, teachers in these grades can be attentive to the differences between Type 1 and Type 2 GLEs and look for ways to incorporate Type 1 GLEs as Type 2 in the classroom. For example, in a lesson designed to satisfy example E, students may have listed 1/4 and 0.25 as equivalent. In addition to stating that these two are equivalent, discussing how they are equivalent is one way to incorporate evaluation in the GLE.  issues of clarity",29,mtms2008-12-275a,,
"The purpose of content standards is to delineate what students should know and be able to do. Thus, it is essential that standards clearly communicate their curricular expectations to teachers. At times, standards use multiple verbs to express a single expectation, are lengthy, and use ambiguous  language, which can all be confusing. Although some expectations are unclear, recognizing their shortcomings can help teachers better decipher what may be expected.",30,mtms2008-12-275a,,
"•  Example G: Selects, explains the  selection of, and uses measurement tools, units of measure, and level of precision appropriate for a given situation to find accurate rational number representations for length, weight, volume, temperature, time, perimeter, area, and angle measurements. (Kansas, grade 6; emphasis added)",31,mtms2008-12-275a,,
"For example, it is often possible to take one GLE that has two or more verbs and rewrite it to get multiple expectations. In example G, one might conclude that students are expected to— 1.  select measurement tools, 2.  select units of measure, 3.  select an appropriate level of preci- sion,  4.  explain the selection of measurement tools,  5.  explain the selection of units of  measure,  6.  explain the appropriateness of the  level of precision,  7.  use measurement tools, 8.  use units of measure, and 9.  use levels of appropriate precision. ",32,mtms2008-12-275a,,
"Unpacking a GLE in this manner helps to clarify all aspects that a teacher may be expected to help students fulfill.  •  Example H: Demonstrates conceptual understanding of equality by showing equivalence between two expressions (expressions consistent with the parameters on the left- and right-hand sides of the equations being solved at this grade level) using models or different  representations of the expressions, solving formulas for a variable requiring one transformation (e.g., d = rt; d/r = t); by solving multistep linear equations with integer coefficients; by showing that two expressions are not equivalent by applying commutative, associative, or distributive properties, order of operations, or substitution; and by informally solving problems involving systems of equations in a context. (New Hampshire, grade 8) •  Example I: Demonstrate an  understanding of the relationships among tables, equations, verbal expressions, and graphs of linear functions. (Indiana, grade 8) •  Example J: Use variables and appropriate operations to write an expression, a formula, an equation, or an inequality that represents a verbal description. (Indiana, grade 7) •  Example K: Evaluate numerical  expressions and simplify algebraic expressions by applying the correct order of operations and the properties of rational numbers (e.g., identity, inverse, commutative, associative, distributive properties). Justify each step in the process. (Indiana, grade 7)",33,mtms2008-12-275a,,
"Another related issue that affects  teachers’ ability to clearly interpret states’ expectations is the range of specificity and length of the expectations (Newton, Larnell, and Lappan 2006). In some states, teachers must negotiate and balance multiple objectives within a single but “packed” grade level expectation (see example H). In other states, these objectives are parsed into several separate expectations (see examples I, J, K). The method of unpacking and rewriting a single GLE into multiple expectations as described above can also be applied to lengthy and dense GLEs. Again, rewriting helps clarify the content of a GLE.",34,mtms2008-12-275a,,
"•  Example L: Identify, describe, and  label points, lines, rays, line segments, vertices angles, and planes using correct symbolic notation. (Maryland, grade 6; emphasis added)",35,mtms2008-12-275a,,
"Example L illustrates the ambiguity of some GLEs. In L, the task of identifying and labeling objects is clear. How to describe a point or line segment as being different from identifying or labeling it is not as apparent. Some states provide additional supporting documents that help clarify GLEs. Sample assessment items from Maryland indicate that the writers of the standards had diagonals of polygons in mind when they penned “describe line segments”; specifically, whether a line segment is a diagonal of a polygon. Thus, if a state has supporting documents, these documents may help clarify vague expectations as well as indicate mathematical topics that are implied in a GLE.",36,mtms2008-12-275a,,
conclusion,37,mtms2008-12-275a,,
"We have presented some of the findings from our standards analyses that we consider relevant for middlegrades teachers. Even though GLEs typically contain a narrow slice of mathematics, they are part of something larger that only becomes visible when GLEs are collectively examined over several grade levels. Looking at expectations through a series of grades, instead of at one grade level, being attentive to doing (Type 1) and evaluative (Type 2) GLEs, and unpacking and deciphering unclear expectations all take time. Because of the influence of standards over the mathematical and pedagogical decisions of teachers, teachers should be allotted the time needed. ",38,mtms2008-12-275a,,
"For the time being, state standards  and their substantial influence are here to stay. Since they are also continuously reviewed and revised, there  are (and will continue to be) opportunities for teachers, including those at the middle grades, to be engaged and participate in shaping the content of mathematics standards. Teachers’ participation in the evaluation and revision of standards is desirable—for students and teachers. Teachers often have a strong sense of what is possible at each grade level.
