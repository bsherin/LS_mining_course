6,Pythagorean Football Pattern - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I used this Cartoon Corner activity with my eighth-grade prealgebra students who had just finished learning about the Pythagorean theorem. It was a perfect review for them. They didnt know what a vector was, so I explained the concept to them.",,
7,Pythagorean Football Pattern - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"They really liked problem 1. Problem 2 involved simplifying the square root of 200. It was in the comic, so it made sense to ask about it. On an earlier occasion, I had shown my students how to do the computation, but most didnt remember. Some students needed prompts, such as the following: Why didnt Jason say he went the square root of 200 yards? Are they the same? Maybe you can find out if theyre very nearly the same using a calculator. Such prompts would also work if simplifying roots had not yet been taught.",,
8,Pythagorean Football Pattern - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Problems 3 and 4 were fine and kind of easy for my students. We tried problem 5 in class earlier in the week. I helped students a little with that one. Problem 6 was part of a recent assignment, so all students could do it.",,
9,Pythagorean Football Pattern - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"This was one of my favorite Cartoon Corners. My eighth graders worked in pairs and seemed to enjoy it, too.",,

13,Pythagorean Football Pattern - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I tested this activity with my seventh-grade prealgebra class. They were able to draw what was happening in the cartoon and to understand that a triangle was formed without being given the explanation of vectors. The issue of the square root of a number, other than a perfect square, was new to the students, so",,

15,Pythagorean Football Pattern - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"needed some explanation. The students didnt understand the concept of converse, so a brief explanation ensued.",,
16,Pythagorean Football Pattern - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I would use this cartoon when I teach square roots, which is usually at the end of the year in prealgebra. When I teach the Pythagorean theorem, I like to do one of the proofs. I also like to talk about how old the theorem is and tell students that they will encounter more theorems when they get to high school.",,
17,Pythagorean Football Pattern - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I think that given at the right time, this cartoon would be great without any additional instruction. Problem 2 with",,

23,Pythagorean Football Pattern - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"My sixth-grade prealgebra students were introduced to the Pythagorean theorem with this cartoon. We have worked with radicals and formulas, but we have not directly examined  a + b = c. Together we diagrammed Peters football route and noted the right angle that was formed. When we added the route that Jason ran, students recognized the isosceles right triangle, so I introduced the theorem. Simplifying",,

26,Pythagorean Football Pattern - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We also discussed how a 45 degree angle was formed when the hypotenuse was connected to the legs. Some students recognized that the angle was 1/2 of the right angle, whereas others stated that the angles had to be equal because the legs were equal and the sum of the angles of the triangle had to be 180 degrees.",,
27,Pythagorean Football Pattern - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,The remaining problems were an application of a  + b  = c  and provided opportunities to estimate square roots to the tenth and hundredth. The extension problem was excellent for students who were willing to accept a challenge. One student created a square and proved the length of the hypotenuse using the Pythagorean theorem by rearranging pieces of the square!,,
