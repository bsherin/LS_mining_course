Understanding the Value of Pi,2,mtms2010-10-180a,,
"At times, we must ask our students to accept certain content without giving them a full explanation, because understanding the underlying mathematics would require knowledge beyond their current level. One good example of such a concept is the  irrational number pi.   ",3,mtms2010-10-180a,,
"In middle school, students are  taught that pi is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter. They learn to use this number to calculate measurements involving a circle, such as area and circumference. However, it is likely that students do not have a full understanding of pi’s value, because they have not seen how its infinite digits are derived. The problem with demonstrating the derivation of pi is that most methods require an understanding of mathematics that is beyond the middle school level.",4,mtms2010-10-180a,,
"Students are told that pi is approximately equal to 3.14. Since it is irrational, one cannot write the number in its entirety, which is why it is represented with the Greek letter p. A popular poster in many math classrooms shows the first 100 digits of pi. How can we show students at this level where these digits originated? ",5,mtms2010-10-180a,,
A variety of measurement activities lend support to the fact that the ratio of the circumference to the diameter ,6,mtms2010-10-180a,,

However, any measurement itself is an estimate, and the precise and infinite digits that comprise pi cannot be generated by measuring. Although measurement activities may help explain the value that we tell students is equal to pi, these tasks fall dismally short of demonstrating where the precise digits come from.",7,mtms2010-10-180a,,
"Our quest to discover a method for  generating pi that would be understandable to middle school students led us to Archimedes. He was born in 287 BC and studied at the University of Alexandria under the successors of Euclid and perhaps Euclid himself. He took the concept of “equal to” and turned it into the concept of “as closely as desired.” He used this concept to develop a method of calculating pi to any desired degree of accuracy (Beckmann 1971). In other words, before the invention of calculus, Archimedes could calculate pi to as many place values as he wanted. The activity for finding the circumference of a circle described in this article is based on his method.  the Method of archiMedes",8,mtms2010-10-180a,,

"By increasing the number of sides  in the regular polygon, the interval between the two perimeters narrows, and the perimeters approach the circumference of the circle from both sides (see fig. 1). The circumference, or p, can be calculated to any desired place value. After Archimedes laid the groundwork, the number of decimal places to which pi could be calculated was entirely due to computational ability, perseverance, and computer programming (Beckmann 1971).  fig. 1 These shapes illustrate how pi can be measured.",28,mtms2010-10-180a,,

"By generalizing the procedure for finding the perimeter of a polygon with n sides, a program can be written that enables students to determine these perimeters using a graphing calculator. Using a calculator eliminates the drudgery of tedious calculations, perhaps using mathematics that they are not familiar with, and enables  students to focus on the goal of finding increasingly precise values for pi. The program, shown in figure 2, was written for the TI-73 graphing calculator but also works with TI-83 and TI-84 calculators.

"Activity sheet 1, “Finding the Circumference of a Circle,” is a selfguided student investigation that culminates with the formula for the circumference of a circle. To successfully complete this activity on their own, students must have prior knowledge and experience in applying the Pythagorean theorem. We recommend that students work in groups or pairs. Each group of students will need— 1.  activity sheet 1; 2.  a graphing calculator (with the program shown in fig. 2); and 3.  red, blue, and green markers.",37,mtms2010-10-180a,,
"Students trace the circumference  and perimeters of the figure using  specified colors to ensure that they understand the vocabulary introduced in the opening paragraphs. With a quick visual check, the teacher can determine if perimeter, circumference, inscribed, and circumscribed are understood. Students also define a regular polygon. ",38,mtms2010-10-180a,,
"Students then find the perimeters  of the circumscribed and inscribed squares if the diameter of the circle is 1 unit. The circumscribed square is very simple, and students should have no problem determining this perimeter to be 4 units. Finding the perimeter of the inscribed square requires applying the Pythagorean theorem. This perimeter is 2.8 units when rounded to the nearest tenth. Students should conclude that the circle has a circumference between 2.8 units and 4 units.",39,mtms2010-10-180a,,
"Activity sheet 2, “Graphing and Charting a Circle,” introduces students to the calculator program to find perimeters of inscribed and circumscribed polygons. The example of a decagon is shown to illustrate that the interval containing the circumference gets much smaller as the number of sides of the polygon increases. Using a diameter of 1 unit, students determine this interval to be between 3.09017 units and 3.24920 units when rounded to the nearest hundred thousandth. Rounded to the nearest whole number would make the circumference of the circle 3 units. Students use the calculator program to determine the inscribed and circumscribed perimeters of polygons with increasing numbers of sides, always using a diameter of  1 unit. The numbers of sides were carefully chosen to illustrate the value of the circumference with increasing precision. ",40,mtms2010-10-180a,,
"With a decagon, the circumference equals 3 units when rounded to the nearest whole number. With a 25-gon the value of the circumference is precise to the tenths place, with a value of 3.1 units. If we increase the number of sides to 100, the circumference is 3.14 units rounded to the hundredths place. A 200-gon gives a value of 3.141 and a 2500-gon gives a value of 3.14159. ",41,mtms2010-10-180a,,
"This activity concludes by introducing the symbol, p, to represent the value of the circumference of a circle with a diameter of 1 unit. This decimal number will never terminate, and we can get closer and closer to the circle by continuing to increase the number of sides in the polygons. However, the polygon will never actually become a circle.",42,mtms2010-10-180a,,
conclusion,43,mtms2010-10-180a,,
"The Archimedean method can be used to calculate the circumference of a circle to as many place values as desired. However, calculators have a finite number of display positions. This limitation restricts the number of place values that we can determine for pi with this technology. Nevertheless, this activity provides a method of generating the digits of pi that is understandable to students at the middle school level. ",44,mtms2010-10-180a,,
"We have used this activity successfully with preservice elementary teachers. Although they are very familiar with using pi, they are surprised to see the number appear as they find the perimeters of the polygons and come increasingly  closer to the circumference of the circle. Principles and Standards for School Mathematics states that “Learning mathematics with understanding is essential” (NCTM 2000, p. 20)   and that “Technology enhances mathematics learning” (NCTM 2000, p. 25). As educators, we must find ways to help students learn with understanding even when such understanding appears to be beyond their reach. Technology can often bridge that gap.  4.  If we rounded to the nearest hundred thousandth, the circumference of this circle would be 3.14159; if we needed more accuracy, we could use a polygon with even more sides. For most practical purposes, the circumference measured to the nearest hundredth of a unit is close enough.  solutions",45,mtms2010-10-180a,,
