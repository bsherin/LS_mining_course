0,Seeing Dots - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Use a 6 Ã— 6 peg geoboard to investigate the following shapes and their areas.,,
1,Seeing Dots - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,1. Build as many polygons as you can that have no interior pegs. Find the area of each polygon. What is the relationship between the number of boundary points and the area?,,
2,Seeing Dots - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,2. How does the relationship between the number of boundary points and area change if you build polygons with 1 interior point?,,
3,Seeing Dots - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,3. If you build polygons with 2 interior points?,,
4,Seeing Dots - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,4. If you build polygons with 3 interior points?,,
5,Seeing Dots - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,5. Can you find a general relationship between the area of a polygon on a geoboard that relates to both the number of boundary and interior points?,,
6,Seeing Dots - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"After reviewing the submissions and teacher reflections for this task, we found that the teachers presented this problem in different ways and that the students used a variety of solution strategies. Mary Fay-Zenk presented this task to her Math Club as it appeared in print and let the exploration begin. Other teachers used it in their regular classrooms.",,
7,Seeing Dots - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Walter Stark, who believes that good problems naturally evoke discussions, said that this task sparked a discussion (and nice review) of regular and irregular polygons. After watching his students work, he noticed that they were having trouble identifying boundary and interior pegs, so he called the class together for some clarification. Jacob Wooton also found that his students needed the terminology clarified. Claire Hiller reported, as well, that she stopped her class when she felt â€œthey got hung up on the first statement: Build as many polygons as you can that have no interior pegs.â€ She then refocused their attention on the goal: Find a relationship between boundary points and area. These three teachers, who used this problem in the classroom, recognized the importance of keeping students focused on the task.",,
8,Seeing Dots - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Wooton said he encouraged his students to use a table to organize their data, whereas Hiller reported that her students generally solved the problem by drawing diagrams, making charts or organized lists, and looking for patterns. Stark asked his students to share their findings with him and pretended to be confused when trying to remember the numbers that students were using. Finally, student Alexa said to him, â€œWe need to see the numbers all together. Why donâ€™t you write them in a chart on the board?â€ These three teachers addressed the importance of organizing data for ease of comparison, but they did so in different ways. Without being prompted, Fay-Zenkâ€™s Math Club students made tables and looked for ways to generalize their information.",,
9,Seeing Dots - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Studentsâ€™ solutions attempts often began by using a geoboard or dot paper, but their methods then diverged. Many drew pictures to record polygons with differing boundary pegs and different interior pegs. These students tended to group their diagrams by the number of interior pegs noted in the problem: none, 1, 2, and 3. Paulina, a student in Wootonâ€™s class, used multiple examples to convince herself that she was seeing a pattern (see fig. 1). Her examples helped her see the pattern and develop a formula without using actual tables. She concluded, â€œWith every additional boundary point, the area increases by 0.5, and with every additional interior point, the area increases by 1.â€",,
10,Seeing Dots - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"However, some students were less systematic in their examples and found the pattern by analyzing numbers in a table or chart. Lynette, a student in Starkâ€™s class, demonstrated this strategy (see fig. 2). The students in Fay-Zenkâ€™s Math Club also organized their work in tables according to the number of interior pegs. One student, Alam, took  it a step further by using three variablesâ€”x, representing the number of boundary points; y, representing the area; and z, being the number of interior pointsâ€”to find a mathematical relationship that seemed to work each time: x = 2y â€“ 2z + 2. The other students tried many more examples and could not find any case in which this formula did not work. Fay-Zenk then asked how this formula could help them find the area of any shape if they knew the number of boundary and interior points. Alam then restated his formula: Area = BP/2 + IP â€“ 1.",,
11,Seeing Dots - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Fig. 1 Paulina produced a systematic set of examples.,,
12,Seeing Dots - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Fig. 2 Lynette analyzed her data tables to reach a conclusion.,,
13,Seeing Dots - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Wooton admitted that he was surprised to find that some of his students went beyond creating tables to graphing the ordered pairs in their tables as points and then determining the equations for the lines connecting the points. When we first looked at the student work, we wondered about this strategy because it was not necessarily one we expected to see from middle school students. However, Liam, one of Hillerâ€™s students, also attempted to look at the relationship graphically, so apparently this method was not unique to Wootonâ€™s classroom. See, for example, Noraâ€™s graphical work in figure 3, in which she demonstrated her use of graphs to see the lines, the slope, and the y-intercepts. Her work was selected because her examples contained some unique polygons. The last drawing at the bottom of the page could be a topic of discussion all its own: Is a polygon allowed to have a â€œholeâ€ in the middle? If four different sides meet at one vertex, is it a polygon?",,
14,Seeing Dots - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Fig. 2 Lynette analyzed her data tables to reach a conclusion.,,
15,Seeing Dots - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Noraâ€™s work also explained that the tables start at 3 because that is the first number of pegs that will have an area above zero. Other classmates graphed full lines and never mentioned the issue of the number of boundary pegs being less than 3, with many of their graphs representing negative values for the number of pegs. Ramsey drew his  lines to the y-axis, perhaps to see the  y-intercepts, and then clarified that â€œthese lines are simply models, in a real-life scenario . . . you cannot have 2, 1, or 0 pegs, it would not have an area.â€ Finally, you will notice that Nora never made any claims about the overall relationship between boundary points, interior points, and the area. Many students who presented the graphical representations did this, finding the equations of the parallel lines but never discussing the overall meaning. Molly, however, tried to address this issue by stating that the parallel lines showed that â€œthe relationship stays the same [between the problems with zero, one, two, and three interior pegs], but the y-intercept changes. The slope is always 0.5x.â€",,
16,Seeing Dots - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Finally, some students explored various figures and then reasoned through the problem without the aid of tables or graphs. Hillerâ€™s students, Sasha and Francis, did just that (see the salient parts of their reasoning in fig. 4). Sasha and Francisâ€™s final conclusion also showed that they were able to find the same formula that Alam had found in Fay-Zenkâ€™s Math Club and that they could use that single formula to find the area of any shape they built on the geoboard.",,
17,Seeing Dots - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,REFLECTING ON THE TASK,,
18,Seeing Dots - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"As we look back, we could have  improved the wording to help clarify the task for the students. Nonetheless, the teachers were able to provide  appropriate clarifications, and the work their students produced was enlightening in many ways.",,
19,Seeing Dots - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Students and teachers alike agreed that the exploration was worthwhile. Fay-Zenk told us that her Math Club students were delighted when they had completed the task. They had found Pickâ€™s theorem on the Internet and realized that it matched the formula that Alam discovered. We are happy that they felt the task was worth their time and effort and that they could successfully explore relationships between more than two variables.,,
20,Seeing Dots - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,We would like to thank the four teachers who sent us student work and their reflections. The teachers who participated were the following:,,
21,Seeing Dots - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Fig. 4 Sasha and Francisâ€™s reasoning involved equations.,,
22,Seeing Dots - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"3. We realized that there was definitely some sort of pattern between the number of border pegs and the area of the shape, and we knew that was key to solve the problem. We grasped this concept when we then noticed that if you divide the number of border pegs by two, it is one more than the area of any shape with no border pegs. We tested this equation with multiple different shapes with no interior pegs, and it always worked. This is an example of the first equation that we came up with. We then tried to see if there was a relationship between the number of pegs and the area in a shape with one interior peg. We found an equation, and we started noticing relationships between all shapes.",,
23,Seeing Dots - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"4. We came up with an equation for shapes with 0, 1, 2, and 3 interior pegs.",,
24,Seeing Dots - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,â€“ (Number of border pegs/two)  â€“ 1 = Area of shape with no interior pegs,,
25,Seeing Dots - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,â€“ (Number of border pegs/two) + 0 = Area of shape with one interior peg,,
26,Seeing Dots - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,â€“ (Number of border pegs/two) + 1 = Area of shape with two interior pegs,,
27,Seeing Dots - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,â€“ (Number of border pegs/two) + 2 = Area of shape with three interior pegs,,
28,Seeing Dots - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"5. We then noticed the relation between all of the equations. You divide the number of border pegs by two, and then you subtract one less than the number of interior pegs. Our final equation is",,
29,Seeing Dots - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,(Number of border pegs/two) + (Number of interior pegs â€“ 1) = Area of shape.,,
