"books navigating through Problem solving and Reasoning in grade 6 Denisse R. Thompson, Michael T. Battista, Sally Mayberry, Karol L. Yeatts, and Judith S. Zawojewski, 2009. 126 pp., $37.95 paper. Stock no. 13241. ISBN 978-0-87353-607-3. NCTM; www.nctm.org.",3,mtms2009-12-302a,,
"This book and CD-ROM offer resources to support development of sixth-grade students’ ability to problem solve and reason mathematically. Following an overview of the two Process Standards of problem solving and reasoning, five mathematical investigations are described. Each investigation addresses a different content strand with problem solving and reasoning in mind. ",4,mtms2009-12-302a,,
The book also includes a reference  section and an appendix containing blackline masters and solutions. The CD-ROM contains instructional support for the investigations (electronic copies and a java applet) and articles describing how to involve middlegrades students in problem solving and reasoning.,5,mtms2009-12-302a,,

"Investigations are grade-level  appropriate and contain significant detail regarding their implementation. Another strength is the book’s suggestions for related resources— articles, children’s literature, and Web sites. Furthermore, the authors make connections between investigations, which allow learners to encounter mathematical concepts from multiple perspectives.",7,mtms2009-12-302a,,
"What sometimes gets lost is the  explicit role that problem solving and reasoning play in investigations. A more intentional approach would support teachers who are inexperienced in focusing on and modeling mathematical processes. The last investigation, Fitness Fest, comes closest to consistently addressing where problem solving and reasoning might be highlighted. A reader starting with this investigation could annotate earlier activities with explicit ways to focus on these processes.",8,mtms2009-12-302a,,
I recommend this resource as a supplement to a sixth-grade math curriculum. Any effort required to identify how problem solving and reasoning could be highlighted in the investigations would be worth it. The Process Standards are fundamental to doing mathematics and sometimes need this kind of explicit attention.,9,mtms2009-12-302a,,

"The Basic Blitz Unit was implemented in an art class of more than  30 sixth graders. The teacher used math terms (e.g., half, fourths,  rotation), not origami terms (e.g., valley fold, mountain fold, squash fold) when guiding students through creating individual origami. ",12,mtms2009-12-302a,,
"Students’ origami was combined to  create a six-unit Basic Blintz, which is a great time-management strategy. When working with a group to combine six individual Blitz Units into one, the teacher asked students to evaluate the polygon properties by writing and explaining their responses. One of six groups independently combined their Blitz Units into one unit. The process of combining and creating a single Blitz Unit, and the evaluation of the polygon properties, took fifty minutes. ",13,mtms2009-12-302a,,
The book’s strengths include   (1) explaining the symbols and terminology and (2) applying mathematics to the planar models. The diagrams in the book help users follow along. ,14,mtms2009-12-302a,,
"The book’s weaknesses include the  need for readers to become familiar with origami symbols and terminology. In addition, the book is missing the math applications that teachers would hope to find. That said, I recommend this book for math teachers who want to collaborate with art teachers.",15,mtms2009-12-302a,,

"If you are looking for a book that will provide interesting activities and ready-made lessons, this book will not help you. However, if you work in elementary school education as an administrator or teacher and find yourself exasperated while trying to help students with learning differences, this book will give you food for thought and a fresh perspective on teaching this group. The authors offer a content framework that targets instructional methodology and arithmetic.",20,mtms2009-12-302a,,
"For starters, the authors present an unconventional approach; they focus on problem solving rather than computational mastery. Since students will be using math across the curriculum, the authors emphasize the value of developing problem-solving skills so that these students can connect  math to other subjects. As students progress along the problem-solving continuum, they then develop computational mastery.",21,mtms2009-12-302a,,
"Teachers receive continuous  feedback through a Present Level of Functioning (PLF), which allows them to determine an individual’s consistent level of performance. The authors also describe Interactive Units (IUs), which are used as a monitoring tool. These tools allow for differentiated instruction and expectations for each student. ",22,mtms2009-12-302a,,
"Finally, the authors discuss the  need for students to develop and use alternative algorithms, which lead to higher understanding and improved mathematical communication.",23,mtms2009-12-302a,,

This product contains 186 octagonal numbered pieces that are magnetic and in color. The numbered pieces are easy to handle. ,25,mtms2009-12-302a,,
The purpose of the product is  to create an enjoyable investigation into number patterns using colored shapes to highlight those patterns and relationships. The audience includes grades 6−8 students in prealgebra and algebra 1. ,26,mtms2009-12-302a,,
The strengths are that the number patterns support instruction in the following ways: 1. Counting 2. Even/odd numbers 3. Prime numbers 4. Multiplication  5. Factors of numbers 6. Squared numbers 7. Cubed numbers 8. Divisibility rules 9. Factorials 10. Binomial coefficients 11. Fibonacci numbers 12. Triangular numbers,27,mtms2009-12-302a,,
The worksheets are well constructed and contain guided questions and independent practice. ,28,mtms2009-12-302a,,
"I think the product is excellent  because the number tiles are colorful, the shapes are easy to arrange, the information written on each tile lets the user observe the number patterns quickly, and the worksheets are excellent guides for lesson preparation.  —C.
