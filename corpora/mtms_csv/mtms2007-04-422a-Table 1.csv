"Standard is that mathematics instruction preK–12 should “enable all students to recognize and apply mathematics in contexts outside of mathematics”  (nCTm  2000,  p.  64).  art  of  all  kinds provides  opportunities  to  address  this  goal.  moreover, many mathematics educators, including myself, believe that it is important and beneficial to provide a multicultural perspective in our classrooms. “Knowledge of the ideas of others can enlarge our view of what is mathematical and, in particular, add a more humanistic  and  global  perspective  to  the  history  of mathematics. This enlarged view, in which mathematical ideas are seen to play a vital role in diverse human endeavors, provides us with a richer and fuller picture of mathematics” (ascher 2002, p. 200).",4,mtms2007-04-422a,,
"I had given the art department in our school several books about kolam, traditional designs placed on the thresholds of homes in Tamil nadu near my birthplace in  southern  India  (see  the  sidebar  on  p.  425).  I  was thrilled to hear that some of my students were learning about and making these designs in their art classes. as a mathematics teacher, I felt I could not let this opportunity  slip  by.  Thus  began  a  two-week  period  during which my sixth-grade classes spent a part of each mathematics class exploring the mathematics of kolam. ",5,mtms2007-04-422a,,

"DurInG The fIrST Day Of ThIS STuDy, I InTrOduced  the  students  to  some  basic  definitions  of graph theory: •	 Graph:  a  set  of  vertices  (points)  connected  by  edges (line segments or curves)",7,mtms2007-04-422a,,

The  students  worked  with  a  few  simple  graphs  to identify  these  features  and  clarify  their  definitions (see fig. 1).,12,mtms2007-04-422a,,
"I  then  explained  to  the  students  that  the  Swiss B mathematician leonhard euler did much of the early work with graph theory. They were familiar with euler, so this added to their interest. I explained that a graph has an Euler path if every edge can be traced without going over the same edge more than once. also, a graph has an Euler circuit if the path starts and ends at the same point.",13,mtms2007-04-422a,,
each student received a copy of the graphs shown in figure 2. Their tasks were to see whether the edges of each graph could be traced without lifting their pencils and to make conjectures about the characteristics of graphs that are euler paths and/or circuits.,14,mtms2007-04-422a,,
"after the students had worked for a few minutes, I asked whether they had any suggestions for characteristics that might be important in determining whether a graph contains an euler path or an euler circuit. The characteristics suggested by students included the symmetry of the graph and “something about the vertices.” The students talked in small groups and then decided on the headings for a table in which they would record ",15,mtms2007-04-422a,,

",23,mtms2007-04-422a,,
"When  students  arrived  the  next  day,  they  were excited to share their conjectures. They first verified the  information  they  had  recorded  in  their  tables. for several of the graphs, this step required a student coming to the board, drawing the graph, and demonstrating his or her method of tracing. In each class,  the  students  eventually  agreed  on  the  data shown in table 1. a common problem for students was their failure to remember that a loop counts as one edge but adds two to the degree of its vertex.",24,mtms2007-04-422a,,
"many conjectures were offered about vertices in graphs and the characteristics that are important in determining whether a graph contains an euler path or an euler circuit. after much discussion over two days, the classes concurred on the following: •	 you cannot have an odd number of odd vertices. Gabe explained, “Start with a graph that has all even vertices. make one of the vertices odd by adding  another  edge.  at  the  other  end  of  that edge, there will always be another odd vertex.” •	 If all vertices of a graph are even, it has an euler path and an euler circuit. emma offered, “Since each  vertex  has  an  even  number  of  edges  connected to it, for every edge that enters each vertex, there is a ‘partner edge’ to leave by.”",25,mtms2007-04-422a,,
"Fig. 3   An example of kolam without reflection symmetry •	 Symmetry does not seem to be a characteristic that determines whether a graph will contain an euler  path  or  an  euler  circuit,  although  all  the graphs  found  so  far  have  reflection  symmetry. (note:  later  in  their  work  with  kolam,  the  students found many examples of graphs with both euler paths and circuits that did not have reflection symmetry. See the example in fig. 3.) •	 If a graph has exactly two odd vertices, it has an euler  path.  James  said  that  he  thought  of  this characteristic  because  he  noticed  this  pattern in the table’s data. he then “tried drawing some  ",26,mtms2007-04-422a,,
Kolam: A Living Art of India,27,mtms2007-04-422a,,
"Kolam (in Tamil), muggu (in Telugu), or rangoli (in hindi) is a decorative design drawn by women in front of their homes as a welcome mat. It is a line drawing containing loops drawn around patterns  of  dots  that  is  generally  symmetrical.  The designs are drawn using rice powder and, for longevity, diluted rice paste or even paint. In addition, some people in India use limestone and red brick powder to produce a contrasting color scheme. ",28,mtms2007-04-422a,,
"Traditionally,  every  morning  before  sunrise, the ground in front of the house is cleaned with water and swept to give a smooth surface. The water may be mixed with a little cow dung, and the kolam is drawn while the surface is still damp. although the kolam is a decoration, the rice powder it is drawn with also serves as a meal for ants and birds. In addition, kolam is a welcoming sign to all who enter the home, including lakshmi, the goddess of wealth and prosperity. The story goes that the lines must be completed so as to prevent evil  spirits  from  entering  the  shapes,  thus  preventing their entry into the home.",29,mtms2007-04-422a,,
"modern  kolam  are  sometimes  drawn  with chalk and augmented with vinyl stickers, but this practice takes away from the art form and loses the physical advantage of an artist bending and working at the patterns.",30,mtms2007-04-422a,,
"other  graphs  and  figured  out  that  you  have  to start at one of the odd vertexes and end at the other one to trace the graph completely without going  over  any  edge  twice.”  lily  added,  “This makes sense, since the odd number of edges at those vertices allows you to ‘come in and go out of’ the vertex a certain number of times with one left over—one odd vertex for the starting point and the other odd vertex for the ending point.” •	 If a graph has more than two odd vertices, it cannot be traced without repeating an edge and, therefore, it does not have an euler path or an euler circuit. The  students  based  this  conjecture  on  their  exhaustive efforts to trace graphs 2 and 4 in figure 2 plus additional graphs they created themselves. They were thrilled when this conjecture continued to hold throughout their remaining investigations.",31,mtms2007-04-422a,,
I was pleased that the students had learned a little graph theory and had also used algebraic thinking in finding and verifying patterns and mathematical reasoning  to  support  their  conjectures.  They  also worked  together  and  communicated  their  ideas both orally and in writing. ,32,mtms2007-04-422a,,
"The Mathematics of Kolam TO  BeGIn  The  InVeSTIGaTIOnS  Of  The  maThematics of kolam, we first reviewed what the students had learned about the art (see the sidebar at left). I then asked each class to brainstorm about some mathematical questions we might investigate related to these designs.",33,mtms2007-04-422a,,
"Since all the kolam that my students had created in art class were essentially a geometric design comprising straight or curved lines against a framework of dots (called pulli), they posed a number of questions that led to several engaging mathematical investigations, as described below. ",34,mtms2007-04-422a,,
"What are the different arrangements of pulli that are used? Is there a way to find the total number of pulli  in  kolam  without  counting  them  one  by  one? although  the  students  had  worked  with  several kolam, they decided to restrict this investigation to two simple types that included most of the designs they produced (with a few variations). an example of each type of kolam is shown in figure 4. ",35,mtms2007-04-422a,,
"One type is a square array, most often designed with an odd number of rows and columns. for this type of kolam, the total number of pulli is, of course,  n • n, or n2, where n is the number of pulli in one row.",36,mtms2007-04-422a,,
"The second type of arrangement has a center row that  always  contains  an  odd  number  of  pulli.  The number of pulli in each successive row, above and below the center row, decreases by two until the top and bottom rows each contain only one pulli. Working in pairs or small groups and sharing among groups, the students worked diligently to discover the following: 1.  The sum of any group of increasing odd numbers is always a square number (e.g., 1 + 3 + 5 = 9 and 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16).",37,mtms2007-04-422a,,
"2.  The sum of r rows of increasing odd numbers is  r 2 (e.g., for 1 + 3 + 5, there are 3 rows, so the sum is 32, or 9).",38,mtms2007-04-422a,,
pulli are shown here in a square array.,39,mtms2007-04-422a,,

"Fig. 6  Students’ symmetrical kolam 3.  If  n  is  the  number  of  pulli  in  the  center  row  of this type of kolam, then (n + 1)/2 is the number of rows in half of the kolam, including the center row (e.g., for kolam with rows containing 1, 3, 5, 3, 1 pulli, (5 + 1)/2 = 3 rows).",46,mtms2007-04-422a,,
4.  Then ((n + 1)/2)2 is the sum of those rows (from  step number 2).,47,mtms2007-04-422a,,
"5.  So 2((n + 1)/2)2 is the sum of all the rows; however, this expression counts the center row of pulli twice, so 2((n + 1)/2)2 – n is the total number of pulli. another class, using similar reasoning, found the rule  total pulli = 2((n – 1)/2)2 + n, when n is the number of pulli in the center row.",48,mtms2007-04-422a,,
"Do kolam contain Euler paths or Euler circuits? The students examined the kolam that they had made in art class to find the answer. They first tried to eliminate the possibility of euler paths and euler circuits by finding disconnected parts or more than two odd vertices in each of their designs. after this step, students were surprised at the number of choices they had to make when trying to trace over the designs without  retracing  any  edge.  In  the  end,  they  found that many of the kolam, despite appearing otherwise, are  one  continuous  path  and,  therefore,  are  euler  paths and euler circuits. Some of them are shown in figure 5. The black dot in each drawing shows the start and end of the tracing that the student used. ",49,mtms2007-04-422a,,

Some examples of symmetrical kolam are shown in figure 6.",52,mtms2007-04-422a,,
"Are  there  mathematical  relationships  among  the numbers of pulli, intersections, and edges in kolam? One student read online that, for a certain type of kolam, there are always the same relationships among the numbers of these features.

"Connecting Art and Mathematics “We’ve been studying kolam in art and math classes. There’s a lot of math in these designs—their symmetry,  the  paths  and  circuits  they  have  in  them, and all the number patterns and rules you can find. But  there’s  also  immense  beauty.  The  shapes,  the designs, the colors, and the symbols and traditions they show. They are considered ephemeral or temporary art, but I think the traditions and the connections between generations last a long time, just like the mathematics they contain.”—Evie",72,mtms2007-04-422a,,

Or I’m the DC Tour Guide, or the parking meter person, mailman, or  in  charge  of  garbage  removal.  I  want  to  go  everywhere I need to just once and return to where I began. now there’s one more way I never knew. The women of India actually have euler circuits and paths in the kolam designs they create as a part of their everyday life. euler might not have thought of them, but I’m glad someone did.
