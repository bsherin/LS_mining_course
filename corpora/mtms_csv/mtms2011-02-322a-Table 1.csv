"Geometry is one of the oldest branches of mathematics. Many important mathematical ideas and theorems are rooted in geometry and can be visualized using geometric interpretations. Students learn about shapes, their properties, and the methods of calculating perimeters and areas of basic shapes early in their school years. Geometry can and should be used to help students visualize and better understand a broad range of mathematical concepts. In the following activity, students use the concepts of area and length to help them understand an important algebraic idea.",2,mtms2011-02-322a,,
Fig. 1 Students are asked to cut a 1 in. × 1 in. square from one corner of a 4 in. × 4 in. square.,3,mtms2011-02-322a,,
"Students begin this activity with a 4 in. × 4 in. square piece of paper. Students know that the area of this square is 16 square inches. At this point, I remind them that we could fi t sixteen 1 in. × 1 in. squares inside our square. Next, students cut a single 1-inch square from one corner. (See fi g. 1.) Some students like to take the 1-inch square and repeatedly trace it inside the 4-inch square to verify that it will take exactly 16 of them to cover the entire original square.",4,mtms2011-02-322a,,
Students can use geometric terminology as they discuss these two new shapes. Shape A is a square with area of 1 square inch. Shape B is a concave hexagon with area of 15 square inches. ,5,mtms2011-02-322a,,
"Students automatically know that shape B is 15 square inches because it was originally 16 square inches, but 1 inch has been removed. It is important to draw students’ attention to the different possible ways that they can describe what they did using correct terminology. ",6,mtms2011-02-322a,,
"Consider shape B. If we did not know its area, we could break it into rectangles to make the calculation easier. Ask students to divide shape B into two rectangles, as in fi gure 2a. We can then label the remaining rectangles shape C and shape D.",7,mtms2011-02-322a,,

Send submissions to this department by accessing mtms.msubmit.net.  combine rectangles C and D into one big rectangle because the length of rectangle D is equal to the width of rectangle C. The lengths of the sides of both rectangles can be labeled. That way, students can more easily see which pairs of sides match when they form the new rectangle from the two rectangles and the resulting dimensions of that new rectangle. Using the rectangles in figure 2a, students can construct one rectangle whose dimensions are 3 in. × 5 in. (see fig. 2b).",9,mtms2011-02-322a,,
Ask students to discuss a few questions about the process they have just completed:  •  Is it a coincidence that the sides of  the rectangle are 1 fewer and  1 more than the sides of the original square?  •  Is this construction connected to the fact that the cutout square is  1 in. × 1 in.? ,10,mtms2011-02-322a,,
"Fig. 2 After cutting a square from one corner, the remaining figure can be divided into two rectangles and rearranged to form a single rectangle.",11,mtms2011-02-322a,,

Usually I ask students to work  in small groups on two squares that are different from the 4 in. × 4 in. square with 1 in. × 1 in. cut out that we discussed as a class. Different groups choosing different numbers ,13,mtms2011-02-322a,,
