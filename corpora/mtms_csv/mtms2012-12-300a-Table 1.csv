"in our lives. Citizens need to be able to conduct critical analyses of statistical information in the work place, in their personal lives, and when portrayed by the media. However, becoming a conscientious consumer of statistics is a gradual process. The experiences that students have with data in the middle grades can potentially lay the foundation for developing statistical reasoning. Principles and Standards for School Mathematics contends that students should be able to “select and use appropriate statistical measures to analyze data” (NCTM 2000, p. 250), which includes understanding how a mean balances a data set and comparings when they experience the mean in ways that transcend the add-anddivide algorithm.",6,mtms2012-12-300a,,
"Past research has provided insight  into what students think is meant by the term average. For example, Mokros and Russell (1995) described fi ve predominant approaches that middle-grades students display as they reason about the concept of the arithmetic mean. The most advanced of these approaches involves conceiving of the mean as a “mathematical point of balance.” As characterized by Mokros and Russell (1995, p. 26), the following qualities are often found when students view the mean as a mathematical point of balance: •   They view an average as a tool for  making sense of the data.  •  They look for a point of balance to  represent the data.  •  They account for the values of all  the data points.  •  They use the mean with a beginning understanding of the quantitative relationships among data, total, and average.",7,mtms2012-12-300a,,
"•  They are able to work from a given average to data, from a given average to total, and from a given total to data.  •  They break problems into smaller parts and fi nd “submeans” as a way to solve more diffi cult averaging problems. ",8,mtms2012-12-300a,,
Fig. 1 these calculations establish that the mean is 6 for this set of data and that the sum of the deviations from the mean is 0.,9,mtms2012-12-300a,,

"understanding. The tasks, designed to foster students’ mathematical understanding of the mean, were developed during a research study designed to investigate how students think about the mean.",11,mtms2012-12-300a,,
"The student participants were a diverse set of fi fth through seventh graders who attended multiple schools. The mathematical abilities of the students were wide ranging; some students struggled in mathematics, whereas others participated in honors mathematics classes. The students were all enrolled in a university-sponsored summer enrichment program and all chose to take part in the research. (All names used in this article are pseudonyms.) During the study, I served as both a researcher and teacher, posing tasks to students to elicit thinking.  the elUsiVe Mean",12,mtms2012-12-300a,,
"Among the different measures of center (median, mode, and so on), the mean can often be the most elusive concept for students to understand because it requires both additive and multiplicative reasoning. Many students have signifi cant misconceptions about the mean because their early experiences with it are often limited to the add-and-divide algorithm. Furthermore, many students do not interpret the mean as representing a data set.",13,mtms2012-12-300a,,
"For example, when I asked Chad and Lucy to estimate the average of the data set {4, 7, 8, 12, 16} without calculating, Chad said 31, and Lucy replied 35. These students’ responses suggest that they had not established important conceptions, such as the fact that a mean is between the minimum and maximum values of a data set or serves as a representative number of the data set. To prepare students to analyze and make sense of complex data, they need more robust understandings about the mean. Students can construct such understand-",14,mtms2012-12-300a,,
"Central to students’ conceptualization of the mean as a mathematical balance point is the idea that within data sets, the sums of the deviations from the mean are 0. In other words, if one subtracts the mean from each data point, the sum of the set of differences will be 0. Figure 1 demonstrates how the sum of the deviations from the mean is 0 for the given data set, which has a mean of 6. Graphically, these deviations represent the distance between a data value and the mean on a number line (see fig. 2). A consequence of this property is that for all data sets, the sum of the distances from each value to the left of the mean on a number line is equal to the sum of the distances from each value to the right of the mean.",15,mtms2012-12-300a,,
"The metaphor of a “balance point”  describes this property because the position of the mean on a number line is similar to the position of a fulcrum. For example, a block that is 6 inches away from the fulcrum will balance with two blocks of the same weight that are 3 inches away or two blocks that are 2 and 4 inches away from the fulcrum. Similarly, in a representation like that in figure 2, students who view the mean as a mathematical balance point can understand the mean as being a “central” point in regard to the deviations from the mean.",16,mtms2012-12-300a,,
"Why is it important for students to develop a conception of the mean as a mathematical balance point? This view is connected to many other conceptual ideas that are important for students to develop to use statistics wisely. To become judicious users of statistics, students need to understand the impact on the mean of adding new data points to the set. If the value of a new datum is greater than the original mean, the new mean will be larger. If the value is less than the original mean, the new mean will be smaller. The Common Core State Standards for Mathematics note that ",17,mtms2012-12-300a,,
The position of the  mean is similar to the position of a fulcrum.,18,mtms2012-12-300a,,
"students should relate “the choice of measures of center and variability to the shape of the data distribution and the context in which the data were gathered” (CCSSI 2010, p. 45; Standard 6.SP.5d). The mean as a mathematical balance point is important for teachers to include to meet curricular expectations. ",19,mtms2012-12-300a,,
"However, a prerequisite for  evaluating which measure of center is appropriate is an understanding of the impact of outliers on the mean and median. Students’ reasoning about why outliers typically have a greater impact on the mean than the median is directly related to whether students recognize the mean as a mathematical point of balance.",20,mtms2012-12-300a,,
target Practice,21,mtms2012-12-300a,,
"To develop students’ conceptions of the mean as a mathematical point of balance, I designed a set of tasks known collectively as “target practice.” Throughout their work on the tasks, students used the TinkerPlots® Dynamic Data™ Exploration software (Konold and Miller 2005) to investigate the mean. Each “target practice” data set elicited various activities:    1.  Students estimated the value of the  mean using the dot plot.",22,mtms2012-12-300a,,
"2.  Using TinkerPlots, students found  the actual value of the mean and compared it with their estimate.",23,mtms2012-12-300a,,
"3.  Students added a point to the given data set so that the mean would change to a given “target” mean. Initially, the target mean was 10.",24,mtms2012-12-300a,,
4.  Students guessed where they  believed the target mean would be located and checked their outcome by adding a value to TinkerPlots. ,25,mtms2012-12-300a,,
The phrase target practice emerged as a descriptor for these activities because students needed to add values to arrive at a target mean and the tool used to add new values in TinkerPlots resembles crosshairs. ,26,mtms2012-12-300a,,
"This set of activities can potentially  reveal what misconceptions students hold about the mean, similar to my experience with Chad’s and Lucy’s overestimation of the mean of {4, 7, 8, 12, 16}. When posed with their first target practice game, Chad and Lucy were surprised to find that the mean of this data set was actually 9.4. When they were asked to identify what value should be added to the data set to produce a mean of 10, they agreed on “0.6.”  This answer indicated that they viewed the relationship between a data value and the mean as purely ",27,mtms2012-12-300a,,
"Fig. 3 Students were asked to add a point to this data set so that the mean was 10.  additive. These students did not recognize that by adding a data value that was less than the mean, the mean would decrease. ",28,mtms2012-12-300a,,
"TinkerPlots provided an important opportunity for students to investigate and revise such conjectures. I suggested to these two students that they should add a new data value of 0.6. They then noticed that the mean decreased to 7.9333. . . . Chad exclaimed, “It went down! I thought it’d go up.” Students need opportunities to explore the effect on individual data points on the mean. TinkerPlots allows students to click and drag individual data points to change the value. In doing so, the software dynamically changes all linked values, including the mean or other measures of center (see fi g. 3).",29,mtms2012-12-300a,,
deViations as distances FroM the Mean,30,mtms2012-12-300a,,
"Most students were not responding to tasks in ways that showed that they thought of the mean as a mathematical point of balance. Therefore, I presented a different set of problems called “deviation tasks.” These data sets were shown using TinkerPlots; however, similar paper-and-pencilbased activities could work equally well and provoke engaging discussions. Students were given a data set and  its mean and asked to tell how far each data value was from the mean for the data set. After using TinkerPlots to create a representation similar to fi gure 4, Carrie said, ",31,mtms2012-12-300a,,
"If I took 1 from the 9 and added it to here [pointing to 2], it’d be the same ",32,mtms2012-12-300a,,
"Fig. 4 in this exploration of deviation, the student calculated the sums of distances by hand.",33,mtms2012-12-300a,,
exact thing on both sides. They both add up to 11.,34,mtms2012-12-300a,,
"Although she initially conjectured that the sums might also indicate the value of the mean, she later realized that although the two “sides” of the mean had equal sums, the sums were not always the same as the mean. Although Carrie noticed this relationship between the deviations on each side after just two deviation problems, not all students found this relationship immediately. TinkerPlots provides a ruler tool that can be used to measure and sum absolu te distances between data values or between the mean and a particular data value (see fi g. 5). However, I  recommend having students initially construct the differences with the drawing tool to help them understand and create a need for the ruler tool before it is introduced. ",35,mtms2012-12-300a,,
"After completing this activity for three or four data sets and having the students compare the data, I posed open-ended questions to the students: “What do you notice about these data sets? What do they have in common?",36,mtms2012-12-300a,,
"What is different?” If students did not mention some aspect of the deviations,",37,mtms2012-12-300a,,
"I probed further by asking, “Do you notice anything about the numbers on the right side of the mean and the numbers on the left?” For the problem in fi gure 4, students responded, “They  both equal the same; 8 + 3 = 11 and 9 + 2 = 11.” Then, I had them check whether that was true of other data sets. Most of the data sets were small (involving only two to four data values on each side of the mean), so it was not diffi cult for students to check this conjecture. ",38,mtms2012-12-300a,,
MaKing Progress With More target Practice,39,mtms2012-12-300a,,
"Following completion and discussion of four deviation activities, I posed a number of other target practice problems. Most students used their new knowledge of the deviations from the mean to develop more reasonable estimates about where the new data point should be placed. They chose estimated means that fell between the maximum and minimum of the value and were more likely to estimate means near the center of the data. ",40,mtms2012-12-300a,,
Fig. 5 the ruler tool can be used to quickly measure and sum absolute differences.,41,mtms2012-12-300a,,
"These activities also provided a way  to talk about the impact that individual points can have on a mean. For example, in responding to the data set shown in fi gure 6, Carrie believed the  mean would be near 12. The actual mean is slightly less than 11. When I asked her why, she responded, “Because there’s barely anything over here [on the left]. It’s all quite crowded ",42,mtms2012-12-300a,,

"over there [on the right].” I asked her, “What happens when we have one way out there like that 6?” Carrie responded, “It pulls the average with it.” In this sense, Carrie was considering the mean as a mathematical balance point because the mean provided a way for her to look for a visual center in the data set, which was inﬂ uenced by outliers.",48,mtms2012-12-300a,,
"The target practice problems also allowed students to begin to see the effect of adding new data points to the data set. In particular, they found that when they added a data point above a data set’s mean, the mean would increase. Similarly, when they added a data point below the data set’s mean, it would decrease.",49,mtms2012-12-300a,,
"The dynamic nature of TinkerPlots played a pivotal role in helping students make this connection because the software dynamically changed when new points were added. Students instantly saw changes in the value of the mean on the dot plot as they added new points. The drag value tool in TinkerPlots also allowed the students to click on a particular data point to modify it. As a result, TinkerPlots simultaneously changed the corresponding value in any tables as well as any measures (like mean or median) that used that data point.",50,mtms2012-12-300a,,
"The technology gave students the opportunity to test their conjectures immediately, and when necessary, to change and recheck new conjectures. When asked what happens to the mean as a new data value was dragged down, the students would respond, “Oh, it goes down and changes.” When another student asked them to  “go up,” a student said, “It gets higher. That is so cool. I wish we knew about that earlier. That will make it [target practice problems] a lot easier.” Creating and investigating conjectures is valuable for developing persistent problem-solving skills. Although the technology afforded important opportunities, the target practice problems could easily be adapted to be implemented with pencil and paper alone or with a calculator.",51,mtms2012-12-300a,,
"stUdent-created target Practice As a challenge, I encouraged students to develop target practice problems for other groups to solve. As part of the activity, the students were required to develop a data set, enter the data into TinkerPlots, and identify a target mean. Then, they shared their data set with another group who had to identify the data value that needed to be added to the data set to produce the specifi ed mean. ",52,mtms2012-12-300a,,
"Creating their own problems  allowed students to construct new ideas about the mean. For example, one group identifi ed a target mean and then chose corresponding data values. However, the data values were far above the target mean. When the other group attempted to solve the problem, the new data point (i.e., the solution) was a negative number. By working on and solving this problem, students learned that when the mean is a signifi cant distance away from the students’ visual center of the data, this may indicate that an outlier exists in the data.",53,mtms2012-12-300a,,
considering data: an ongoing Process,54,mtms2012-12-300a,,
"If one goal of statistics education in the middle grades is for students to develop robust conceptions of the mean that move beyond routine add-and-divide algorithmic thinking, tasks are necessary that help students construct such understanding. The sequence of tasks described is intended to provide teachers with insight about activities that can elicit balance-point reasoning about the mean. The goal is to help students understand the mean as a mathematical point of balance. We will then be instilling in them the mathematical thinking necessary to analyze and interpret statistical situations, resolving students’ misconceptions about the mean, and preparing students to consider deviations—all of which will be extended in future courses to measure variability and make inferences about data sets.
