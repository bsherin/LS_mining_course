A week after the activity was completed, Smith’s students took a quiz in which they demonstrated a strong retention of the ideas that had been developed in the task, without relying on rotememorized formulas. Excerpts from the quiz will also be discussed.",2,Mathematical Explorations: Find the Distance: No Formula Necessary
3,Mathematical Explorations: Find the Distance: No Formula Necessary,"When students perform repeated calculations, that action helps them acquire a feel for the concept at hand and also helps to naturally unveil the underlying theory. This repeatedcalculation strategy also ties in with one of the Common Core’s Standards for Mathematical Practice, “Look for and express regularity in repeated reasoning” (CCSSI 2010, p. 7). In the activity described below, students develop mathematical ideas on their own by using concrete examples to derive generalizations. They conduct experiments, look for patterns, make conjectures, and uncover structures and connections—all before formulas and theorems are introduced.",3,Mathematical Explorations: Find the Distance: No Formula Necessary
4,Mathematical Explorations: Find the Distance: No Formula Necessary,"Smith’s students had already taken  some type of algebra course in the eighth grade. Before being assigned the lesson on finding distances, they learned about the Pythagorean theorem and how to use it to find side lengths of right triangles. Students spent 100 minutes over two class periods working through activity sheet 1. On day 1, problems 1 through 6 were completed; on day 2, the remainder of the sheet was finished. Graph paper and rulers were provided. Activity sheet 2, which Smith’s class did not complete, contains additional problems for further enrichment. It may be ",4,Mathematical Explorations: Find the Distance: No Formula Necessary

6,Mathematical Explorations: Find the Distance: No Formula Necessary,"This activity, to find the distance  between any two points in a coordinate plane, was used in three classrooms in grades 7–9. The narrative below focuses on its use in Yu Yan Xu’s ninthgrade algebra 2/geometry class. We will describe the activity, as well as how her students fared with the explora- used as an extension (either in class or for homework) for those students who are ready for it. ",6,Mathematical Explorations: Find the Distance: No Formula Necessary
7,Mathematical Explorations: Find the Distance: No Formula Necessary,"Problem 1 on activity sheet 1,  which asked students to fi nd the distance between A(-1, -4) and B(2, 3), launched the activity and introduced the main goal of the lesson. The underlying assumption is that students will not know immediately how to approach the launch—and most of Smith’s students did not. She used the problem to review plotting points on a coordinate plane. She also reassured her students that they would be able to solve this problem by the end of the activity. ",7,Mathematical Explorations: Find the Distance: No Formula Necessary
8,Mathematical Explorations: Find the Distance: No Formula Necessary,"Students then discussed problems 2 through 4, which asked for the distance between A and B when segment AB is horizontal, or parallel to the xaxis (see ﬁ g. 1). Many students initially counted the grid boxes to fi nd the distance because the numbers were small. But after seeing problem 4, they said, “We don’t have enough boxes [in the graph paper] to count.” Some students then shared their approach of fi nding the difference of the x-coordinates of the two points. Smith noted that after repeating the same process a few times, students recognized the rhythm in these calculations (Cuoco, Goldenberg, and Mark 2010) and understood the connection between subtracting the x-coordinates and fi nding the segment length.",8,Mathematical Explorations: Find the Distance: No Formula Necessary
9,Mathematical Explorations: Find the Distance: No Formula Necessary,"This connection was further  strengthened when Smith asked her students to label the points they plotted, so that they could explicitly see the coordinates with which they were working. When discussing problem 2, some students suggested the calculation 10 – 3; others claimed 3 – 10. When Smith reminded them that distance must be a positive number, students agreed to take the absolute value of the difference, regardless of the order of subtraction.",9,Mathematical Explorations: Find the Distance: No Formula Necessary

11,Mathematical Explorations: Find the Distance: No Formula Necessary,"Fig. 1 Problem 2 from activity sheet 1 asked students to fi nd the distance between A(3, 2) and B(10, 2). Note that segment AB is horizontal, or parallel to the x-axis.",11,Mathematical Explorations: Find the Distance: No Formula Necessary
12,Mathematical Explorations: Find the Distance: No Formula Necessary,"Fig. 2 For problem 7, students worked with right triangle ABC with vertices A(3, 2), B(–1, 5), and C(–1, 2) to fi nd the length of each side of the triangle.  experiences from problems 2 through 4 to verbally describe how to fi nd the horizontal distance between A and B. A typical response was this: “Subtract one [x-coordinate] from the other and take the absolute value.” For students who had trouble articulating the process, Smith suggested that they look back at earlier examples. She also gave the class extra examples and asked them to repeat this process until they could describe the general approach more precisely. Problem 5b asked for an algebraic formula for the distance between A(x1, 2) and B(x2, 2). Students  were confused about the notation and asked, “What are x1 and x2?” Even after Smith reminded them that those variables could represent any two numbers, they asked, “How do we do the subtraction if we don’t know what they are?”",12,Mathematical Explorations: Find the Distance: No Formula Necessary
13,Mathematical Explorations: Find the Distance: No Formula Necessary,"Smith noted that transitioning  from verbal descriptions to algebraic expressions for students was extremely diffi cult. She said, “My students haven’t used algebra in that sense. They’ve used x when solving equations, but not to represent and abstract words into symbols. This is their fi rst ",13,Mathematical Explorations: Find the Distance: No Formula Necessary
14,Mathematical Explorations: Find the Distance: No Formula Necessary,"Fig. 3 Problem 10 asked students for the distance between A(–1, –4) and B(2, 3). They constructed their own right triangle by placing point C at either (2, –4) or (–1, 3). A teacher might also ask why students obtained the same distance AB = 358, regardless of the choice of point C.",14,Mathematical Explorations: Find the Distance: No Formula Necessary
15,Mathematical Explorations: Find the Distance: No Formula Necessary,"Fig. 4 Students gave these sample solutions to the quiz question that asked them to fi nd the distance between (4, 5) and (–1, 7).",15,Mathematical Explorations: Find the Distance: No Formula Necessary

17,Mathematical Explorations: Find the Distance: No Formula Necessary,"Then Smith had students work on problem 6, fi nding the distance between A(-1, y1) and B(-1, y2). Given their experiences with problem 5, students were more confi dent using symbols, and half the class was able to write the symbolic formula. Students noted, “It’s kind of similar to what we did in number 5, right?” Smith encouraged those who were stuck to experiment by creating their own examples, such as A(-1, 3) and B(-1, 10).",17,Mathematical Explorations: Find the Distance: No Formula Necessary
18,Mathematical Explorations: Find the Distance: No Formula Necessary,"The next day, students worked on  the second page of activity sheet 1, building on what they had learned about fi nding the lengths of horizontal and vertical line segments to fi nd the distance between any two points. Problems 7 through 9 went smoothly. Students sketched right triangle ABC, then found the lengths of its legs and its hypotenuse length using the Pythagorean theorem (see ﬁ g. 2). For those who could not keep track of which coordinates (x or y) to use for which leg, Smith asked them to refer to problem 2: “Are we going horizontally or vertically when the x-coordinates change?” ",18,Mathematical Explorations: Find the Distance: No Formula Necessary
19,Mathematical Explorations: Find the Distance: No Formula Necessary,"After these repeated calculations, a third of the students had acquired enough experience to grasp the general concept. They were able to solve problem 10—the launch problem of fi nding the distance between A(-1, -4) and B(2, 3)—by constructing their own right triangle and applying the Pythagorean theorem (see ﬁ g. 3). To those who continued to struggle, Smith suggested that they look at problems 7 through 9 again. After that connection was made, they were able to complete problem 10. In problem 11, students could describe in words how to fi nd the  distance between any two points. But prodding from Smith was needed until their descriptions were complete. Initially, many simply said, “Use the Pythagorean theorem.” Smith asked, “How do you use it? What information do you need?” After discussions about earlier examples, students could eventually articulate what to do:  “Locate the third point that makes a right triangle. Find the horizontal and vertical distances as done earlier: Those are the legs of the right triangle. Then use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse.”",19,Mathematical Explorations: Find the Distance: No Formula Necessary
20,Mathematical Explorations: Find the Distance: No Formula Necessary,"Although students understood the  concrete examples and could articulate their process verbally, deriving an algebraic formula for problem 12 was beyond their grasp. (Note: The coordinates given in problem 12 are meant to generalize those from problem 10.) However, when Smith presented the distance formula ) ,",20,Mathematical Explorations: Find the Distance: No Formula Necessary
21,Mathematical Explorations: Find the Distance: No Formula Necessary,"AB 58, students understood its individual components (e.g., x1 – x2 refers to the horizontal distance, or one of the legs of the right triangle) and how the formula reflected the process they used to find the distance. Smith also commented on the difficulty her students faced with the expression x1 – x2:",21,Mathematical Explorations: Find the Distance: No Formula Necessary
22,Mathematical Explorations: Find the Distance: No Formula Necessary,"They understood that it represents the horizontal distance, but they wanted that [expression] to be one number before continuing, instead of an ugly block [like x1 – x2]. Then it’s hard to finish the thinking process because they have to hold [the expression] in their mind.",22,Mathematical Explorations: Find the Distance: No Formula Necessary
23,Mathematical Explorations: Find the Distance: No Formula Necessary,"Nonetheless, Smith felt that students learned the material well and that they deepened their understanding of the Pythagorean theorem and how to use the theorem in a coordinate  setting. Moreover, it takes repeated exposure before students can hold expressions like x1 – x2 in their minds. The activity provided Smith’s students with such an experience, even if they could not do it yet.",23,Mathematical Explorations: Find the Distance: No Formula Necessary
24,Mathematical Explorations: Find the Distance: No Formula Necessary,"The following week, Smith’s students took a quiz. One question asked them to find the distance between (4, 5) and (-1, 7). No formula was provided. Aside from minor calculation errors, all students found the distance correctly. As Smith noted, “They weren’t blindly substituting values into the distance formula. Instead, they were using the idea behind the formula.” They calculated the length of the horizontal leg by finding the difference of the x-coordinates; found the vertical leg using the y-coordinates; and applied the Pythagorean theorem to find the hypotenuse length, or the distance between the two initial points.",24,Mathematical Explorations: Find the Distance: No Formula Necessary
25,Mathematical Explorations: Find the Distance: No Formula Necessary,"Figure 4 shows sample student  solutions. Talking with students after the quiz, Smith learned that although most of them did not sketch it out, the connection to geometry was clear in their minds. She said, “Instead of plotting [the auxiliary] point C, they imagined in their heads the height and base of the right triangle. They knew that to find the height, they subtract the y-coordinates. This tells them how much the y moves. And similarly for the base with the x-coordinates.”",25,Mathematical Explorations: Find the Distance: No Formula Necessary
26,Mathematical Explorations: Find the Distance: No Formula Necessary,"From the quiz results, Smith knew that her students learned the content in a more meaningful way than they would have otherwise. She felt that reasoning from repeated calculations embedded in the activity allowed students to make sense of the relevant ideas on their own. Moreover, the activity allowed them to experience working with some essential algebraic processes, in particular, representing verbal descriptions symbolically and holding abstract expressions in their minds.",26,Mathematical Explorations: Find the Distance: No Formula Necessary
