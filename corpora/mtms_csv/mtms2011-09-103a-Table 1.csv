"bBecause the perception of art is a  deeply personal experience, no two people will interpret a work of art in the same way. Therefore, trying to teach the meaning of artwork is diffi cult, if not impossible. One current pedagogical approach to art appreciation focuses on teaching the students the elements of art. As students’ understanding of a work of art in- creases, they will have a better chance of responding to it. ",4,mtms2011-09-103a,,
"Exploring mathematical symmetry is one way of increasing students’ understanding of art. By asking your students to search designs and become pattern detectives, you can potentially increase their appreciation of art while reinforcing their perception of the use of math in their day-to-day lives.

"Fig. 2 The horsemen in the image are easily identified, but the valuable discussion develops when students are asked what constitutes the background.",7,mtms2011-09-103a,,
"While students are searching  for patterns, they might run across tessellations that have been found in examples of artwork since 4000 BCE (see fig. 1). The artistic power of tessellations relies on the symmetries they contain. There are ways to approach this tessellating-art topic in the classroom. In so doing, you will likely increase your students’ appreciation of the role of symmetry in art while developing their understanding of the mathematics of symmetry.",8,mtms2011-09-103a,,

"Understanding a work of art is enhanced if students recognize the symmetry used by the artist. To demonstrate this concept, we show the class a work by M. C. Escher, called Symmetry Drawing E17, and ask them what they see (see fig. 2). Students are quick to find the horsemen and the general symmetry of the piece. The best discussion occurs, however, when we ask them which horsemen comprise the background. Some of the students say the white horsemen, some say the brown horsemen. Eventually, however, most of  the students are able to see each of the horsemen flashing back and forth between background and foreground. This simple discussion of the concept of background and foreground has helped students appreciate the use of symmetry as an artistic tool. We then discuss the types of symmetries that a two-dimensional object can possess.",10,mtms2011-09-103a,,
Varieties of Symmetry,11,mtms2011-09-103a,,
The symmetries of an object consist of all the geometric transformations that can be performed without changing an object’s appearance or altering its location on a plane. The four types of geometric transformations are— ·  rotational transformation; ·  mirror or reflection transformations; ·  translational transformations; and ·  glide reflections. ,12,mtms2011-09-103a,,
"A figure possesses rotational symmetry if it can be rotated around a specified point and appear exactly the same after the rotation. A figure possesses mirror symmetry if, after being divided by a line, the images on both sides of the line mirror each other. A line that divides the figure in this manner is called a line of symmetry. We show our students the image in ",13,mtms2011-09-103a,,

"We present this picture because the  number of rotational symmetries is equivalent to the number of mirrored symmetries. We then ask student to experiment with their own designs to see if the numbers in the two symmetry groups are always equal. By drawing and analyzing the symmetries of various designs, students discover that objects that have mirrored symmetry also have rotational symmetry, but objects that have rotational symmetry do not necessarily have mirrored symmetry. We then discuss which symmetries make the objects more artistic. Although some answers change from year to year, students tend to agree that an object with some form of symmetry is more artistic than one with no symmetry. ",16,mtms2011-09-103a,,

(a) Rotation (b) Refl ection and translation,18,mtms2011-09-103a,,
We tell our students that a fi gure has translational symmetry if it can be translated without altering its appearance. This symmetry only applies to a fi gure that extends indefi nitely in both directions. A fi gure has glide reﬂ ection symmetry if it remains unchanged after being simultaneously translated and refl ected across a line parallel to the line of translation. We show our students the image in fi gure 3b and ask them to determine the translational symmetries and glide refl ection symmetries of the design.,19,mtms2011-09-103a,,
Finding MoRe than the design,20,mtms2011-09-103a,,
"To demonstrate the artistry of symmetry, we ask our students to become pattern detectives and to fi nd uses of symmetry outside of class. Further, we ask them to determine what style of art the symmetry was used in. This question elicits answers that are nothing less than amazing. The students fi nd symmetries in architecture, fashion, folk art, world art, and high art, to name a few. We then have enthusiastic discussions about what kind of  art the pattern is exhibiting, how the symmetry affects the artistry of the picture, and if the design is even art at all. Corporate logos are a great source of examples. Some are symmetrical, such as the Mercedes-Benz® logo, and others are highly asymmetrical, such as the Nike Swoosh®.",21,mtms2011-09-103a,,

The fi rst step to understanding the use of symmetry in art is to identify actual examples of symmetry. The next step is to understand how an artist uses symmetry to create a piece of art.  cReating sYMMetRY,23,mtms2011-09-103a,,
"When exploring art and symmetry, it is important to understand the concept of a fundamental region. The fundamental region of a tessellation is the smallest area that can be used to generate the entire fi gure using successive geometric transformations. We have had success teaching the concept of the fundamental region by using fi gure 4a. Students see that this simple rectangular fundamental region has been rotated three times to create the complete design.",24,mtms2011-09-103a,,

"The geometric transformation  of rotation is achieved by rotating a fundamental region around a specifi c point on a plane. The new fi gure, therefore, consists of the original and its rotation. In the geometric transformation of refl ection, a mirror image of a region and any markings on the region are produced across a line of symmetry. Multiple applications of these two operations produce symmetric designs regardless of the symmetries processed by the fundamental region. ",44,mtms2011-09-103a,,
We have used both Kaleido-,45,mtms2011-09-103a,,
Mania!® and The Geometer’s Sketchpad® to demonstrate these ideas. Students are asked to design two fundamental regions and apply either rotational symmetry or mirror symmetry to create fi gures. We then evaluate the symmetry of the fi nal design. The fi gures they create using mirror symmetry possess both rotational symmetry and mirror symmetry; those they create by rotational symmetry possess rotational symmetry only. This is true regardless of the symmetries of the fundamental region. ,46,mtms2011-09-103a,,

Students are then allowed to create designs using KaleidoMania!, which is always a big hit. They can draw almost anything, and KaleidoMania! invariably creates a symmetric design that is at the very minimum interesting and often aesthetically pleasing. Figure 7 is a design created using a circular sector with a central angle of 36 degrees and multiple reflections.
