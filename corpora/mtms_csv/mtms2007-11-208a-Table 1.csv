A Look at the Development of Data Representation and Analysis in Curriculum Focal Points: A Quest  for Coherence,0,mtms2007-11-208a,,
"Jane F. Schielack  and Cathy Seeley oOne of the questions often raised  with regard to NCTM’s Curriculum Focal Points for Prekindergarten through Grade 8 Mathematics: A Quest for Coherence is, “Where are data representation and analysis?” In this month’s Focal Points feature, we take a look at an area of content—data representation and analysis—that is important enough to warrant a separate strand in Principles and Standards for School Mathematics (NCTM 2000) but that does not appear in the title of a content Focal Point until Grade 8. However, in the Appendix of Curriculum Focal Points, in comparison with ",1,mtms2007-11-208a,,

"Principles and Standards, it is clear that the content of the Data Analysis strand presented in each of the preK–2, 3–5, and 6–8 grade bands in the Standards is included in the specific grade-level descriptions in Curriculum Focal Points. Skills for data representation begin in prekindergarten and appear throughout later grades and are presented as connections to the concepts and skills involved in the Geometry and Measurement Focal Points. In Kindergarten through Grade 7, data representation and analysis in the Connections to the Focal Points sections also provide meaningful contexts as students apply their developing knowledge of number and operations. In Grade 8, the analysis of data through descriptive statistics becomes a Focal Point in itself.",5,mtms2007-11-208a,,
"data RepResentation and analysis acRoss the gRades Data Analysis is a topic within Curriculum Focal Points that takes longer than other topics to evolve from the background to the foreground across the elementary grades. Grade 8 is the first time that Data Analysis appears as a major component of a focal point. That said, it does not mean that the middle school student would have  had no experience with data. Fundamental understandings related to data are being built long before Grade 8, as students use data sets as contexts for strengthening their understanding of number, operations, measurement, and geometry.",6,mtms2007-11-208a,,
"For example, according to Principles and Standards, the development of data representation skills should begin with informal sorting experiences:",7,mtms2007-11-208a,,
"These experiences and the conversations that accompany them focus children’s attention on the attributes of objects and help develop an understanding of “things that go together,” while building a vocabulary for describing attributes and for classifying according to criteria. Young students should continue activities that focus on attributes of objects and data so that by the second grade, they can sort and classify simultaneously, using more than one attribute.

"Standards, “Investigations involving data should happen frequently during grades 3–5” (p. 177). Data is used in Grades 3–5 in Curriculum Focal Points as an important type of context for deepening understanding of other major concepts. Although Curriculum Focal Points postpones more formal work with distribution and measures of center until Grade 8 (see Table A.2., p. 34), data representations including frequency tables, bar graphs, picture graphs, line plots, and stem-and-leaf plots are discussed in the Connections to the Focal Points as important problem-solving tools in Grades 3–5 that strengthen the development of concepts related to number and operations. As number concept development in Grades 3–5 grows to include fractions, decimals, and greater whole numbers, data representations and analysis of those representations expand to include these types of numbers, as well as implementation of grade-level-appropriate operations to answer questions about the data.",12,mtms2007-11-208a,,

"As data representations and analysis concepts become increasingly more complex in the middle grades, they become important tools for communicating mathematically. As described in Principles and Standards, students should be asked to communicate about “tasks that •	 relate to important mathematical  ideas; •	 are accessible to multiple methods  of solution; •	 allow multiple representations; •	 afford students opportunities to interpret, justify, and conjecture.” (p. 271)",22,mtms2007-11-208a,,
"Tasks that are posed within the context of collecting and analyzing data sets to strengthen knowledge and skills in number, operations, measurement, and geometry have these characteristics.

"Some guiding questions for reflection and professional development include the following:  •	 How do the Focal Points in a given  year support the development of understanding and skills for data representation and analysis? •	 How can the time spent on creating data representations as mentioned in the Connections to the Focal Points be justified in relation to the Focal Points for a given year?  •	 What are some instructional techniques that can be used to support data representation and analysis as a background topic connecting to other foreground topics? •	 How can we use data situations to assess students’ understandings of the Focal Points in a given grade? ● the Technology Principleprovide insight into the role of data representation and analysis in a focused curriculum, as presented in Curriculum Focal Points. The Learning Principle states, “Students must learn mathematics with understanding, actively building new knowledge from experience and prior knowledge” (p. 20). Data sets can be used to bring experience and prior knowledge into learning experiences that are focused on number, operations, geometry, and measurement. The Technology Principle points out that “technology . . . blurs some of the artificial separations among topics in algebra, geometry, and data analysis by allowing students to use ideas from one area of mathematics to better understand another area of mathematics” (p. 26). Technology use supports the role of data representation and analysis in Curriculum Focal Points as context and motivation for learning.  oppoRtunities foR Reflection and pRofessional developMent",28,mtms2007-11-208a,,
"As mentioned in previous articles, Curriculum Focal Points is a resource that is most effective in combination with other resources, especially Principles and Standards for School Mathematics. However, with regard to data representation and analysis, it is essential that teachers also reflect on the connections within Curriculum Focal Points that allow data representation and analysis to develop in the background as emphasis is placed on number, operations, geometry, and measurement. In particular, teachers must recognize the types of questions that can be asked in relation to data that highlight the use of number and attributes to organize and describe data, the use of operations to solve problems involving data, and the conclusions that can be drawn from data to learn more about important ",29,mtms2007-11-208a,,
