"Jessica H. Hunt tTeachers are expected to possess not only the necessary  knowledge and training to support mathematical content but also the pedagogical skills to support the learning needs of all students. Coteaching can provide solutions for general educators in diverse mathematics environments through collaboration with a special educator. This teaming can have a positive effect on a general education teacher’s confi dence toward working with students with disabilities, as well as on student achievement outcomes (Fontana 2005). Special educators also benefi t from being exposed to a general education curriculum and the increased opportunity to work with content, especially at the middle school level (Mastropieri et al. 2005). Most important, these collaborative models can enrich the lesson and support the learning of all students in the classroom. ",1,mtms2010-10-154a,,
"To begin this journey toward coteaching and collaboration, general education teachers, special education teachers, and administrators must consider critical elements that are inherent in successful implementation. Table 1’s checklist can be considered when planning for and implementing coteaching. For a more comprehensive discussion, see Murawski and Dieker (2004).",2,mtms2010-10-154a,,

Many issues have been raised  by both general and special educators concerning how to successfully plan for coteaching and what its implementation might look like in a math class. This example is for both math and special education teachers regarding how to approach a topic in middle school math and adapt it to include various models of coteaching. ,15,mtms2010-10-154a,,
The models of coteaching are  framed in a lesson plan that explores classifying triangles and the sum of the interior angles of triangles. A traditional lesson plan would involve one general education teacher reviewing the content and then teaching an activity about classifying triangles by their angles and by their sides. It would finish with the teacher demonstrating how the sum of the angles in a triangle equals 180 degrees.,16,mtms2010-10-154a,,
"Several forms of coteaching could be easily implemented in a classroom using this lesson to leverage the knowledge of both the general education and special education teacher. In other words, coteaching should take on different forms, depending on the background of the teachers implementing it (Cook and Friend 1995). As noted in table 1, math educators   and special educators work together to establish the content and draw on the pedagogical strengths of each other. They then apply the model that best fits their skill sets as well as the lesson content. This discussion, taking place during collaborative planning, requires openness and trust between teachers. Table 2’s conceptual overview of the five types of coteaching, as well as planning time and content knowledge considerations, can be used for both general and special educators. ",17,mtms2010-10-154a,,
"These five coteaching examples are  discussed below:  1.  One supporting, one teaching 2.  Station teaching 3.  Alternative teaching 4.  Parallel teaching 5.  Team teaching",18,mtms2010-10-154a,,
"The models of coteaching that are illustrated more fully in this article are more common among teachers who are newer to collaboration, and they require less planning time. The last two models can be employed more fully after a substantial amount of collaboration between teachers has occurred.  one supporting,  one teaching A lead teacher and a support teacher are present during all parts of the lesson. This environment works well where a lesson can be split between curriculum teaching and administrative tasks, such as checking homework and assessing task behavior. Ideally, both the general education teacher and the special education teacher can and should assume either role. ",19,mtms2010-10-154a,,
"Consider a lesson on the classification of triangles and degree measures in a triangle. A review of previously learned material flows into the bulk of the content delivered in the lesson, which is completed with a review of the lesson. The tasks below explore how this lesson might proceed. Although the general education teacher is a content expert in math and the special education teacher is a master in supporting students with disabilities, both teachers find success in working with both the instructional and administrative tasks in the lesson.  •	 Special education teacher: Conducts  the review, instructs students on the initial task of writing what they already know about angles, with a  table 2 This overview lists the five types of coteaching and what content knowledge areas work best for each type.

"The lesson is whole class. One teacher leads the lesson, and another offers individual assistance and support. Typically, the support teacher is assisting students with instructional and behavioral needs. The role of lead and support teacher can change throughout the lesson.  Modest amounts of joint planning time are needed. Teachers divide instructional content into two segments and present the content in separate stations around the classroom. Students rotate through the stations. If they are able to work independently, a third station may be established. Planning time is conducted individually or  by the content teacher.",27,mtms2010-10-154a,,
"One teacher works with a large group while the other teacher works with a small group. Small groups can be pulled for preteaching, reteaching, enrichment, specific interest, special projects, or assessment. Moderate  planning time is necessary.",28,mtms2010-10-154a,,
"The class is divided in half. Teachers plan instruction jointly and teach the same lesson at the same time to heterogeneous groups. Teachers teach, reteach,  supplement, and instruct their own students until the  two groups are ready to rejoin later for core tasks. A moderate level of joint planning time is needed.",29,mtms2010-10-154a,,

"Table 3 summarizes the roles of  the general and special educator as the lesson is conducted. Notice that each teacher was involved in both contentrelated and administrative tasks throughout the lesson. Even though  the special education teacher in this example was not a content expert,  he or she was able to interact with  the mathematical tasks involved  during the review, the actual lesson, and the conclusion by interacting with the students alongside the general education teacher. Being involved with the review and informal assessment during observation allowed this teacher to become more familiar with the content, help identify students who needed more help, or find those who had ideas that helped drive the lesson toward large mathematical ideas. ",41,mtms2010-10-154a,,
"It is also important for the general educator to have the supporting role at various times to better interact with and understand the mathematical thinking of all students, as well as to allow the special educator to have a voice in the classroom. The planning time will be minimal if the special education teacher is involved with the class at least one period in the day and is at least partly familiar both with the big ideas that were taught in the previous day’s lesson and the goals for the current day’s exploration (Murawski and Dieker 2004).

The benefits to students are many. ,43,mtms2010-10-154a,,
"In addition to the special educator being available for individual assistance and behavior support, student progress on concepts can be monitored on a frequent basis to ensure an understanding of the lesson.

"Table 4 summarizes the equal- sharing attributes of this model. The biggest advantage of this model may be the increased student interaction with teachers, but the stations can also be used for assessment, to extend or enrich student understanding, or to provide opportunities to guard against misunderstanding. Figure 1 illustrates the station-teaching model. The first station, in blue, deals with students working with various forms of triangles. Students measure the sides and angles and learn to classify the grouping methods as outlined in the original lesson, but there is more interaction with the teacher.

"Alex: I think that the triangle is  named by the angle that appears in it the greatest number of times [for example, if the triangle has two acute angles it must be called “acute”].

Teacher: Why?,83,mtms2010-10-154a,,
"Brooke: Well, everyone around me had a triangle with two acute angles in it. Some had three acute angles. But it doesn’t make sense to call them all acute, because the third angle isn’t always acute.",84,mtms2010-10-154a,,
"Alex: Okay, wait, does that mean that we have to use that third angle to name the triangle?",85,mtms2010-10-154a,,
"Teacher: What do you mean by third  angle? . . .   The special education teacher  works with station 2 where students are examining the total amount of degrees in any triangle. In the original lesson, this scenario was demonstrated to students. With the stationcoteaching model, all students get to physically interact with the lesson.",86,mtms2010-10-154a,,
"Teacher: Take a look at the triangles in front of you. Each angle in the triangles has a different letter assigned to it. I’d like you to measure each angle in each of the four triangles. On your paper, construct a chart, and put in the values for each angle, as well as the total for the three angles in each of the four triangles.",87,mtms2010-10-154a,,
"collaborative models can enrich the lesson and support the learning of all students. instruction becomes more individualized for those needing extra support or challenge.  [Students complete the task; if students have already visited the classification station, they could use their measurements from that station to construct the chart.]",88,mtms2010-10-154a,,
"Teacher: How does the sum of the  measures of the angles in each triangle compare to each other? What do you think is true about the total value of the three angle measures in any triangle? Tear the corners off each triangle and form a straight line [angle] with them, demonstrating that the angles in a triangle do indeed add to 180 degrees. ",89,mtms2010-10-154a,,
"Station 3 is independent. That is, this station could be used to— 1.  review material previously learned  (with or without the use of technology, such as video or computerized activities) for students who have not yet visited the other stations; or  2.  apply or review (with or without  the use of technology, such as computer programs or videos online) information learned at one or both of the previously visited stations. ",90,mtms2010-10-154a,,
"Activities can be completed at this station with minimal teacher guidance. In this model, the tasks were split in such a way that students could visit the stations in any order and still receive proper instruction. In addition, both teachers need to be well versed in teaching the math content, since they are working with students as the sole teacher. ",91,mtms2010-10-154a,,
The placement of both teachers at the stations and the student groupings can be given consideration if behavior is an issue. Arranging students in groups so that those with behavior difficulties are taught by the most expert teacher might be appropriate. ,92,mtms2010-10-154a,,
"This type of lesson is more intensive from the aspect of planning time. It could be appropriate for both teachers to come in with their own lesson for their station activity, or the two teachers might collaborate to ensure that the content flows and the connection between tasks is evident, as was necessary in this lesson. ",93,mtms2010-10-154a,,
"Students benefit greatly from this  model in that they are involved in smaller group learning. Those who need additional support with content have the benefit of increased teacher interaction. Thus, many levels of students can be supported richly in this coteaching model. Movement between stations needs to be clearly defined for students (drawings or pictures of how the students should move might help make this more clear to students), as well as acceptable noise levels during instruction. Since there are two to three different activities occurring in the same room simultaneously, it is helpful to place desks into activity tables on opposite sides of the room to establish a clear separation of activities.  alternative teaching Figure 2 shows an alternative to the coteaching model. In this model, the special education teacher (or general education teacher) conducts a smallgroup lesson with students (Cook and Friend 1995) to provide enrichment, remediation, or behavior support. The following example parallels the one supporting, one teaching model, but a pull-out group has been chosen for enrichment. These students already know the content that is about to be taught. Therefore, while the general educator presents the information to the large group, the special educator delivers a mini-discovery lesson to provide another view into the concepts of what it takes to construct a triangle.",94,mtms2010-10-154a,,
"General education teacher: [Leads the large group.] We are going to do some detective work to find some measures of the side lengths and angles of these triangles. Start off by measuring the side lengths of the triangles that you have. I’ll give you a few minutes to find those measures. Next, we’ll talk in pairs about what we are finding before we report out. . . . ",95,mtms2010-10-154a,,
Special education teacher: [Works with small group; each student receives a handful of Cuisenaire® rods and a ruler.] Use a chart to record information as you construct triangles with the varying lengths of rods. Work until you have come up with two to three examples that formed a triangle and two to three lengths that did not. What do you notice about the side lengths of the two shorter pieces against that of the longest piece that formed a triangle? What about the relationship of the shorter pieces as compared with the longest piece for those that did not?  [Many students should be able to see that a triangle is formed only when the ,96,mtms2010-10-154a,,

This is called the triangle inequality theorem.] Special education teacher: Trace your triangle creations on paper and then name them by their angles and sides. Measure two of the angles of the triangles that you formed and come up with the third using the 180 degree summation of the angles in a triangle.

"Table 5 summarizes the roles of  each teacher during the lesson. Alternative teaching takes a considerable amount of planning by both the general and the special educator to account for the additional small-group lessons that occur during large-group instruction. The general and special educator must ensure that students are properly identified as needing alternate instruction or enrichment through their IEP, observation, or ongoing assessment. ",101,mtms2010-10-154a,,
"The fact that pull-out groups  are not just students with learning disabilities or behavior disorders is crucial.

This model requires joint planning time between both teachers and a commitment to teach the content in the same way in each group. The power of this model for students comes from increased participation and more work experience. Team teaching involves both teachers in the most intense knowledge of the content and of each other. They must also have a common approach or philosophy toward teaching. Team teaching ideally allows for two teachers with equal subject-matter knowledge and teaching approaches to maximize students’ classroom experiences.

conclusion,111,mtms2010-10-154a,,

Through the application of these strategies, content is enhanced  by two teachers who work together to meet a diverse range of students’ needs. ",112,mtms2010-10-154a,,
"Through coteaching, general   educators should become more satisfied with teaching a diverse population, as well as more confident in their abilities to work with students with disabilities, given the support and partnership provided by the special educator. Special educators, in turn, become more involved with content and the general education curriculum. They are also given opportunities to use the strategies and skills that they have acquired to reach all students. ",113,mtms2010-10-154a,,
"Students benefit from the increased  small-group instruction and application of different strategies and points of view from both teachers that are involved with the lessons.
