0,Trees to Pods to Beans to Chocolate - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Have you ever thought about where chocolate comes from? It comes from trees.,,
1,Trees to Pods to Beans to Chocolate - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Making chocolate involves growing cacao trees, harvesting the pods, and fermenting the beans. After that process, the beans are roasted and ground into chocolate. Cacao farmers must calculate the size of the cacao tree farm, the age of each cacao tree, and the number of pods produced by the trees to ensure that enough beans are produced each year.",,
2,Trees to Pods to Beans to Chocolate - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Roberto and his family own a 7-acre farm in Belize that contains 2,360 cacao trees. Each tree bears fruit 3 to 5 years after planting and continues producing fruit for about 30 years, producing an average of 30 pods per year. Each pod contains about 40 cacao beans, and approximately 500 cacao beans will produce 1 pound of chocolate.",,
3,Trees to Pods to Beans to Chocolate - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"1. If 2/3 of Robertoâ€™s trees are bearing fruit, about how many pods will the farm produce this year on average?",,
4,Trees to Pods to Beans to Chocolate - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,2. Approximately how many pounds of chocolate will an average tree produce in its lifetime?,,
5,Trees to Pods to Beans to Chocolate - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,3. About how many pounds of chocolate will Robertoâ€™s trees produce this year?,,
6,Trees to Pods to Beans to Chocolate - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,4. How many pounds of chocolate could be produced if a worker can harvest 1500 pods per day?,,
7,Trees to Pods to Beans to Chocolate - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,5. How many 2 pound chocolate bars could be produced with fruit from 2/3 of Robertoâ€™s trees ?,,
