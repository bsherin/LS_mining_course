Foreword by Frances Curcio, series ed. 123 pp., $26.95 paper. ISBN 9780873537247. Stock no. 14446. National Council of Teachers of Mathematics; www.nctm.org.",,
3,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (February 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","The thirty-eight tasks contained in Implementing the Common Core State Standards through Mathematical Problem Solving 35 are a treasure for teachers to add to their collection of problem-solving activities. Because of the across-grade-level perspective of the book, its usefulness is not restricted to simply teachers of third, fourth, and fifth grades. A three-part lesson format encourages teachers to consider a variety of ways to launch a task, anticipates both correct and incorrect student responses during task exploration, and includes summarizing discussions as a non-negotiable norm when it comes to a problem-solving lesson (p. 3).",,
4,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (February 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Task 2.5: Interpreting Remainders offers three meaningful examples highlighting three completely different situations when encountering remainder problems that students often misunderstand. The ideas for launching, exploring, and summarizing the task were clearly written and relevant. I appreciate the approach to contextualizing the problems as well as the quality of questions offered for conducting the discussion. The useful qualities of this task are repeated throughout the book when addressing such topics as developing understanding of multiplying and dividing fractions as well as measurement and conversion.",,
5,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (February 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics",Implementing the Common Core State Standards through Mathematical Problem Solving 35 addresses all the areas that classroom teachers are looking for and contains tasks that teachers could immediately take off the page and into the classroom. This is one of those resources that teachers will reach for again and again. They should have a well-worn book at the end of the school year.,,

12,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (February 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Generally speaking, this book tackles a nice range of mathematical topics in an approachable way. Using illustrative geometric representations coupled with accessible algebraic manipulations, the   author develops unique, sometimes playful, explanations for the topics, while holding to an understandable level of rigor.",,
13,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (February 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Throughout the explanations, the author invites readers to consider interesting perspectives about mathematical relationships, explore parallel ideas and relationships, or deepen awareness about the ideas by investigating them further. As suggested by the title, the distributive property is used to connect several seemingly unrelated notions or to provide alternative explanations for familiar concepts.",,
14,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (February 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","However, this book journeys beyond distributivity by elaborating on topics like the Pythagorean theorem from Euclids point of view to items such as isomorphisms and imaginary numbers of more recent times. Different chapters will more or less resonate with readers according to their correspondingly different levels of mathematical sophistication and prior experiences. However, the book is written to attract a broad audience and to accommodate readers who wish to pick their own pathways through the chapters.",,
15,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (February 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","To gain the intended insights from these essays, in whatever manner is chosen to sequence topics, readers will become involved in making meaning of the mathematics, working collaboratively with the author to solve problems and prove conjectures.",,
16,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (February 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics",This book is recommended for readers who want to move beyond being passive observers of mathematics to actively exploring ideas that will ultimately lead to insights into mathematical thought.,,

22,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (February 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","This book is a resource for teachers looking to integrate culturally diverse understandings of mathematics in their classrooms. As the authors discuss in their introduction, culturally responsive mathematics teaching helps students see mathematics as more than just a subject learned in school, isolated from their daily lives and home cultures.",,
23,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (February 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","The eleven chapters in the book each present an activity, object, or game specific to the culture being explored. Chapters begin by placing the featured activity in a historical or cultural context that emphasizes the connections between the mathematics as a problem-solving activity and the cultures values. For example, the chapter on Graffiti Shapes and Styles links early cave paintings or Roman soldiers carving their names in the Colosseum to a basic human desire to leave a physical reminder of ones existence in a certain time and place. Other chapters that discuss gambling and games of chance point out that these activities have been part of human cultures worldwide throughout history.",,
24,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (February 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Activities are organized by grade bands (K3, 48, 912) and are aligned with both the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics and NCTM Standards. Many of the activities are nonroutine applications of middle school work with transformational geometry and probability.",,
25,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (February 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics",The mathematics and activities in this book are not out of the box.  They require teachers to familiarize themselves with new applications of the mathematics they know and teach. Many of the lessons use applications on the Culturally Situated Design Tools (CSDT) website. Teachers will need to become familiar with the design tools and develop lesson plans that are specific to their grade level. The book would have benefited from an index of activities by standard to assist teachers who were looking to supplement their curriculum.,,
26,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (February 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Note: The book comes with a code to access the More4U website through NCTM with lesson plans, bonus activities, and links to the Culturally Situated Design Tools website.",,
