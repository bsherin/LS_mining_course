"Students in grades 6–8 need to develop an understanding of notions of chance. Teachers can promote this chance understanding by assigning probability experiments in which students make predictions and test conjectures (NCTM 2000). These experiments usually involve rolling a die, ﬂ ipping a coin, or using a spinner in which each  outcome is equally likely. The activity discussed here, however, builds on students’ sense of fairness as they explore chance using a set of nontraditional dice with some interesting properties.",3,mtms2011-09-116a,,
"Efron’s dice (Gardner 1970), a  set of four nontraditional dice, were created by Bradley Efron, a statistician at Stanford University. See the diagram in ﬁ gure 1: Four faces of die ",4,mtms2011-09-116a,,
"A have 4 pips, or dots, and two faces are blank. All six faces of die B contain 3 pips each. Four faces of die C have 2 pips each, and two faces have 6 pips each. Three faces of die D have 1 pip each, and three faces have 5 pips each. Consider, for instance, a game in which students roll die A and die B; the die producing the larger number is the winner. Die A will win when any of the four faces with 4 pips is rolled, because die B always produces a 3. Die A loses when either of its two blank faces is rolled. On average, we ",5,mtms2011-09-116a,,

The questions and discussions that follow from activity sheet 1 allow the teacher to assess and draw on students’ prior knowledge regarding— ·  experimental versus theoretical  probabilities; ·  sample space; ·  how to represent single-stage probabilities as fractions; and ·  probability notation.,30,mtms2011-09-116a,,

"With this activity, students work in pairs; one student is given die A and the other die B. Students are told that the player who rolls the higher number is the winner and are asked to decide and justify whether this is a fair game. Further, if students determine that one player has an advantage, the teacher can challenge students to quantify this advantage.",36,mtms2011-09-116a,,
"To understand students’ thinking and reasoning about the task, a teacher can facilitate a guided discussion using the following questions: ·  I noticed that many students stopped rolling die B and only rolled die A. Why?  ·  How did you determine which die had the advantage? How can you be certain?  ·  Suppose you play the game 10  times. Is it possible that die B will win more often? Is it probable? What if you played 100 times? Played 1000 times? ·  What are all the possible outcomes  of this game? ",37,mtms2011-09-116a,,
"When the class addresses the possible outcomes, it may be helpful for the teacher, or the pair of students sharing their strategy, to list the entire sample  space and discuss whether all thirty-six outcomes are possible—twenty-four occurrences in which A = 4 and B = 3, and twelve occurrences where A = 0, B = 3—or two outcomes: A = 4 or  A = 0. In our experience, students see the possibilities both ways; it is helpful if students can use a tabular format to represent all thirty-six possibilities. Before moving to compare die B and die C in question 11 of activity sheet 1, students are asked to make a prediction about which die would have an advantage. Students will often predict that die C, with a total of 20 pips, will beat die B more often, because this die has a sum of only 18 pips. Students’ intuition regarding spreading the total number of pips over the six possible sides will be helpful in extension 2 (see the sidebar on p. 118) in which students are introduced to expected value. However, for this game, the players are only interested in whether or not the number is greater; the magnitude of the difference in the two dice is not important.",38,mtms2011-09-116a,,
"Next, student pairs are given die B and die C and asked to test their conjectures. Students usually jump directly to the theoretical probability because they have already seen that rolling die B does not affect the result of the  game. Groups should compare results and strategies and justify their findings. ",39,mtms2011-09-116a,,
"After groups share their justifica- tions, the following questions may be posed to the class: ·  Some groups found P(B > C) to be 2/3, whereas others determined it to be 4/6. Which finding is correct? ·  Suppose I never gave you die C but told you the probability that die B wins is 2/3. Could you determine the probability that die C wins? How?",40,mtms2011-09-116a,,
"Introduce to students the concepts of complementary and mutually exclusive events if these topics have not been discussed. Pose the following scenarios for student experiments:  1.  Die C is rolled once. Die C rolling a 2 is one event, and die C rolling a 6 is another event.  2.  A traditional six-sided die with  the numbers 1 through 6 is rolled once. A result of 2 is one event, and a result of 6 is another event. 3.  Player 1 rolls die B, and player 2  rolls die C. Die B rolling a 3 is one event, and die C rolling a 6 is another event.  4.  Player 1 rolls die A, and player 2  extensions 1. In pairs, students could play a game in which one student selects one of the four dice to play and the other student randomly draws one of the remaining dice. Both dice are rolled, and the die that produces the higher number wins the game. If the task is unclear, the teacher may wish to simulate a few rounds in which a student selects a die and he or she blindly chooses and rolls one of the remaining dice. Groups are then challenged to determine which die would be the best choice. Given the computationally intensive nature of this extension, the teacher may wish to use larger groups or begin the extension as a class and delegate the exploration of particular dice to various groups. Groups will be instructed to organize their fi ndings using mathematical evidence to support their choice. As it turns out, die C has a slight advantage,14/27, over the other three dice.",41,mtms2011-09-116a,,
"2. The teacher may choose to alter the game so that players take the sum of multiple rolls before determining the winner. In this version, the magnitude of the difference in a single roll is important. As students are challenged to determine the best die, they are introduced to ideas of expected value. Students usually claim that die C is the best because the total number of points on this die is the largest. ",42,mtms2011-09-116a,,
"With a bit of guidance from the  teacher, students begin to develop the concept of expected value. In this situation, it makes sense to spread the total number of pips evenly over the six sides to determine the average roll for a die. Students do not generally struggle to see that, on average, die B receives 3 points because all the sides have 3 pips. However, students are sometimes uncomfortable with the fact that die D also has an expected return of 3 points, despite the fact that none of its sides have 3 pips.",43,mtms2011-09-116a,,
"3. Students may wish to explore two other sets of nontransitive dice, also created by Bradley Efron (Gardner 1970). These dice have fewer repeated numbers, which make the analysis of the dice more challenging.",44,mtms2011-09-116a,,

These events are (1) mutually exclusive, because they cannot happen simultaneously (the only options for die C are to roll a 2 or roll a 6); (2) exhaustive, because they cover all possible outcomes of the experiment;  and (3) complementary, because not getting a 2 means that a 6 was rolled. ",72,mtms2011-09-116a,,
"In experiment 2, in which a traditional die is rolled once, rolling a 2 and rolling a 6 are mutually exclusive events because they cannot happen simultaneously. They are not exhaustive, because it is possible that a different number, specifi cally 1, 3, 4, or 5, can be rolled. These two events are not complementary, because not rolling a 2 does not necessarily mean a 6 was rolled.
