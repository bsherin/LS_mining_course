"Rich & Engaging Mathematical Tasks, Grades 5-9 is a collection of mathematical activities designed to engage and enrich the learner while  helping teachers implement the activities. The text’s planning tool assists in the preparation of the lesson. It gives examples of ways to promote student involvement and success within the lesson activities. ",6,mtms2012-11-254a,,

"The organization of the book is definitely a strength. It is teacherfriendly and divided into sections that correlate to the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics. This resource is full of examples to help teachers consider the multiple ways that a problem might be solved, as seen through the eyes of a student. The examples are helpful when using the lesson-planning tool found at the beginning of the book. ",8,mtms2012-11-254a,,
"Students come to us as digital natives, so incorporating a few twentyfirst-century skills into the lessons would benefit them. Many of the realworld problems used throughout the book could easily have had technology incorporated into them. ",9,mtms2012-11-254a,,
"Whether you are an educational  veteran or a new professional, I strongly recommend this book to fellow middle school math teachers. I look forward to using the lessonplanning tool, assigning the engaging math problems, and considering the “moves” discussed in the book in my instruction this school year.  —Stephanie Affield",10,mtms2012-11-254a,,

"This book presents fraction concepts typically found in a middle-grades classroom. The concepts build on one another, beginning with the  idea of “fraction” and moving through the four basic operations, exponents, proportions, combinations of operations, and word problems. ",15,mtms2012-11-254a,,
"Each chapter opens with a teaching section. The author then gives examples and nonexamples, some of which are labeled with words that might be unfamiliar to students (e.g., “fraudulent,” on page 70). Side graphics highlight common mistakes. Textbook-style problems appear after each section, and answers are included, along with step-by-step explanations. The book also contains activities for families, several Web resources, and a mobile app.",16,mtms2012-11-254a,,
"This book is an adequate reference for learning and reviewing fractions. It lacks depth, however, and most of the content is similar to a traditional textbook. For example, the author discusses the procedures of cross-canceling, dividing fractions, and the like, but does not explain why these procedures work or how they are connected to one another. Additionally, I feel the author reinforces negative stereotypes by calling her practice problems “Brain Ticklers,” but titling the chapter containing word problems as “The Dreaded and Disliked Word Problems.”  help students apply and extend their understanding by taking slope beyond the normal rise-over-run discussion. Although this book is intended for grades 7-9, I believe it could serve as a great resource through grade 12. Students in grades 10-12 who are having conceptual diffi culty understanding algebraic ideas could benefi t from this resource, as well. The modules present activities that move beyond drill and practice to engage students in the process of learning.  —Crystal Hill Morton",17,mtms2012-11-254a,,

"This book could provide good  supplementary practice, but I do not recommend it because of a lack of conceptual explanations. I also feel that it perpetuates the belief that fractions must be learned procedurally; that word problems are diffi cult and to be avoided; and that “doing math” means solving rote, textbook-style problems.",20,mtms2012-11-254a,,

"This teacher’s guide shows how middle school teachers can use two-colored counters to encourage students to construct their own understanding of fractions, equations, and probability using reasoning that focuses on the quantity of counters and the value of each counter.",26,mtms2012-11-254a,,
"Prerequisite skills need to have  been taught. For example, one weakness is that the book refers to the use of the lowest common denominator (LCM) and a “zero pair,” but does not show how to derive the LCM or why a “zero pair” works when using manipulative representations.",27,mtms2012-11-254a,,
"The software is a dynamic replica of the book. It is an interactive representation that works well for modeling the lessons. It does not come with directions, so the teacher has to take time to learn how to use the drawing features. To use the CD for modeling in the classroom, the teacher needs access to a computer and projector.",28,mtms2012-11-254a,,
"I would recommend this book  for middle school teachers who are introducing fraction operations, equations, and probability and for use during remediation. It gives a conceptual understanding to those who are already adept at manipulating these algorithms. It can also be used as a professional development tool.",29,mtms2012-11-254a,,

"In today’s global and technological society, the need for mathematical understanding has never been greater. Algebra 1, often referred to as a gatekeeper course, is the cornerstone of advanced mathematics courses and is required for high school graduation in many states. Unfortunately, many students leave their formal study of algebra without a conceptual understanding of algebraic ideas.

"Each module can support response  to intervention (RtI) for students as well as challenge students through enrichment activities. The modules are sectioned into the following three categories: Expressions, Equations, and Functions. This resource will be useful for teachers for many reasons, but the aspect I wish to highlight is the In the Classroom section of each module. This section provides instructional strategies and specifi c activities and also contains the necessary reproducible materials.
