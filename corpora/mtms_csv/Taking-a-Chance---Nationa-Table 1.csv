0,Taking a Chance - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Your school is having a fund-raiser. Your class contributes by manning a game-of-chance booth. Since it is a fund-raiser, you want to design a game in which the player has a 1 in 3 chance of winning. Your plan is to use up to 20 color tiles (10 green and 10 orange) and have players draw 2 tiles from the bag. To win, the player must draw 2 orange tiles.",,
1,Taking a Chance - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,1. Decide how many of each color tile should be put in the bag.,,
2,Taking a Chance - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,2. Explain how you decided how many tiles of each color to use.,,

4,Taking a Chance - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Students could attempt to solve the Taking a Chance problem either experimentally, by using tiles, or theoretically. An experimental approach helps students understand the different outcomes when drawing two tiles out of a bag. This approach also helps students develop an intuition to the probability of each outcome, given the number of orange and green tiles. The results of an experiment will not always match the theoretical probability, so students who initially employ this approach will have to use a theoretical argument to justify the number of orange and green tiles that results in a probability of drawing two orange tiles equal to one-third.",,
5,Taking a Chance - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"After working on this task, a reader inquired as to whether the tile drawn first was put back into the bag. The situation of drawing two tiles at the same time is the same as drawing one tile, not replacing it, and then drawing a second tile.",,
6,Taking a Chance - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"None of the students whose work is discussed below solved the problem experimentally. To calculate the combined probabilities, the students made an initial guess about the number of orange and green tiles in the bag. Then they multiplied the probability of getting an orange on the first draw by the probability of getting an orange on the second draw.",,
7,Taking a Chance - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,The theoretical probability of drawing an orange tile on the first draw can be calculated by,,

9,Taking a Chance - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,The theoretical probability of also drawing an orange tile on the second draw can be calculated by,,
10,Taking a Chance - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
11,Taking a Chance - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Since an orange tile was removed from the bag on the first draw, the number of orange tiles in the bag will be one fewer when drawing for the second time. Consequently, the total number of tiles in the bag will also be one fewer on the second draw. Students might theorize that the number of orange tiles will need to be larger than the number of green tiles to draw two orange tiles for a win.",,
12,Taking a Chance - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Many of the younger students chose to use a guess-and-check strategy, and most were able to find a correct solution of 3 tiles in the bag, 2 orange and 1 green, using this method. Maddie, an eighth-grade student in Kate Carls Puzzles, Patterns, and Predictions math elective class, justified her answer in figure 1a.",,
13,Taking a Chance - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
14,Taking a Chance - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Daniel, a student in Karen Dornemans class, appeared to understand that the probabilities on the first draw and second draw involved consecutive numbers. He made the computations shown in figure 1b. He then provided this explanation:",,
15,Taking a Chance - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I think there are 6 orange cubes and 4 green cubes in the bag. I used guess and test to find the answer. I started with 9/10  8/9 and made my way down until I got 6/10  5/9, which equals 1/3. You would start with 6 orange cubes and 4 green cubes and it was dependent, so it would change to 5 orange cubes and 4 green cubes.",,
16,Taking a Chance - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"His guess-and-check strategy restricted the total number of cubes, or tiles, to 10, and he systematically checked the combined probability by reducing the number of orange cubes from 9 down to 6.",,
17,Taking a Chance - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Both Maddie and Daniel found correct solutions to the problem, but neither tried to find out if other solutions were possible. They also did not try to find all tile combinations that might work. Cameron, a seventh-grade student in Carls class, did try to find all possible tile combinations (see his explanation in fig. 2).",,
18,Taking a Chance - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
19,Taking a Chance - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Cameron systematically listed all possible solutions to the problem; Daniels list contained only the first solution of 10 tiles in a bag. Cameron also began to develop extensions to the original problem and reflected on patterns that he noticed. The reasoning displayed by all three students showed how one problem could challenge and engage a range of students in the same classroom.,,
20,Taking a Chance - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,REFLECTION ON THE TASK,,
21,Taking a Chance - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In reflecting on this task and the student work submitted, we believe it would be beneficial for students to initially explore the problem experimentally using tiles in a bag. This method would allow students to think about the total number of outcomes and how drawing two tiles without replacement influences the distribution of outcomes. It would also help them to think about how the number of orange tiles would change from the first draw to the second draw. Having manipulatives available for students and asking them to simulate the task would also help. We also encourage small-group discussions and whole-class discussions to brainstorm possible solution strategies.",,
22,Taking a Chance - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Kate Carl, STEM Academy, Sandwich, Massachusetts; Karen Dorneman, St. Katharine Drexel Regional Catholic School, Holland, Pennsylvania; and Andrea Kowalchik Dwenger, Wilmette Junior High, Wilmette, Illinois, submitted student work for this months Solve It Student Thinking article. We appreciate their willingness to try these problems with their students and to submit student work samples for us to share with MTMS readers. It is through this sharing of ideas that we can all learn about mathematics and how students think about mathematics problems. We welcome submissions of complete student solutions; even partial work on problems is helpful.",,
