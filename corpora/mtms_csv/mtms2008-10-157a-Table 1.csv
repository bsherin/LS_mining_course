"According to a September 2006 report by Forbes magazine, the combined wealth of America’s 400 richest people is $1.25 trillion. According to the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, a dollar bill is 2.61 inches wide and 6.14 inches long. It is also 0.0043 inches thick.",2,mtms2008-10-157a,,
"Suppose that you were given 1.25 trillion one dollar bills. Will all the dollar bills fit into your classroom? If not, how many will fit? Explain how you found your answer.",3,mtms2008-10-157a,,
"Most students focused on the volume of the dollar bill when determining the amount of money that could fit into a classroom. Antoine, a student in Mary Kolessar’s mathematics class at Wyoming Seminary Lower School, in Forty Fort, Pennsylvania, first found the volume of the classroom. He then found the volume of one dollar bill and used that value to find the volume of 1.25 trillion one-dollar bills. By comparing the volume of 1.25 trillion onedollar bills with the volume of the classroom, Antoine concluded that ",4,mtms2008-10-157a,,

"The Trillion  Dollar Classroom peared in the August 2007 issue of this journal: 1.25 trillion one-dollar bills would not fit. He went further by dividing the volume of the classroom by the volume of one dollar bill to determine that the classroom could hold $139,149,899 in one-dollar-bill increments (see fig. 1). Sasha, another student of Kolessar’s, determined how many bills could fit in a different way. After finding the volume of the classroom, she found the volume of a dollar bill. She divided the volume of the room by the volume of a dollar bill to see how many dollar bills would fit, which is far fewer than 1.25 trillion (see fig. 2).",6,mtms2008-10-157a,,
"Lizzy, also a student in Kolessar’s class, focused on the dimensions of the dollar to see how much money could fit into the classroom (see  fig. 3). She divided the width of the classroom by the width of a dollar bill to determine that she could lay 80 dollar bills along its width. She divided the length of the classroom by the length of a dollar bill to find that 60 dollars could be placed end to end along its length. From these calculations, she found that 4800 dollar bills could fit in a single layer in the room. By dividing the height of the room by the thickness of the dollar bill, Lizzy found that 28,604 layers of bills could be stacked in the room, ",7,mtms2008-10-157a,,

"Here is how I solved the problem. First I calculated the volume of the classroom in cubic inches. I multiplied the length, width and height measured in inches. The volume of the room is 9,588,711 cubic inches. Secondly, I calculated the volume of a 1 dollar bill by multiplying the length, width and thickness, all measured inches. The volume of a one dollar bill is 0.06890922 cubic inches. I then multiplied the volume of a 1 dollar bill by 1.25 trillion. The answer was 86,136,525,000 cubic inches. This is much larger than the volume of the room. The bills could not fit.",10,mtms2008-10-157a,,
"I now calculated the number of bills that could fit in the room. First I estimated the number by rounding the volume of a bill to the nearest thousandth of an inch and divided that into the volume of the room. The exact number of bills that would fit into the classroom, if the bills are packed very tightly with no air between them, is $139,149,899. This is much less than 1.25 trillion..",11,mtms2008-10-157a,,

"I started to solve this question by measuring the length which was 373 inches, the width which was 209 inches, and the height which was 123 inches of our classroom. Then I multiplied these answers together and got 9,588,711 in.3 as the total volume. Then I found out how much volume a dollar bill takes up by multiplying the length which was 6.14 inches, the width which was 2.16 inches, and height which was 0.0043 inches together and getting the answer of 0.06890922 in.3. After I have done this I moved the decimal points and divided 958,871,100,000,000 by 6,890,922 and got the answer of 139,149,899 as the number of dollar bills that would fit in our class room. As my final step I compared my answer to one trillion dollars and realized that it is smaller than a trillion. So as an answer to the question I can promptly say that a trillion dollars can not fit into our classroom.",13,mtms2008-10-157a,,
"Fig. 4 Daniel’s solution totaling $137,299,200. By laying the dollar bills in a row, Lizzy found that the room would not be completely covered in money and that some bills would have to be cut or folded to completely fill the room.",14,mtms2008-10-157a,,
"Daniel, a student in José Francisco Sala García’s mathematics class at the Instituto de Educación Secundaria Sa Colomina in Ibiza, Spain, had to contend with an additional consideration when solving this particular problem. In Spanish, un trillíon means 1 × 1018, rather than 1 × 1012, as it does in English. The manner in which he solved the problem allowed Daniel  to ignore which form of trillion was being referred to in the problem (see fig. 4). He converted the measurements of the dollar into centimeters, then found the volume of the dollar bill in cubic centimeters (1.1292197 cm3). He multiplied 1.25 trillion dollars by the rate of 1.1292197 cm3 per dollar to find 1.411624625 trillion cm3, the volume of the money regardless of which form of trillion is used. The volume of the classroom is 162,000,000 cm3; it is too small to hold 1.25 trillion dollars.",15,mtms2008-10-157a,,
"One goal of the task was to help  students acquire a sense of large numbers. As one of Mary Kolessar’s students wrote, “I thought that [the number of dollars the classroom could hold] would come up to at least a trillion, but we can’t even fit a billion! A trillion really seems like a much bigger number now.” Students  can look at what denomination of money would allow 1.25 trillion dollars to fit in their classroom. Would five-dollar bills work? Would onehundred-dollar bills work? If a specific classroom were not big enough, students could also determine (1) whether the school would be large enough or (2) what size building would be needed to hold 1.25 trillion one-dollar bills. Tasks such as these can help students get a sense of the size of a trillion. ",16,mtms2008-10-157a,,
