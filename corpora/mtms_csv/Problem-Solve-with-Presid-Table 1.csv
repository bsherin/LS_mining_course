2,Problem Solve with Presidential Data,"Motivating middle school students to learn can be challenging. One proven method for doing so is through an integrated curriculum. Educational philosophers and curriculum theorists have long noted the benefi ts of an integrated curriculum, which recognizes that the subject areas within the curriculum are connected to one another and to the real world. Meanwhile, researchers have observed the pitfalls of the traditional nonintegrated  curriculum. For example, Beane (1997) found that for many students, the separate-subject approach offers a disconnected and incoherent assortment of facts and skills with no unity or real sense. Furthermore, Gardner (1997) posited that students need to explicitly see connections and nonconnections between domains of knowledge; otherwise, generalization and transfer will not occur.",2,Problem Solve with Presidential Data

7,Problem Solve with Presidential Data,"Association (NMSA) has argued that a school curriculum needs to be integrated to help adolescents make sense of life experience and connect school experience to their lives outside the classroom (Ward 2009). A recently documented example of this integrated curriculum style of teaching occurred in an interdisciplinary activity that connected mathematics and art from the Barnes Foundation museum in Philadelphia. In that experience, the  teachers reported that mathematics teachers were able to enthusiastically engage seventh-grade and eighthgrade students in an interdisciplinary activity focused on scaling, proportional reasoning, and measurement by recreating artwork from a famous private collection (Bush et al. 2013, p. 474). This experience combined art and mathematics into motivating lessons for middle school students. ",7,Problem Solve with Presidential Data
8,Problem Solve with Presidential Data,"Curriculum integration is often  achieved through the design of integrated thematic units or the study of a specifi c topic (Ward 2009). In this article, we sought to integrate social studies and mathematics through the development of this activity. We focused our lesson on the average age of a president at his inauguration and featured the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSM) content area of statistics and probability (CCSSI 2010).   application of common core Mathematics standards  the following Common Core Mathematics standards (CCssI 2010) were applied by the students in this lesson: •  Grade 6. SP.2: Understand that a set of data collected to answer a statistical question has a distribution which can be described by its center, spread, and overall shape. (p. 45) •  Grade 7. SP.4: Use measures of center and measures of variability for  numerical data from random samples to draw informal comparative inferences about two populations. (p. 50) •  Grade 7. SP.8: Find probabilities of compound events using organized  lists, tables, tree diagrams, and simulation. (p. 51) this lesson provided an integrated real-world perspective and tie-in to  the statistics and Probability standards in CCssM (http://www.corestandards .org/Math/Content/6/SP; http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/7/SP; and http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/8/SP) and use of these standards through this student-centered analysis of presidential data. students easily connected the learning to their previous exposure to the math content and increased their understanding of these three grades 6, 7, and 8 Statistics and Probability standards.",8,Problem Solve with Presidential Data
9,Problem Solve with Presidential Data,"The integrated lesson was taught to  fi ve eighth-grade U.S. history classes during a fall semester unit on the presidency. In classes ranging from 20 to 28, students were led through a series of learning events about U.S. presidents, their ages, and their average age at inauguration. This lesson was well at inauguration. This lesson was well  received by students. An observing administrator commented on the lesson’s high quality and asked the history teacher (the second author) to share the approach and experience at the next faculty meeting. The evaluating administrator noticed the level of excitement in the classroom as the lesson unfolded, and one administrator commended the second author on her collaborative efforts and for making important connections between content areas.

13,Problem Solve with Presidential Data,It is also suggested that teachers  review the Constitutional requirements and duties for a president.

47,Problem Solve with Presidential Data,"After roles were assigned, students were asked to guess how many presidents had served so far in the history of the United States. Next, students were asked to guess the average age of a president after inauguration.

Student guesses for number of presidents ranged from 20 to 100; guesses  for presidential ages ranged from 30 to 80. ",47,Problem Solve with Presidential Data
48,Problem Solve with Presidential Data,"Next, each class viewed a short video on YouTube™ titled “44 Presidents Rap	Song:	Teach	the	US	Presidents	 in Order.” After watching the video, the groups’ guesses were discussed and compared with the actual number of presidents.

After a discussion, the class decided that the range of tens on the graph would represent from 40 to 70 years.

54,Problem Solve with Presidential Data,Students were in charge of creating the “leaves” to represent their assigned presidents on the stem-and-leaf plot. ,54,Problem Solve with Presidential Data
55,Problem Solve with Presidential Data,"The scribe in each group recorded the units and the name of the president in small print on sticky notes below the number. Students placed the actual age of the president in the lower right-hand corner. For example, two represented the units digit for John	Adams’s	age	of	62	at	inauguration. Students wrote the name of the president on the sticky note along with the units in the presidential age. When implementing the lesson at other times, the teacher found that writing the actual age in the corner of the sticky note helped when data were misplaced or when the sticky note fell off the graph. In addition, placing identical leaves horizontally rather than vertically was found to provide a better mathematical picture of the data collected. ",55,Problem Solve with Presidential Data
56,Problem Solve with Presidential Data,"Next, the runner took the sticky notes to the board to place on the stem-and-leaf plot. The teacher found it was best if the runner carried no more than two sticky notes at a time to add to the graph. A quality control helper was stationed at the board to assure proper placement of sticky notes by providing hints for the runners with the sticky notes. Sticky notes with the data often had to be moved around by the runners to ensure proper placement on the chart.  the class constructed this stem-and-leaf plot using the ages of the presidents at their inauguration.  the measures of central tendency were recorded on the board next to the stem-and-leaf plot.",56,Problem Solve with Presidential Data

Students found that the mode was the easiest measure of central tendency to find, so they identified it first and then recorded it. Because the median was the sticky note located in the middle of the data, the students then decided to physically count sticky notes to find the median point. This proved to be a fun activity as two students counted off to the middle of the data collected, met in the middle, and discovered the median. This number was then recorded beside the mode.
