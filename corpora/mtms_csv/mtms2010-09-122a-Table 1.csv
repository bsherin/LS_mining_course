It is suggested that this book be used in conjunction with a study group so that teachers can collaborate, examine student work, and plan accordingly. ",7,mtms2010-09-122a,,
"Grade 6 Focal Points, multiplication and division of fractions and decimals, ratio and rate, and expressions and equations are explored in detail in light of the instructional progression and early foundations of student learning. Both instructional progression and examining early foundations are keys to closing gaps in student learning, because teachers must look at related ideas taught before grade 6 and how students will use those concepts in later grades. ",8,mtms2010-09-122a,,
"Multiple representations are also  emphasized throughout the text. Excellent problem-solving examples are included in which students use mathematical drawings and written and spoken mathematical discourse to make connections. The classroom discussions demonstrating student and teacher dialogue model conceptual vocabulary, questioning techniques,  use of manipulatives, and multiple representations. ",9,mtms2010-09-122a,,

"Circumference and Area of Circles provides a series of five investigations in which students explore the relationship of the diameter to the circumference of a circle and that of the radius squared to the area of a circle. The target audience is grades 5−7. The book includes lesson plans for the teacher and a CD. The CD includes background knowledge, comics in two different viewing formats, video clips, and supporting blackline masters for each lesson.",12,mtms2010-09-122a,,
"Teachers will appreciate the  ease of using the materials and the well-planned activities. The lessons build from hands-on work to graphical or pictorial representations to an abstract formula with generalizations about that formula. The context of each comic provides an entry point to discuss vocabulary, ask higherlevel questions, and address common misconceptions. The video clips included on the CD provide reallife examples to help students make connections. Problem solving threads throughout the book. An assessment is also included. Sixth-grade students were engaged as they used paper-clip chains to make connections between the circumference and the diameter of a circle. It was refreshing to work with simple materials and provide meaningful ways for students to discover area formulas. When students understood the meaning of the formulas, they could then apply them to situations successfully. ",13,mtms2010-09-122a,,
"This excellent resource is a great value for the price. It will enhance your middle school geometry units and Pi Day celebrations.  —Kay Bennett, Williamsburg-James City County Public Schools, Williamsburg, VA 23187 how Many licks? or how to  estimate damn near anything",14,mtms2010-09-122a,,

How Many Licks? begins by briefly describing the merits of estimating followed by a concise overview of Enrico Fermi’s approach to approximation. The  remainder of the book contains seventy examples of Fermi approximation in action. Appendixes also contain information that will help readers estimate the answers to a variety of questions. ,16,mtms2010-09-122a,,
The first question is one of Fermi’s classics: “How many piano tuners are in Chicago?” that is followed by a wide variety of other puzzlers. My favorite is this: “Which is greater: the number of cheeseburger calories consumed by McDonald’s customers each year or the number of calories in a nuclear bomb?” Each puzzler follows this format and contains this information:  1. A background story 2. Ask yourself this 3. Helpful hints 4. Construct a formula 5. Messy math 6. Answers ,17,mtms2010-09-122a,,
"Although secondary students  might find several of the questions engaging, teachers need to be aware that some puzzlers might be considered inappropriate. In addition, there are times when the “messy math” refers to this situation: (1.0 × 1013 cells) × (1.0 m/1 cell) = 1.0 × 1013 m. The idea that this math is messy is a potentially damaging message to middle school math students. A secondary teacher looking for creative problems for students will find some in this book. Furthermore, the overview of Fermi approximation could be useful for someone unfamiliar with this approach. ",18,mtms2010-09-122a,,

"I took a pleasant reading journey when I reviewed Painless Geometry. As a math educator who prepares teachers, I had heard many comments on the  learning experiences of geometry in middle and high schools. Many prospective elementary school and middle school teachers of mathematics developed geometry anxiety or geometry phobia during their own K−12 school experiences. This book, as the title reveals, will help many middle school and high school students understand basic geometry in a better way. ",24,mtms2010-09-122a,,
"For example, in chapter 7, which  is titled “Circles,” students are guided to investigate the relationship between the diameter and the circumference of a circle through measuring real things in life and identifying the ratio. Students will understand that pi is a ratio between the circumference and the diameter of any circle. They do not need to rely on rote memorization of pi; instead, they need only discover it through experiments. ",25,mtms2010-09-122a,,
"One of the strengths of this book is that it engages students in learning geometry by providing multiple representations, including pictures, symbols, written words, and manipulating concrete items in life. In this way, geometry is not abstract any more. Another benefit is that it empowers students by cautioning them about possible mistakes they may make and teaching them study strategies. ",26,mtms2010-09-122a,,
"However, I feel the book could  have been more valuable if it invited students to explore relationships among two-dimensional shapes, through such items as tangrams, and  discussed more about three-dimensional shapes. A small inaccurate drawing was found on p. 196, under tangent-chord angle. The tangent went inside the circle. ",27,mtms2010-09-122a,,
"I would recommend this book to those students who may find themselves struggling with learning  geometry. I would also recommend it for those who may want to experience learning geometry in a different way.  —Xue Han, Dominican University, River Forest, IL 60305 ",28,mtms2010-09-122a,,

"The content of this book includes the algebra concepts taught in U.S. classrooms (i.e., algebra 1 and 2) and in college algebra. It is meant to give students an alternative for learning algebra through a nontraditional format. It targets students who struggle with algebra concepts.",31,mtms2010-09-122a,,
"The book unfolds through a  story set in the make-believe land of Camorra. As the characters discover applications and learn algebra, so do the readers who are following the adventure. The story line is engaging and will draw students into the algebra concepts. The explanations include multiple graphical, tabular, and symbolic representations. Suggested technological tools, such as graphing calculators and spreadsheets, can be used with the material. However, students will need guidance when using and applying these tools to the material. ",32,mtms2010-09-122a,,
Various strengths are evident. ,33,mtms2010-09-122a,,
"The story lines for each algebra topic stand alone, which allows students and teachers alike to use the book as a resource. Some solutions are included. The book also includes multiple representations of algebraic concepts. Some weaknesses are also found. There is a lack of material geared toward student exploration for developing conceptual understanding of algebra concepts and a lack of implicit incorporation of technology into the content. ",34,mtms2010-09-122a,,
"However, I do recommend this book as a resource for teachers in the classroom and for self-motivated adults who are seeking success in learning algebra.  —Colleen Eddy, University of North Texas, Denton, TX 76203 how Math can save Your life (and Make You Rich, help You Find the one, and avert catastrophes)",35,mtms2010-09-122a,,

"This book promises that “sixth-grade arithmetic will take you an awfully long way if you just use it right, and you can go further with only a few extra tools that are easy to pick up” (p. 3). These “extra tools” include expected value, 2 × 2 game theory, and symbolic logic. Throughout the book, arithmetic is used to address some of life’s challenges. Many of the challenges relate to health, money, sports, and relationships.",37,mtms2010-09-122a,,
The book’s strength is its use of realworld examples to make abstract ideas concrete. Stories taken from recent  headlines provide a context for looking at how math might apply to various topics. Chapter notes and a detailed index are provided for readers who are interested in finding specific examples.,38,mtms2010-09-122a,,
"Unfortunately, the breadth of  examples provided contributes to the major weakness of the book. Many topics are given only cursory attention when more details would substantiate the argument that arithmetic is useful when making decisions. Instead, the book often relies on anecdotal evidence or personal opinion to make the point.",39,mtms2010-09-122a,,
"The book is inappropriate for secondary students because of a chapter on gambling and sex. Young adults, especially those who might teach mathematics, are probably the target audience. However, unless the reader is mathematically adept, a few points could result in significant misconceptions. And for the mathematically adept, there is little that is new. Consequently, I cannot recommend this book.",40,mtms2010-09-122a,,

"The author has created a resource book of activities for teachers who work with those who have not secured a foundation in numeracy and who have difficulties understanding number and opera- tions. She states that this book could best be used with older students, but the activities will work for any student in grades K−12.",43,mtms2010-09-122a,,
The book has several strengths. ,44,mtms2010-09-122a,,
The activities are rooted in the foundation and formation of number sense for students. The ideas begin with the very important concept of subitizing. The author explains very well how to use the activities to move beyond counting one by one. The skills that are necessary to bridge the next concept are also well explained by the author. ,45,mtms2010-09-122a,,
"Many activities will help the  instructor in teaching the concepts of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division as well as standard written algorithms. Methods explored many years ago, such as the area models for multiplication, are stretched to include other math topics (i.e., fractions, polynomials, and so on). I allowed a math intervention teacher to use this resource book, and she found it very helpful. She reported favorable results with many of the activities.",46,mtms2010-09-122a,,
Several weaknesses include the  discussion of statistics based on information in the United Kingdom. The National Numeracy Strategy is mentioned. Teachers from the United States will want to know about statistics as it pertains to American students.,47,mtms2010-09-122a,,
"The author needs to consider adding Web links to show the activities in action with students or the author explaining or demonstrating a concept. A multitude of Web sites will store this information, such as YouTube, TeacherTube, and so on. These links enhance the activities, especially with visual learners. Many teachers may not be familiar with Cuisenaire® rods, so an explanation of that product might be useful, as well. ",48,mtms2010-09-122a,,

They then give an overview of how to provide math interventions in a school or classroom.",54,mtms2010-09-122a,,
"The second half of the book is devoted to specific examples of concepts that students must master to be successful in future math courses. Strategies to improve student understanding of number sense, and proficiency with whole numbers, fractions, decimals, problem solving, and mathematical vocabulary are given.",55,mtms2010-09-122a,,
"This book provides valuable information for school administrators as they develop an RTI program in their school, for resource teachers assigned to present small-group interventions, or for the classroom teacher wanting to differentiate instruction. The teaching strategies recommended are based on research, and the topics are aligned with National Math Panel recommendations.",56,mtms2010-09-122a,,
"The value of this book is that it goes beyond a description of RTI interventions and gives detailed, specific strategies to teach the core components that struggling students  typically have not mastered. Strategies for motivating struggling students, recommendations for building proficiency, and tips for monitoring progress are also included. Frequent references to research and other sources of instruction are also given.",57,mtms2010-09-122a,,

"Teaching the  Female Brain is a book intended to help teachers recognize and serve the needs of female math and science students. As  with its companion book, Teaching the Male Brain, James explores ways in which gendered teaching and learning respond to individual learners’ needs. The author first provides an overview of the history of girls’ enrollment in math and sciences in the twentieth century. Following the steady increase in women’s participation and careers in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM), in particular since the late 1960s, James reports an alarming decline in women’s degrees in STEM since 2001. ",61,mtms2010-09-122a,,
"After exploring brain theory  regarding cognitive processing differences in males and females, she presents chapters that integrate tips  for teaching females. For example, she notes that females respond well to the use of color. Allowing girls to color code and highlight specific materials are useful instructional responses to this strength. In terms of their verbal abilities, allowing girls to solve difficult operations through writing the steps of the process or to keep math or science journals will promote better integration of understanding. James incorporates other effective tips and techniques throughout the book.",62,mtms2010-09-122a,,
"It is important to note that James  underscores several times that the techniques and strategies she presents are not intended exclusively for girls and that each gender will have members who exhibit certain characteristics that are prevalent in the other gender.

Teaching with the Tools Kids Really Use is an informative book containing descriptions of various technologies available for use in our  daily lives as well as the classroom. It describes and gives examples of how such technology is being used by students outside the classroom and how teachers can take advantage of this technology in the classroom. ,66,mtms2010-09-122a,,
"Many educators have a fear of  such technology for various reasons. They do not use a lot of these technological tools, hence, they have little or no experiences, good or bad, to rely on. Many do not know what these tools are capable of, so it would be difficult to effectively use them in the classroom. If for no other reason, educators’ knowledge of these various tools would be enhanced by reading this book. ",67,mtms2010-09-122a,,
"Each chapter is dedicated to a different type of technology and how it can be adapted to the classroom. The author does a nice job of describing the type of technology, reviewing the objections and viewpoints that people  have about it, giving strategies for the classroom, and offering practical suggestions and examples for classroom use. She also does a good job discussing how the technology will influence not only the students’ learning but also their behavior. ",68,mtms2010-09-122a,,
The book is well organized. The final section on ethics and decisionmaking is an excellent closer. ,69,mtms2010-09-122a,,
"The only negative, if it can be  called that, is the technical information, which gets a little deep and could cause the reader to skip it or not want to use it. However, one reason many educators do not use these tech tools is because they know little or nothing about them. If readers stay with the book and learn about the tools by struggling through the technical aspects, they will better understand how they can be used effectively in the classroom. ",70,mtms2010-09-122a,,

I think Teaching with the Tools ,72,mtms2010-09-122a,,
"Kids Really Use is an excellent book for all educators at any level. I am a strong believer in technology in education and strongly recommend this book. I understand that some educators will scoff at it because of their education background, much like those who still refuse to use calculators in the classroom. However, there are more progressive educators out there who would like to use more technology, but they do not have the insight or training on how to use these tools to enhance effective learning.
