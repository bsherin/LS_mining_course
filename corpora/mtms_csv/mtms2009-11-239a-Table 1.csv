"Many, if not most, students have collected or played with Hot Wheels cars. Therefore, I decided that middle-grades students could explore the mathematical concept of scale factor involving these miniature cars. This activity has been successfully used with students of all ability levels, including special education students. Since Hot Wheels cars cost about  $1 each and this activity calls for only one car per student group, this is a relatively inexpensive activity to add to your classroom. It is intended to meet the following NCTM goals, as outlined in Principles and Standards  edited by gwen Johnson, gjohnson@ coedu.usf.edu, Secondary education, university of South florida, and James dogbey, jdogbey@mail.usf.edu, Secondary education, university of South florida. this department is designed to provide activities appropriate for students in grades 5–9. the material may be reproduced by classroom teachers for use in their classes. readers who have developed successful classroom activities are encouraged to submit manuscripts in a format similar to this “Mathematics exploration.” of particular interest are activities focusing on the NCtM’s Content and Process Standards and Curriculum focal Points.

"Although Hot Wheels cars may be uncommon classroom manipulatives, I feel that the advice by Kennedy and Tipps still applies: “Children should be introduced to manipulatives informally before the materials are used in a lesson” (1991, p. 47). Therefore, I allow students to play for about five to ten minutes with the Hot Wheels cars before we shift gears into academics. This time allows them to handle the car if they have not already done so, and to be able to pay attention when we	start	talking	about	the	math.	 actiVitY PRocedURe",4,mtms2009-11-239a,,
"After the short playtime, I tell students that a Hot Wheels car has a	1:64	scale	and	then	ask	them	to	 work	together	in	groups	to	figure	out	 what that means. When one student answers, “If you put 64 small cars end to end, it will be as long as 1 real car,” I	want	to	make	sure	that	the	student	 was not trapped by the tendency to focus on only one dimension (Lamon 1993).	I	respond	by	asking	about	the	 height.	The	student	recognizes	that	 the height would have to change by the same ratio and suggested that she could	(although	impractical)	stack	64	 cars on top of one another vertically to obtain the corresponding height.",5,mtms2009-11-239a,,
"Another	student	mistakenly	thinks	 that 1 inch in the small car would equal	1	foot	in	the	life-sized	car	(and	 not because the student thought that there were 64 inches in 1 foot). Rather,	the	student	is	focusing	on	a	 dimensions (usually height or length) of	the	life-sized	car	on	the	chalkboard.	",6,mtms2009-11-239a,,
"If your students have an artistic flair, they	can	be	asked	to	draw	a	profile	of	 their	life-sized	car	on	butcher	paper.	",7,mtms2009-11-239a,,
It is important that students get a sense	of	the	size	of	their	scaled-up	car.	,8,mtms2009-11-239a,,
Students	should	also	see	other	groups’	 work	to	compare	different	representations of scaled-up cars.,9,mtms2009-11-239a,,
"Once all the representations of the  life-sized	cars	are	prepared	and	on	 display	in	the	classroom,	I	ask	students	if	their	scaled-up	cars	look	life	 sized.	Most	of	the	time,	they	do	not.	",10,mtms2009-11-239a,,
"For example, a Hot Wheels bus that is about 1 inch tall is only about 5 feet tall	when	scaled	up.	All	students	know	 that a bus in real life is taller than 5 feet. ",11,mtms2009-11-239a,,
"This discrepancy created some confusion for students, because if the Hot Wheels bus is indeed a 1:64 scale model of a real bus, then when they scale up the Hot Wheels car, it should	be	the	same	size	as	a	real	bus.	",12,mtms2009-11-239a,,
"For some students, the “red flag” was raised by the numerical calculation alone, whereas other students did not question the numerical result but got suspicious	when	they	looked	at	the	 picture they drew. To address the red flag,	some	students	reworked	their	 computation while others remeasured the car. ",13,mtms2009-11-239a,,
"After seeing that that they can- not explain the discrepancy by saying they	made	a	mistake,	they	conjecture	 that	the	manufacturer’s	scale	factor	 must be incorrect; it must be a number larger than 64. I reaffirm the claim that the scale for Hot Wheels cars is indeed 1:64. After struggling together with their classmates, students find the real answer: Many Hot Wheels cars are simply not to scale for any scale factor. For a car to be a true scale model,	there	has	to	be	a	life-sized	car	 on which the scale model is based. Most Hot Wheels cars are not modeled after a real car but are designed to  after spending time playing  with the cars, students are ready to engage in measurement and calculation activities.",14,mtms2009-11-239a,,
"convenient unit: for a real car, that unit would be feet; for a toy car, that unit would be inches. (For that matter, when students want to measure the car wheels, they tend to prefer the even smaller unit of centimeters.)",15,mtms2009-11-239a,,
Misconceptions such as this gives  the class the opportunity to clarify that a 1:64 scale means that 1 unit of measure in the Hot Wheels car corresponds to 64 units of the same measure	in	the	life-sized	car.	I	also	ask	 students if it matters whether we use centimeters instead of inches. It is important for students to understand that the units do not matter as long as they are the same for all measurements. Most students answer that they could use centimeters but would convert centimeters to inches because they are more comfortable using inches.,16,mtms2009-11-239a,,
"After observing that students  understand	a	1:64	scale,	I	ask	them	to	 measure the length, width, height, and wheelbase of their Hot Wheels car. The	wheelbase	refers	to	the	horizontal	 distance between the center of the front wheel and the center of the rear wheel on the same side of the car. ",17,mtms2009-11-239a,,
"Students	are	given	rulers	marked	in	 both inches and centimeters, but I do not tell them which units of measure to use. After students measure their cars,	I	ask	them	which	unit	of	measure	 they chose and why. ",18,mtms2009-11-239a,,
"The overarching goal of the Hot Wheels activity is for students to determine	the	life-sized,	or	“scaled	up,”	 size	of	their	group’s	Hot	Wheels	car.	I	 do not tell them how to scale up their car, but allow students to use their prior	knowledge	of	multiplicative	 relationships to find a method. Once students find a method for scaling up their	Hot	Wheels	car,	I	ask	if	there	 might be some way to estimate what the	real	size	of	their	Hot	Wheels	car	 might	be	so	that	they	can	check	their	 work.	Many	students	say	that	they	 know	how	tall	their	own	car	is	relative	 to their own height and plan to use their height as a standard for their estimation	of	the	car’s	real-life	size.",19,mtms2009-11-239a,,
"When students have measured and scaled	up	their	Hot	Wheels	car,	I	ask	 them to create some sort of representation	of	the	life-sized	car.	This	can	be	 done	by	marking	one	or	more	of	the	 fit	in	a	3-inch	box	for	retail	packaging.	",20,mtms2009-11-239a,,
You can confirm this by finding the measured	lengths	of	the	groups’	Hot	,21,mtms2009-11-239a,,
"Wheel cars. Students see that all the cars’	lengths	fall	between	2.5	and	3	 inches in length. The other dimensions of width and height are each capped at around 1 inch. When a Hot Wheels car is modeled after a real-life car, there is a possibility that the scale factor is not	precisely	1:64	because	of	the	packaging.	Students	realize	that	perhaps	a	 more correct statement about the scale is that it is approximately 1:64.",22,mtms2009-11-239a,,
Once students have scaled up their ,23,mtms2009-11-239a,,

Wheels car and scale it down using the	1:64	scale.	Most	auto	makers’	Web	 sites contain exterior measurements for a specific car under “specifications.” Teachers are advised to complete this research ahead of time to find the reallife counterparts of the particular Hot Wheels cars so that students can find what	they	need	quickly.	,25,mtms2009-11-239a,,
"Students then compare their scaled- down measurements with their Hot Wheels measurements. While also using	the	dimensions	of	the	life-sized	 car, students determine the accurate scale factor for the Hot Wheels car as if it were scaled down from a real car. Asking	students	open-ended	questions	 in this context presents opportunities for	students	to	think	about	scale	factor.",26,mtms2009-11-239a,,

"Several benefits accrue from implementing the Hot Wheels activity. I get to combine two of my passions: mathematics and Hot Wheels cars. When students see that I am passionate about collecting Hot Wheels cars, they become more interested in the activity. Moreover, they start to see that math can be applied to such everyday objects	as	toy	cars.	Finally,	sharing	 a part of my life with students helps them see that I have interests that go  beyond the classroom. ",28,mtms2009-11-239a,,
"Bringing part of  one’s	identity	into	the	 classroom is no small thing. As Palmer states: “My ability to connect with my students, and to connect them with the subject,	depends	less	on	the	 methods I use than on the degree to which	I	know	and	trust	my	selfhood— and	am	willing	to	make	it	available	and	 vulnerable in the service of learning” (1998, p. 10).",29,mtms2009-11-239a,,
"Another benefit of this activity is that it connects to several mathematical topics such as similar figures and proportional reasoning. When discussing similar figures, I refer to the Hot Wheels activity and note that similar figures	have	the	same	size	but	not	necessarily the same shape. Hot Wheels, which are modeled after real cars, such as the Chevrolet Corvette, are the	same	shape	as	a	life-sized	car.	The	 only	difference	is	the	size.	As	students	 explore similar figures, they notice that there is a scale factor between the smaller figure and the larger figure. This is the same as the 1:64 scale factor between the Hot Wheels car and the	life-sized	car.	Proportional	reasoning comes into play when students are given two similar figures in which the measure of one side is missing, and	they	are	asked	to	find	the	missing measure. To find the answer, they must set up a proportion. Some of my students use the proportion xxxxx 64 = Hot Wheels measure life-sized measure to find the dimensions of the lifesized	car.",30,mtms2009-11-239a,,
"The activity also requires that  students use their prior mathematical	knowledge	of	measurement	and	 estimation. For example, although students have learned how to measure  length and have discussed measuring with accuracy, they must do so accurately and reflect on the units used when measuring a Hot Wheels car. Another way that students use their prior	knowledge	is	to	estimate	how	 large their Hot Wheels car should be when	it	is	scaled	up.	Using	the	Hot	",31,mtms2009-11-239a,,
"Wheels activity, and referring to it later in the semester, helped to reinforce the fact that mathematics is a connected	subject.	Students	learn	that	 they must remember the math learned at the beginning of the year so that they can use it later in the year.",32,mtms2009-11-239a,,
The most important benefit of using the Hot Wheels activity is its real-life connections to math. The students I taught believed that mathematics was simply a set of drills to be completed rather than a tool to be	used	to	analyze	real-life	objects.	,33,mtms2009-11-239a,,
"Students became immediately interested in the mathematics after playing with the cars for a few minutes and often commented that they (or their sibling) had a favorite Hot Wheels car.	After	working	through	the	activity,	students	realized	that	they	could	 use mathematics to determine what the	life-sized	car	would	look	like	or	 what	a	scaled-down	car	should	look	 like.	It	helped	students	realize	that	 mathematics is a driving force that is indeed applicable to real life.  solUtions to the  actiVitY sheet 1. Student answers will vary. Some might say that 64 small cars are as big	as	1	large	car.	Help	students	think	 about all three dimensions of the car, not	just	length.",34,mtms2009-11-239a,,
"2. Answers will vary. 3. Answers will vary. 4. It is important that students understand that the unit of measurement does not matter as long as it is uniform and that some units of measure, such as inches or centimeters, are more appropriate to use because of	the	size	of	the	Hot	Wheels	Cars.	",35,mtms2009-11-239a,,
"You would not want to use miles to measure a Hot Wheels car. 5. Students should notice that most of the scaled-up dimensions will not match their own experience with real cars.	Students	need	to	realize	that	 1:64 is an approximate scale because Hot Wheels are made to fit certain packaging.	You	can	discover	this	by	 finding an average of the dimensions of the cars used in the exercise. Most Hot Wheels cars are about 3 inches  long, 1 inch tall, and 1 inch wide.",36,mtms2009-11-239a,,
