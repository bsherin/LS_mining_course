Problem-Solving Knowledge  through Their Writing,1,mtms2007-09-102a,,
"Diana F. Steele tThe Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for School Mathematics, published in 1989 by NCTM, placed an emphasis on the importance of communication for learning and doing mathematics. Writing is one way to achieve this valuable communication in the classroom. In 2000, Principles and Standards for School Mathematics emphasized writing as being an important aspect of communication: “Writing in mathematics can also help students consolidate their thinking because it requires them to reflect on their work and clarify their thoughts about the ideas developed in the lesson” (NCTM 2000, p. 61). Several studies have also shown ways ",2,mtms2007-09-102a,,

She is interested in investigating how individuals learn mathematics, how they communicate about mathematics, and how teachers use this information in their teaching.",3,mtms2007-09-102a,,
that writing can be an effective tool for improving students’ learning of mathematics (Bell and Bell 1985; Pugalee 2001; Steele 2005). Pugalee (2001) found in his work with students that writing could potentially help students increase their problemsolving ability in mathematics. ,4,mtms2007-09-102a,,
"Asking students to write provides a way for teachers to understand the depth of their knowledge. When students use only procedures and algorithms to solve problems, it is difficult for teachers to know if they have developed the knowledge they need for problem solving. It is important, however, not only to ask students to write about solving problems but also to ask students to give reasons for solving problems in particular ways, to describe what they are doing and why, and to explain why their reasoning is correct. Bruner (1986), a cognitive psychologist, maintained, “We teach a subject not to teach little living libraries on the subject, but rather to get a student to think mathematically for himself . . . to take part in the process of knowledge-getting. Knowledge is a process not a product” (p. 72). Writing is a process.",5,mtms2007-09-102a,,
"Bell and Bell (1985) stated that  writing and problem solving use the same thought processes. In fact, Pólya’s (1981) four phases for solving a problem—understanding the problem (creating a mental picture of what is given, understanding the conditions, deciding what to look for); devising a plan (recognizing a similar problem that has been previously solved, thinking about how to use the data); carrying out a plan (computing, checking to see if steps are correct, proving correctness); and looking back (checking results, thinking about another way)—are similar to the process of writing. Bell and Bell (1985) maintained that the writing process involves discovering a topic, deciding what to say about it, organizing how  to say it, writing a draft, and finally revising and rewriting—all parts of Pólya’s four phases of problem solving. ",6,mtms2007-09-102a,,
"Four typeS oF KnowleDge For probleM Solving What types of knowledge are needed for problem solving? Marshall (1995), another cognitive psychologist, suggested that four types of knowledge are needed by individuals to build connections in their learning. These types of knowledge—identification, elaboration, planning, and execution—are not hierarchical and are used at different times in the problem-solving process. Identification knowledge is pattern recognition. It contributes to the initial recognition of a situation, event, or experience and helps an individual solve a problem. When individuals identify the basic situation, they begin to use elaboration knowledge to find additional details. This knowledge helps them find specific examples in memory that can describe similar experiences (Marshall 1995). Elaboration knowledge contains both verbal and visual information and enables an individual to create a mental model about using a similar problem-solving strategy they used before. Marshall stated that when combined, identification knowledge and elaboration knowledge constitute a framework that allows the individual to form a tentative hypothesis about solving a problem and evaluating it to see if the approach to the problem is sensible. The next type that Marshall described is planning knowledge. This knowledge helps the individual decide if a plan can be used that was tried on a similar problemsolving situation; however, it does not necessarily mean that a plan will come automatically. The individual must continue to use elaboration knowledge to lay out objectives and form a plan. After forming the plan, the individual then uses execution knowledge; the individual performs a skill, such as making a table, finding a smaller problem, or following an algorithm.",7,mtms2007-09-102a,,

The students described here were seventh graders enrolled in a prealgebra mathematics class in a small midwestern middle school. The curriculum used for several years had been the students’ traditional prealgebra textbook. It contained general mathematics but also introduced students to variables, symbolic expressions, and equations. The teacher in this class, however, had been using writing in mathematics all year. Students were accustomed to being asked to explain, both verbally and in writing, why they used particular strategies and mathematical procedures.

When students wrote solutions to problems, they were assessed with a rubric that focused on three areas: (1) mathematical knowledge, (2) strategic knowledge, and (3) communication (Parke, Lane, Silver, and Magone 2003, pp. 151–52). The rubric’s highest score was Score Level 4: (1) shows understanding, (2) uses relevant outside information, and (3) gives a complete response. The lowest ratings appeared in Score Level 0: (1) shows no understanding, (2) may attempt but fails to use relevant information, and (3) communicates ineffectively. Students understood that they had to explain their problem-solving approach and justify why that approach made sense.  ",13,mtms2007-09-102a,,

We sequenced eight problems to encourage students to see relationships among algebraic situations. We did not first model how to solve the problems; instead, we gave the problems to students and asked them to solve them with any method they chose. The two geometric contexts we chose, (1) size and shape and (2) growth and change, were suggested by the Algebra Working Group (1997). Each problem’s instruction sequence lasted two or three days, and we met daily for one month. ",15,mtms2007-09-102a,,
"The teacher and I asked students  first to write individual solutions, explanations, and generalizations to problems. For each item, we asked students to solve the problem for specific cases and describe the relationships and patterns they observed. We then asked them to generalize the patterns they observed in words and symbols. We collected and read their work without giving feedback. The next day, we returned their work and asked them to meet in groups of four students to discuss their solutions. In these groups, students read their descriptions, explained their thinking and their generalizations, and displayed their symbolic expressions. They listened to others’ strategies and solutions, compared their own with those of others, and assessed whether they wanted to keep or change their approaches. As students discussed their reasoning in small groups, we observed, listened, and asked questions. In this article, I discuss students’  writing in response to two problems they solved (see Steele 2002 for the other problems).",16,mtms2007-09-102a,,

"The Toothpick problem was discussed first (see fig. 1). Cathy, a seventh-grade student, began by demonstrating her elaboration knowledge about how she solved the problem. She was able to remember specific actions she might have used to solve a similar problem. Although Cathy used elaboration knowledge, she demonstrated that she had implicitly developed a plan of drawing diagrams to search for patterns, thus also demonstrating the use of planning knowledge. She describes her thought processes in figure 2. ",18,mtms2007-09-102a,,
"Cathy continued to use elaboration  knowledge while thinking about the patterns analyzed as she executed a diagram. Making a diagram demonstrated execution knowledge. Using these two types of knowledge, Cathy identified a pattern (using identification knowledge) in the relationship between the number of vertical rows and the horizontal toothpicks. Cathy then again used execution knowledge to draw another diagram (see fig. 3) to identify patterns between the number of horizontal rows and the number of vertical toothpicks.",19,mtms2007-09-102a,,
She continued to use elaboration  knowledge to reason why the patterns in the rows of toothpicks made sense. She described in words the generalization she had identified and used execution knowledge to draw another diagram and calculate the number of toothpicks (see fig. 4). She used such elaborating words as “to figure it out.” ,20,mtms2007-09-102a,,
"Cathy then used identification knowledge to find another pattern between each of the dimensions of the grids and its respective number of toothpicks (see fig. 5). Again, she used an elaborating word as she “noticed” this pattern.",21,mtms2007-09-102a,,

After writing this generalization, she continued to use elaboration knowledge to explain why her formula made sense within the context of her diagrams. She articulated well the relationship between the number of vertical and horizontal rows and the number of toothpicks and used execution knowledge to draw another diagram to  count the total toothpicks and check her symbolic generalization.",25,mtms2007-09-102a,,
Making sense of the quantitative  relationship between the two variables in the problem was essential to making both a verbal and symbolic generalization.

How many blocks would be used to make a staircase that is 18 steps high?

"She then stated her plan (using planning knowledge) of adding up the numbers of blocks in each column of the staircase: “Now, to figure out the rest of the number of blocks in the figure I will add (16 + 15 + 14 + 13 + 12 + 11 + 10 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1) to 35.” She continued to use elaboration knowledge to again  tion, she reminded herself of the importance of the shared corner.

"Another offering that students  solved was the Staircase problem (see fig. 8). The students began by drawing diagrams of the staircase or analyzing the given diagram. For instance, Rebecca solved the problem by using execution knowledge as she drew the given diagram of the 4-step staircase. She used elaboration knowledge to analyze the diagram and explain how she executed her generalization (see fig. 9). She again used elaboration knowledge to examine the perimeter blocks on the height and base of the staircase and used identification knowledge to identify the corner block as being shared.

"Rebecca identified the recursive patterns by separately adding each column of steps to find her verbal generalization. To finalize her generalization, she used execution knowledge to solve two more specific cases.",37,mtms2007-09-102a,,
"Another student, Josh, used execution knowledge to draw a diagram of the 18-step staircase and make a calculation. As he executed the diagram, he used elaboration knowledge to form his plan (using planning knowledge) to use a formula he knew and create a symbolic generalization. He observed an overall triangular shape in his diagram and used identification knowledge to find that the number of squares would help him find the area of the triangle. (See his explanation in fig. 11.) ",38,mtms2007-09-102a,,
"Josh viewed it as a problem of finding the area of a right triangle with a base and a height. He combined all types of knowledge to find how the number of steps representing the height of various staircases could give the correct numerical answer when he applied the formula for the area of a triangle. He used such elaborating words as studied and noticed. While completing his computations, he identified a pattern and executed his symbolic generalization.",39,mtms2007-09-102a,,
"Mike solved the problem by  thinking of rectangles. He stated his plan, thus using planning knowledge, to try to find a relationship between the height of the staircase and the number of blocks used to build it. He began by using elaboration knowledge while using execution knowledge to calculate numeric patterns, but he had difficulty identifying a pattern. He then elaborated on the given diagram and identified a different way to think about the problem—the relationship between the number of blocks on the bottom and the number of blocks in the height. This identification knowledge helped him “to figure out” the  area of a rectangle. He then used execution knowledge to draw a diagram to explain the relationship that he had identified. (See fig. 12.)",40,mtms2007-09-102a,,
Mike then executed a calculation to find the number of blocks in half the rectangle he drew. He used  identification knowledge to make the connection to the 18-step staircase and executed a generalization. (See fig. 13.),41,mtms2007-09-102a,,

"Fig. 13 Mike’s generalization for the Staircase problem  and why they solved problems. Through their writing, students used all aspects of Marshall’s model of types of knowledge (1995). They usually applied execution knowledge first, then used identification knowledge to observe the patterns. Elaboration knowledge, however, appeared all along the sequence and was used most often by the students. It seemed to be the most powerful in terms of helping students solve problems and create their verbal and symbolic generalizations. Visual representations (diagrams) became compelling aspects of using elaboration knowledge and were intrinsically intertwined with using identification knowledge to find the patterns and generalizations. By using elaboration knowledge with their execution knowledge (e.g., diagrams, calculations) and identification knowledge (e.g., pattern finding), students evaluated their generalizations and created strong problem-solving strategies. ",45,mtms2007-09-102a,,
"I found, as did Marshall, that planning knowledge was often difficult to separate from the other types of knowledge. The students often did not explicitly state their plans (although some did); often I had to make assumptions about their planning knowledge because of their particular actions. Creating a plan to solve a problem is an important part of the solution process. Perhaps when writing their explanations, the plan is so implicit that students do not actually identify it, even though they provide evidence that they have a plan in mind. ",46,mtms2007-09-102a,,
"Writing gave students the opportunity to create their own detailed problem-solving knowledge by constructing it for themselves, not by having the teacher tell them the procedures. They participated in the process of “knowledge getting” (Bruner 1986, p. 72); this process helped them learn to include the important steps so that there were no gaps in their reasoning. Through this experience, students learned to communicate their knowledge by explaining and justifying their solutions. While describing the generalizable patterns of the relationships between the quantities in the problems, they made their algebraic thinking explicit. This explicitness helped them develop the knowledge needed to solve the algebraic problems. ",47,mtms2007-09-102a,,
