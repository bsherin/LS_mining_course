SOLUTIONS 1.  No. It contains 5 grams of fat.,18,mtms2010-03-424a,,
2.  a.  We need to know the total  calories and how many of the calories are from fat.,19,mtms2010-03-424a,,
  b.  The percentage of calories from  fat is 45/120 = 0.375 = 37.5%. This exceeds the maximum recommendation of 30%.,20,mtms2010-03-424a,,
"c.  The name 2% refers to the percent of the mass of milk that is composed of fat. The other components of milk are water (about 90%); carbohydrates, or sugars (about 4.8%), and protein (about 3.2%). It is important to discuss that each component of food has its own caloric density. For this reason, fat, which is 2% of the mass, can produce 37.5% of the calories, whereas water, which is 90% of the mass, produces 0% of the calories.",21,mtms2010-03-424a,,
3.  The low-fat requirement is that it must have no more than 3 grams of fat.,22,mtms2010-03-424a,,
