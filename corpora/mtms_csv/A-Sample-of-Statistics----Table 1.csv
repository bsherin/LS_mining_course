3,A Sample of Statistics - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,1. Can the survey results in the comic be used to make inferences (generalizations) beyond the population of the canoe? Explain.,,
4,A Sample of Statistics - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"2. Day Ta Middle School has  140 students in each grade, 68. The sixth graders want to raise money by selling school T-shirts. To estimate how many students in the school might buy a T-shirt, some sixth graders conducted surveys. There were 60 students in each survey.",,
5,A Sample of Statistics - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"For each survey method AD described below, explain what makes it effective or ineffective in producing a good estimate for the number of students who might buy a T-shirt.",,
6,A Sample of Statistics - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Method A: Som Brero got the names of all 420 students in the school, put them into a sombrero, and blindly pulled out 60 names. She then surveyed those people and found that 70% said that they would buy a T-shirt.",,
7,A Sample of Statistics - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Method B: Clipboard Clara polled the first 60 students she saw at school one day, most of whom were her friends and classmates. She found that 20% would buy a T-shirt.",,

9,A Sample of Statistics - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Method C: Sir Vey set up a booth at the school basketball game. Any student of Day Ta Middle School who wanted to could stop by and fill out a survey. After surveying 60 students, he found that 90% would buy a T-shirt.",,
10,A Sample of Statistics - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Method D: Sam Pull put all the names of the sixth graders in one bag, the names of the seventh graders into another bag, and the names of the eighth graders into another bag. He blindly drew names from each bag, so that he would end up with 10 boys and 10 girls from each grade. He found that 65% of those polled would buy a T-shirt.",,
11,A Sample of Statistics - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"3. If the population of Day Ta Middle School is 420 students, estimate the total number of students who would buy a T-shirt with each of methods AD, based on the survey results.",,
12,A Sample of Statistics - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,4. What do you think is a good estimate of the percentage of students in the whole school who will buy a T-shirt? Explain.,,
13,A Sample of Statistics - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,SOLUTIONS,,
14,A Sample of Statistics - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"1. No. Sample explanation: The sample size (2) is far too small to use for purposes of generalization. Also, because the only favorable vote came from the girl who was the subject of the survey, it is impossible to generalize her favorability rating beyond the population of the canoe.",,
15,A Sample of Statistics - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"2. Answers will vary. Method A is simple random sampling. Although every member of the population has an equal chance of being selected, random sampling does not guarantee representative sampling. Although this is a good method, the sample could include vastly different numbers of students at each grade level or of each gender. Method B is convenience sampling, which in this case is quite restrictive in that the majority of the respondents were sixth graders. The low favorable response might indicate that sixth graders and Claras friends (perhaps sixth-grade girls) are not likely to want to buy a T-shirt. Method C is also restrictive in that (1) only those students who attended a basketball game and (2) of that number, only those who chose to be surveyed are included. The high favorable rate might indicate that those who attend basketball games are more likely to want to buy a school T-shirt than the general population. Method D is stratified sampling in that the same number of students at each grade level is surveyed, along with the same number of each gender. This method provides a good representation of the student body at Day Ta Middle School, assuming that there are approximately the same number of boys and girls at each grade level.",,
16,A Sample of Statistics - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,3. Method A: 294 students,,
17,A Sample of Statistics - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Method B: 84 students,,
18,A Sample of Statistics - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Method C: 378 students,,
19,A Sample of Statistics - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Method D: 273 students,,
20,A Sample of Statistics - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"4. Answers will vary. Because methods A and D involved good survey techniques, a reasonable estimate for the number of Day Ta students who are likely to buy a school T-shirt might be somewhere between 65 percent and 70 percent. Some students may be tempted to find the mean of the percentages obtained by each method. However, a better strategy would be to simply omit the results obtained through poor sampling techniques.",,
21,A Sample of Statistics - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,FIELD-TEST COMMENTS,,
22,A Sample of Statistics - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"This cartoon was used with four sixth-grade math classes on the last day of the first semester. Rather than provide much instruction about this cartoon, I decided to use it as a pretest to assess prior knowledge about surveys and populations, knowing that we would be studying this topic later in the school year. The students had a good understanding of measures of central tendency but based on the responses to the cartoon questions, they had very little understanding of surveys, how to design a survey, and if the survey method was effective.",,
23,A Sample of Statistics - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Most students did not think the survey results in question 1 could be generalized beyond the population. Some stated that there was not enough data because there were only two people in the survey. Many others stated that you could not generalize because the people were off in the canoe by themselves. I decided that when I next teach the survey unit, I will build on this idea of not enough data. We focused on that issue when reviewing measures of central tendency. Students mentioned that they also frequently discussed this lack of data in science class when gathering lab data.",,
24,A Sample of Statistics - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"For question 2, the students did not know what made an effective survey. When I rephrased the question as fair and that everyone had an equal chance to participate, most were then able to evaluate the four methods and determine if they were effective. Many needed some guidance to calculate the number of people in each survey method who would buy a T-shirt.",,
25,A Sample of Statistics - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Most students said that they thought between 65 percent to 70 percent of the students in the school would purchase a T-shirt. They based these answers on survey methods A and D, which they felt were the most effective and unbiased.",,

29,A Sample of Statistics - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I assigned this cartoon to my sixth-grade class. Although the cartoon could certainly be used at any time to engage students in critical thinking, we had just completed a unit on graphing and survey techniques and students had a lot of opinions to offer.",,
30,A Sample of Statistics - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"When we studied various types of graphs, we talked about when they are best used, how to collect the data, and how to display the data accurately. This cartoon allowed me to see just how well the students were able to internalize and apply the lessons they learned. Each method generated a lot of discussion, which ultimately led the class to recognize the quality of the method. This activity took us longer to do than I anticipated because the discussions were good. It was time well spent. The scenario that was depicted, selling school T-shirts, was an idea that the students could easily relate to.",,
31,A Sample of Statistics - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,I would certainly not stop at this one brief cartoon. Students need to be presented with many more scenarios and also need to view improperly displayed graphs so that they can reach a comfort level in recognizing accurate data and results.,,

35,A Sample of Statistics - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Data, data everywhere. How is it collected? What should I do with it? What makes an effective presentation? All these questions and more kicked off the data and statistics unit with my sixth-grade prealgebra students. The Miss Peach comic was the perfect formative assessment since those students who muttered oooooh verbally demonstrated understanding that the 50 percent acceptance rate was found at the back of the canoe and not at the front!",,
36,A Sample of Statistics - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The survey methods were reviewed independently by the students and then discussed by the entire class. A consensus was reached that method D provided the most valuable information, and most applied that result to the final question asking students to estimate the percentage of students they felt would buy a T-shirt. Some felt that 60 percent was a good approximation because it was close to method Ds 65 percent, whereas others just chose the 65 percent. A few averaged all results and rounded to 61 percent; others discounted B and C as ineffective, averaged A and D, and arrived at an estimated 67 percent. Several thought that +/ 5 percent as a margin of error was a good indicator of their accuracy and chose between 60 percent and 67 percent of the students as their prediction.",,
37,A Sample of Statistics - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Calculating the number of students at Day Ta Middle School that would purchase a T-shirt was primarily solved in two ways. Students either set up a proportion based on the total population or calculated the survey respondents and multiplied that number by 7 since 60 students represented one-seventh of the population.,,
