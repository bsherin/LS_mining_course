"Using MUltiPlication to BUild coUnting nUMBeRs When we want to understand how something works in the physical world, we often look at how it is constructed from simpler pieces. If we want to know about the properties of molecules, we must understand that they are built from the elements that we see listed in the periodic table. Elements can then be analyzed by looking at their atomic structures. Similarly, when we understand that a number is built from its prime factors, we need to look at its properties and its relationship to other numbers. ",6,mtms2009-10-156a,,

"Each group writes the numbers 2  through 12 in a column on the left side of a sheet of paper. The lesson begins with the class building each of these numbers. As the activity progresses and the students discover the types of building blocks needed, each color will be assigned an appropriate number so that we can build the counting numbers. (See fig. 1.)",13,mtms2009-10-156a,,
"This article will use a question- and-answer format to mirror the content of a typical classroom discussion. For clarification, we begin by defining the counting (natural) numbers as the set of positive integers: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, . . .}. Notice that this set does not include the number 0.",14,mtms2009-10-156a,,
"How can we use multiplication to make the number 2? Students usually state that 2 can be written as 2 × 1 only, disregarding the order of the factors. On one hand, they realize that we may use as many factors of 1 as we like. On the other hand, we really do not need any of them. To keep the process simple, we will ignore the factors of 1 and use a single white block to represent the number 2. To show this, each group places a white block next to the number 2 on their paper.",15,mtms2009-10-156a,,
"How can we use multiplication to  build the number 3? Students respond that just as with the first number, 3 can be written as 3 × 1, but once again the 1 is not needed. We are not able to use our white 2 block because 2 is not  a factor of 3. We need a new color of building block for the number 3, which is red. Students place a red block next to the number 3 on their page.",16,mtms2009-10-156a,,
"Do we need a new type of building block to build 4? Students will see that although we could build 4 as 4 × 1, we may also use our known 2 blocks to express it as 2 × 2. Since we will never introduce a new type of building block unless it is needed, we attach two white 2 blocks to represent 2 × 2. Students place this pair of white blocks next to the number 4 on the page.",17,mtms2009-10-156a,,
"As groups understand the process,  they begin to work more independently. The next number is 5. Since it cannot be built using the factors of 2 or 3, the number 5 must have its own building block, which is orange. The number 6 can be written as 2 × 3. Students attach a white 2 block and a red 3 block. The number 7 requires a new block, which is yellow. Attaching three white 2 blocks as 2 × 2 × 2 represents 8. ",18,mtms2009-10-156a,,
"Students continue building the remaining counting numbers 2 through 12, as summarized in figure 2. Note that the commutative and associative properties of multiplication imply that a given collection of blocks represents a unique number, regardless of how they are ordered or grouped. ",19,mtms2009-10-156a,,
"The building blocks we have needed  so far are 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11. What do these numbers have in common? Students often first point out that most of the numbers are odd. However, they see that 2 is included although 9 is not. Someone then comments that all five numbers are prime and that a new color of block will always be needed because, by definition, prime numbers cannot be built from other factors. However, all composite numbers so far have been built from existing prime blocks. We then summarize this  very important idea: Counting numbers are built by multiplication using prime numbers as building blocks.",20,mtms2009-10-156a,,
"We have now built the counting  numbers 2 through 12. Is it possible if we keep building each counting number in order that we will come to a number that cannot be constructed? Students may note that this is impossible because whenever a number cannot be built using existing blocks, we introduce a new type of block to represent it. ",21,mtms2009-10-156a,,
"At this point in the activity, the groups continue building the counting numbers consecutively, beginning with the number 13, listing more numbers, and placing the appropriate “building” next to each number. To make the next portion of the activity run more smoothly, they also sketch each “building” as they create it. ",22,mtms2009-10-156a,,
"Although the students have been  exposed briefly to the concept of a prime factorization, most of them do not immediately make the connection with this activity. I do not give them the vocabulary or any algorithms.",23,mtms2009-10-156a,,
" Watching the strategies that the groups develop is the overriding concern at this point. I monitor the groups as they work, giving clues if they are stuck and helping them identify and correct errors. If they run out of blocks of a given color, they can disassemble some of their previous constructions and use those blocks, since they have already sketched the diagrams. ",24,mtms2009-10-156a,,
"Once most groups have found at least one successful strategy, the class shares their discoveries. Some groups use a variation of the one-block-ata-time strategy, illustrated in figure 3. Others realize that they are finding prime factorizations and building factor trees. (If so, I introduce the necessary vocabulary.) Still others write the number they are building as a product of two factors, look at their previously built numbers, and attach copies ",25,mtms2009-10-156a,,

Why do you think that prime numbers are so important? Students reply that primes are the numbers needed to build the counting numbers using multiplication.,32,mtms2009-10-156a,,
"Why do you think that 1 is not defined as a prime number? In fifth grade, students learned that a prime number has exactly two factors: 1 and itself. The fact that 1 is not defined as prime is noted simply as a mathematical convention. One goal of these activities is to help students develop a sense for why this seemingly arbitrary choice may have been made. It would be confusing to include 1 as a prime number (a building block), because we  could use as many or as few 1 blocks as we like to build any counting number. It is much simpler to simply avoid its use. If some students wonder how to build the number 1, I tell them that we will address it soon. ",33,mtms2009-10-156a,,

"Students work in their groups to create a building-block grid for the prime factorizations of all counting numbers from 2 through 100. (The number 1 is included in the grid but is left blank.) The completed grid will be used to generate a class discussion in which students observe, analyze, and describe patterns within and between prime factorizations of different numbers.",35,mtms2009-10-156a,,
"Each group receives a large, numbered 10 × 10 grid on poster board; colored pencils or markers; and a template for drawing squares. Since this activity can be time-consuming, students may refer to the sketches of the numbers they have already built. I divide the task of finding the remaining prime factorizations up to 100 among the groups, and then share their results with the class. If time is short, I may use a prepared grid and move directly into the discussion. (Fig. 4 is a completed grid through 50. )",36,mtms2009-10-156a,,
"We chose to arrange the blocks in a consistent manner for ease of reading. Repeated factors appear in horizontal rows, with smaller factors appearing below the larger factors. Now that we have completed grids for reference, further class discussion can begin.",37,mtms2009-10-156a,,
"Do you see any relationship between the size of a number and the size of its building? Students should notice that the apparent size of a block diagram has no predictable relationship to the size of the number it represents. For example, the number 60 requires four blocks to be built; 61, although larger, is prime and requires only one block. Although patterns are found in the distributions of particular colors of blocks, buildings of different sizes and  appearances seem to be distributed almost randomly throughout the grid.",38,mtms2009-10-156a,,
"Can you see a way to predict the location of the next prime number by looking at a previous prime number? (Remember that the prime numbers are those that are built with exactly one block.) Students may spend quite a bit of time looking for patterns in the distribution of the prime numbers. They often think they have made a discovery only to find a suspected pattern soon falls apart. They are often surprised to learn that, in spite of a long search, mathematicians have never found a simple way to predict the next prime. ",39,mtms2009-10-156a,,
"Certain types of patterns can be  found. For example, do you notice anything about the buildings of neighboring numbers (numbers that differ by 1) on your grid? The only color block that the buildings of neighboring numbers have in common is black. Black blocks represent any prime number larger than 19. When two neighboring numbers both contain a black block, these blocks always represent different prime factors. For example, although 46 and 47 each contain a black block, one black represents the factor 23, whereas the next black stands for 47.",40,mtms2009-10-156a,,
"Translating our observation from  block language to the language of mathematics, numbers that differ by 1 have no common factor other than 1. At first glance, this may seem quite surprising. However, it can be easily understood by looking more closely at even and odd numbers.",41,mtms2009-10-156a,,
What do the buildings of all even  numbers have in common? What about the buildings of odd numbers? The buildings of even numbers always have at least one white 2 block. Odd numbers never contain any white blocks.,42,mtms2009-10-156a,,

"Many other interesting questions  can be explored using the grid: 1.  How can we see that every multiple of 4 is also a multiple of 2? 2.  If a number is divisible by both  2 and 3, how can we see that it is also divisible by their product, 6? 3.  If a number is divisible by both 4 and 6, how can we see that it is not necessarily divisible by the product, 24?  4.  If two numbers differ by n (if they  are n squares apart on the grid), then what can we say about the possible common factors of the numbers?",46,mtms2009-10-156a,,
"After we have completed the  building-blocks activities, I often leave  a grid posted in the classroom. It can be a wonderful resource for identifying prime numbers, verifying multiplication facts, doing mental arithmetic, finding greatest common factors and least common multiples, and so on.

The next step asks students to analyze the blocks for multiplication.,49,mtms2009-10-156a,,
How can we use blocks to show the multiplication of composite numbers? Attaching individual blocks (prime numbers) means that the two numbers are being multiplied; we do  the same for composite numbers. Figure 5 illustrates 88 × 75 being  produced with building blocks. Blocks can also be rearranged to aid mental multiplication. ,50,mtms2009-10-156a,,

No Blocks,57,mtms2009-10-156a,,
"If we multiply numbers by attaching blocks, how would we divide them? Students usually suggest that blocks should be separated or detached. Avoid phrases that suggest subtraction, such as take away. Figure 6  illustrates the number sentence  60 ÷ 10 = 6. We build the number 60, detach a 5 and a 2 block, and leave a 3 and a 2 block.",58,mtms2009-10-156a,,
"Does it matter whether we detach the 2 and 5 blocks together or one at a time? Students can easily see that whether we detach the blocks one at a time, or both at once, the resulting collection of blocks is the same. In other words, division by 10 is equivalent to division by 2 followed by division by 5.",59,mtms2009-10-156a,,
"Figures 5 and 6 also show exponential notation for the block diagrams. Notice that each exponent just counts the number of blocks of a given prime factor (color). The blocks can help students naturally visualize properties of exponents. Figure 7’s block diagram represents the number sentence 2m × 2n = 2m+n. If all blocks are the same color, then the number of blocks of that color obtained by attaching the buildings is the sum of the number of blocks in each building. In mathematical language, if the bases are the same, the exponent of the product is the sum of the exponents of the factors:  am × an = am+n",60,mtms2009-10-156a,,
"Using the fact that we divide by detaching blocks, students may also be able to predict the corresponding property for division of exponential expressions: ",61,mtms2009-10-156a,,
"Since some students may be confused by the addition and subtraction in our  discussion of multiplication blocks, I make a point of saying that we are not adding or subtracting the blocks (the prime numbers themselves). Rather, we are adding or subtracting the number of blocks of each type (the exponents).",62,mtms2009-10-156a,,
"What will happen to the blocks if we start with a building showing an exponential expression, such as 33, then keep dividing by the base? Students realize that the blocks will be detached one at a time until none are left.",63,mtms2009-10-156a,,
"What number will it represent  when no blocks remain? Students’ first response is usually 0, which is contradicted by figure 8. The number 27 is 33, so we build it with 3 red blocks. Each time we divide by 3, the exponent drops by 1, going from 3 to 2 to 1 to 0. At the same time, the quotients go from 27 to 9 to 3 to 1. Apparently, the number 1 is built by using no, or zero, blocks. Since exponents count the number of blocks, this must mean that 30 = 1. ",64,mtms2009-10-156a,,
"This action is related to the fact that any number multiplied by 1 is equal to itself. As an example, carry out the procedure above in reverse. In the first step of the process, we begin with 0 red blocks and attach 1 red block, which is represented by the number sentence 1 × 3 = 3. If no blocks, or exponents of 0, were to represent the number 0, then attaching blocks to no blocks would represent multiplication by 0. The product would always be 0, regardless of the blocks that we attached.",65,mtms2009-10-156a,,
"Look more closely at the way we  categorize the counting numbers. The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic states that every natural number except 1 can be expressed uniquely as a product of prime factors, disregarding their order.

"Building blocks provide a striking way to visualize the factors of a number. Since we obtain factors by division, we form a factor of a number from its block diagram by detaching any number of blocks (including none or all of them). To be more precise, the factors in any block diagram are exactly all possible subcollections of its blocks. Each time we detach blocks, we actually create a pair of factors: the part that we detached and  the part that remains. It is helpful to remember that the “empty” collection of blocks represents the number 1. Once students have seen this example, I ask them to try a number with more factors, such as 210.

"Since we form multiples by attaching blocks to the original building, every multiple of a number will contain the original building. Thus, a common multiple of two numbers will be represented by any collection of blocks that contains both of the given block diagrams. To determine the least common multiple, locate the smallest such collection. (See fig. 12.) Removing any block from the LCM would result in a building that is no longer a multiple of both numbers. Thus, the LCM is represented as “the smallest collection of blocks that contains both block diagrams.” Figure 13 gives an overview of block representations of the GCF and LCM. The statements differ by only a few key words.",86,mtms2009-10-156a,,

"Did anyone attach the original  numbers, then eliminate extra blocks? Some groups think of attaching both original buildings, since this will ensure that both buildings are contained in the result.

All six are needed to ensure that the second number is contained in the LCM, but the additional four blocks from the first number are not necessary since they are already included. In general, for each color (prime factor), the LCM will always contain the larger of the two collections of blocks.

"We can take this idea one step  further. Using a similar line of ques- tioning, students discover that the collection of blocks that the buildings have in common (the GCF) is determined by the smaller of the two collections for each factor. Therefore, if we have block diagrams for two numbers, a and b, we may simultaneously form the GCF and the LCM. We proceed, one color at a time, by attaching the larger collection to the LCM and the smaller collection to the GCF. Since this process uses each block in the two buildings exactly once, we can see that attaching the GCF and the LCM will produce the same result as attaching the two original numbers. (See fig. 15.)
