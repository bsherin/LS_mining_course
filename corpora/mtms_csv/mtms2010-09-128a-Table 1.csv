How to Check Digits math for real,0,mtms2010-09-128a,,
"When an account or product number is typed into a computer, there is often a quick way to check that the number had been entered correctly. One way is with a check digit, which  is an extra digit at the end of the  account number, representing the ones digit of the sum of the account digits, or some other formula. ",1,mtms2010-09-128a,,
"With a Universal Product Code  (UPC), accuracy can be checked using this formula:      3 × the first digit + the second digit  + 3 × the third digit + the fourth digit  + 3 × . . . . ",2,mtms2010-09-128a,,
"For example, given the following ",3,mtms2010-09-128a,,
"UPC bar code, determine the “sum” of the digits using the pattern: (3 × 0) + 1 + (3 × 2) + 3 + (3 × 4) + 5              + (3 × 6) + 7 + (3 × 8) + 9              + (3 × 0) + 5 = 90",4,mtms2010-09-128a,,

(a) (b) 2.  What pattern do you notice about the sum from each example? How would a computer use this information to verify that a bar code was entered correctly? ,6,mtms2010-09-128a,,
"The International Standard Book Number (ISBN) system requires 10-digit numbers. The first digit is multiplied by 10, the next digit by 9, and so on. That is, each multiplier decreases by 1 until the 10th digit of the ISBN is multiplied by 1. Then the sum is taken. See the example in figure 1. ",7,mtms2010-09-128a,,

"5.  What do you notice about the sums  of the examples and your book’s ISBN number? What is the rule that the computer uses to determine if the number was input correctly? 6.

"5.  If the sum is divisible by 11, then the ISBN has been typed correctly.",17,mtms2010-09-128a,,
"6.  The UPC system would not detect the error, since the two digits that are switched are both multiplied by 3 and do not change the value of the check sum. The ISBN system, however, would detect the error.    Many extensions can be made with other checking systems, including bank routing numbers and ISBN 13 numbers. Debating why different systems exist could also be interesting.",18,mtms2010-09-128a,,
