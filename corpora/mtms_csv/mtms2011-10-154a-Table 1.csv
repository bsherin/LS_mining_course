"Geometry is found at the heart of the everyday working world. Many ideas for classroom activities can be found in popular culture, in cell phone games, in movies, and in books. Geometry is also critical in the production of visual effects found in video games, websites, and movies. ",3,mtms2011-10-154a,,
"Story plot lines also hold many possibilities for geometry lessons. NCTM (2000), the International Reading Association (IRA) (2003), and many state standards encourage and sometimes require reading across the curriculum, with an emphasis on the use and understanding of precise and relevant mathematical language. A multitude of  adult literature, to mainstream magazines—contain real-world mathematics, particularly geometry. ",4,mtms2011-10-154a,,
"Classic literature such as Sherlock Holmes can guide students through a tightly constructed short story that interweaves geometry. In “The Adventure of the Musgrave Ritual” (Doyle 1893, 2003), Holmes recounts how a former classmate, Reginald Musgrave, asks for help in understanding a secret Musgrave family ritual. Mathematics plays an important role in this story. First, mathematical terms—such as formula, measurements, ﬁ xed points, trigonometry, height, calculations, yard,  and parallel—are peppered throughout the story to illustrate the way in which Holmes solves the case. Second, mathematics is at the heart of the family ritual, which is an enactment of a treasure hunt. Holmes uses practical geometry to solve the crime discussed in the story: “If a rod of six feet threw a shadow of nine, a tree of sixty-four feet would throw one of ninety-six, and the line of the one would of course be the line of the other” (Doyle 1893, 2003, p. 471). This calculation becomes a fi xed point as Holmes draws a map of the estate to solve the case. Other classic examples include the tactile two-dimensional world  found in the classic novel Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions (Abbott 1952). Another mainstream literary example is found in the scrambled Fibonacci sequence given in The Da Vinci Code (Brown 2003). These are only a few of the examples that are available to students. ",5,mtms2011-10-154a,,
"More recent works include “Polyhedrons” (Metzger 2005), a science fi ction story published in Asimov’s Science Fiction magazine, in which two boys learn about the universe, problem solving, robotics, and Euclidian and non-Euclidian geometry. All of the Above (Pearsall 2006) brings geometry back to the classroom and into the lives of fi ve urban middle grades students who attempt to construct the world’s largest tetrahedron. Crimes and Mathdemeanors (Hathout 2007), a book of short mysteries written by Leith Hathout, a reallife teenage math genius, contains a mathematical puzzle at the heart of each solution. In “An Adventure at the Grand Canyon” (Hathout 2007, p. 27–36), Ravi, the young hero, creates a time-distance diagram to conclude that a suspect lied about the time he reached a certain location, and the case is solved.

"Storytelling can provide unique teachable moments. Mathematics content found in a good story can be seamlessly woven throughout a lesson. The technical vocabulary used in some stories occurs in a natural way, outside a textbook setting. A great story can also motivate students to actively engage in meaningful mathematics. With a wide range of materials available, from young adult novels to picture books to mainstream literature, students should be able to fi nd many options that speak to their unique interests and reading abilities.

The following three examples, each followed by a reading strategy and activity that can be implemented in a middle grades classroom, emphasize mathematical language and geometry. Crime Files (Brown 2006) is a series of short four-minute mysteries for young adults. The Wright 3 (Balliett 2006) is a young adult novel that is part of a larger series connecting math and art.

"Crime Files: Four-Minute Forensic Mysteries (Brown 2006a, 2006b) is a series of young adult stories (recommended for grades 6–9) featuring mysteries solved by a team of crime scene investigators. Cracking each case involves science, math, and plenty of deductive reasoning skills. A geometric principle that is often used in the Crime Files books is the technique of measuring angles to make deductions. In “The Defense Rests in Peace” (pp. 5–9), a crime scene  is analyzed. Mathematics is used to calculate patterns and angles, and that information is compared with other physical evidence. There are several suspects, but one eyewitness is lying. Can a mathematical calculation fi nd the liar and solve the crime? ",10,mtms2011-10-154a,,
"Coding text—using a symbol, a  sticky note, or another system—is an excellent reading strategy to encourage students to make predictions and use their knowledge of mathematics to solve cases. When students code text, they must concentrate on reading comprehension while questioning the text, making connections, presenting predictions, and more. Codes that identify passages that connect to other works, that mark confusion found in the text, or that note an unfamiliar word will help students interact with the text as well as monitor their comprehension, which is a vital reading strategy. Customizing codes for specifi c reading tasks will help students stay focused on the content being studied. ",11,mtms2011-10-154a,,
"When our students coded the text in “The Defense Rests in Peace,” we found that they preferred to read the story straight through fi rst, before coding during a second read. With that strategy in mind, we asked students to use two codes when rereading the story. First, they were to underline any details that might be important as clues to solve the mystery; second, they were to circle anything that did not make sense or was unfamiliar.",12,mtms2011-10-154a,,
"Some of the most crucial pieces of information pulled from their codes involve mathematics. Students often code information about angles and heights, intuitively knowing that these clues will help solve the case. In addition, students tend to code location of items and persons in the room to help them recreate the crime scene for the follow-up activity. After students have completed reading, give  table 1 The learning log for The Wright 3 explores the mathematics found in the text.",13,mtms2011-10-154a,,

"Blue Balliett’s series connects mathematics, art, and mystery with young adult themes. In The Wright 3 (2006), Balliet uses mathematics, architecture, and friendship to ground a mystery. In this book, Calder, Petra, and Tommy work to save Frank Lloyd Wright’s Robie House, a historical landmark, from being destroyed. In the meantime, strange clues and patterns appear around town, and it takes teamwork, Calder’s pentominoes, Petra’s analysis of a famous novel, and Tommy’s cracking a mathematical sequence to help save the historic house. ",23,mtms2011-10-154a,,
"Mathematics, particularly geometry, plays a vital role in the novel, with topics including the use of pentominoes, the Fibonacci sequence, and the golden ratio. Some mathematical vocabulary used include ratio; ver- tices; symmetry; and isosceles, scalene, and equilateral triangles. When using short readings, coding text can keep students focused and support their comprehension and self-monitoring. When using longer works, such as The Wright 3, expanding coding text into a type of learning log gives students a way to make connections between the plot lines and the mathematical terms and concepts in the book. Students are encouraged to keep track of important information (even providing quotes), add a personal response, illustrate a  passage, or ask questions.",24,mtms2011-10-154a,,
"Each log can be customized for a specific reading or purpose. For The Wright 3, we use a triple-entry table. Students log important clues in quote form in the first column, define key terms or mathematical concepts in the second column, and make mathematical predictions and inferences about the story in the third column.

"We found that leaving different columns blank helps students focus on the mathematical connections and meaning based on what they have read. In each of the examples that are provided, understanding the mathematical ideas will help readers follow the flow of the story as well as pick up important clues. The incorporation of mathematics is so seamless that leisurely readers and mathematicians alike can enjoy The Wright 3. Before students begin reading, give them a triple-entry journal table with a few sample entries filled in so that they will know what is expected. Then explain the assignment so that students can work independently as they read. Periodically, check students’ responses to see the range in their thinking and connections to mathematics.

Students are given  an excerpt to read from Artifacts (see fig. 1), then they are asked to look around the classroom to consider the path of a bullet.

A student might be located 4  tiles south of the door and 3 tiles west, for example. In other classrooms, ceiling tiles or wall bricks might be used. Students could also pace off the distances, using stride length as a unit of measurement.",45,mtms2011-10-154a,,
"After some discussion, the students are divided into teams, and the teacher places a book on the floor. Each team is given a different origin point. One team might use the center of the teacher’s desk as the origin. Another team might measure from the door. A third might measure from a spot on the floor. After completing the exercise, each team writes the book’s coordinates, which are all different, on the board. The students are asked, “You have several different answers. Is that a bad thing?” The teacher then guides the discussion toward the importance of defining the origin when mapping in the real world. The idea of “3 feet away” means nothing when the reader does not know what he is 3 feet away from.",46,mtms2011-10-154a,,
"As part of the discussion, the  teacher might ask whether it would be wise to use the book itself as the origin point, which is a tempting idea. There are no measurements involved. The book’s location is simply (0, 0). Once the class has decided whether they would like to define the book itself as the origin, the teacher shows the weakness in this strategy by simply picking up and moving the book. We have used this simple activity in classrooms ranging from developmental middle school math through algebra 2. Its resonance for students goes deeper than a simple opportunity to escape their desks and walk around.",47,mtms2011-10-154a,,
