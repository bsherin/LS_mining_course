1,The Search for Hidden Structure,"How does one look for mathematical structure? Finding structure is a challenging yet accessible activity for all students. This article describes a lesson in which seventh graders engaged with mathematical structure. The setting was a seventh-grade prealgebra classroom in a suburban school. The classroom teacher was co-author Tatyana Finkelstein. Using classroom excerpts, we illustrate three lesson design practices that shed light on the kinds of tasks teachers can pose to support students in seeking and fi nding structure: ",1,The Search for Hidden Structure

6,The Search for Hidden Structure,"Core’s eight Standards for Mathematical Practice (SMP) is to “look for and make use of structure” (CCSSI 2010, p. 8). Principles to Actions: Ensuring Mathematical Success for All similarly encourages “opportunities for delving more deeply into understanding the mathematical structure of problems and relationships among mathematical ideas, instead of simply seeking correct solutions” (NCTM 2014, p. 48). We focused on the “look for” part of SMP 7 by addressing the question of how students might look for mathematical structure. The search for structure is formally in the domain of SMP 7, but the standards are not intended to be used in isolation from one another (PARCC 2015). When relevant, we point to other SMP that come into play. ",6,The Search for Hidden Structure
7,The Search for Hidden Structure,"We examined the work and thinking of students who were learning how to fi nd the distance between two points in a coordinate plane. This traditional content knowledge, however, is almost a side benefi t to the real value of the lesson. The lesson was purposefully designed to enact the three teaching practices listed above, with the aims of both highlighting the underlying structure of the distance formula and supporting  students in developing strategies to seek underlying mathematical structure in problem situations where it is not readily apparent. Students spent one 55-minute class period working through problems in small groups. They had previously learned how to use the Pythagorean theorem to fi nd side lengths of right triangles but had not studied coordinate geometry beyond plotting points.",7,The Search for Hidden Structure

9,The Search for Hidden Structure,"There are many ways to scaffold a mathematics lesson. One possibility is to use exercises that seem routine when viewed individually but build on one another to allow students to investigate different aspects of a concept. In a classroom science laboratory experiment, steps are often laid out for students so that scientifi c structure can be revealed. The collection of mathematical problems in this lesson functions similarly: The steps of the experiment are laid out for students to guide them to unveil the underlying mathematical structure. ",9,The Search for Hidden Structure
10,The Search for Hidden Structure,"Early in the lesson, students  found the distance between A(3, 2) and B(10, 2); between A(–6, 2) and B(5, 2); and between A(–375, 2) and B(–101, 2). Students activated the ",10,The Search for Hidden Structure

14,The Search for Hidden Structure,"These strategies guide students to seek the meaning, context, and purpose of a given situation and help them fi nd underlying structure that provides insight and explanatory power. Below, we discuss how students worked with these problems and how that helped them execute the strategies above. The problems are “low threshold” in nature; that is, they are problems that all students can approach in some way, using the knowledge they already have. This feature is critical for allowing students to conduct experiments via concrete calculations.",14,The Search for Hidden Structure

18,The Search for Hidden Structure,"Others saw that A is 6 units to the left of the y-axis and that B is 5 units to the right; hence, their distance is 6 + 5 = 11 (see fi g. 2). ",18,The Search for Hidden Structure
19,The Search for Hidden Structure,"With A(–375, 2) and B(–101, 2), even those who had previously counted grid boxes now thought algebraically. Many computed the distance by 375 − 101 = 274, since the points lie on the same side of the y-axis. Others computed –101 – (–375) = 274. ",19,The Search for Hidden Structure
20,The Search for Hidden Structure,Lesson Design,20,The Search for Hidden Structure
21,The Search for Hidden Structure,"Through these problems, the teacher exposed students to the mathematical practice of repeating the same calculations. Several students commented on this explicitly by noting, “The  y-coordinates are the same again” or “We’re using the same process as before.” They wondered when they should add—as some did with A(–6, 2) and B(5, 2)—and when they should subtract. The teacher led a discussion through which those who had used addition realized they could express their sum as a difference: 5 + 6 = 5 – (–6). They exclaimed, “Subtraction is addition! But it’s actually subtraction! So, if you don’t know what the number is—you subtract!” After conducting these repeated calculations, students began to unravel a general structure: They understood that the key to fi nding the distance between A and B is to fi nd the difference between their x-coordinates. ",21,The Search for Hidden Structure
22,The Search for Hidden Structure,"In these problems, students worked with points with the same y-coordinate, which served two purposes. First, students thought about distances in a simpler context. Second, students saw how one might choose special cases. SMP 1 suggests that when seeking to understand the meaning of a problem  (i.e., its underlying structure), students “try special cases and simpler forms of the original problem in order to gain insight into its solution” (CCSSI 2010, p. 6). As with repeated calculations, working with these simpler, special cases allowed students to unveil the hidden structure. Moreover, the larger coordinates in A(–375, 2) and B(–101, 2) encouraged students to generalize their approaches while still working in a concrete setting, because it was impractical to count boxes.",22,The Search for Hidden Structure

27,The Search for Hidden Structure,"The next problem came in two parts. The fi rst part asked students to describe in words how to fi nd the distance between arbitrary points A(x1, 2) and B(x2, 2). The second part asked them to express their description as an algebraic formula. (Note: There was an analogous problem in which A and B formed a vertical line segment.) This problem fostered students’ practice of using language to acquire clarity and understanding by engaging them with these strategies: •  Giving precise descriptions of the steps in a process (Cuoco, Goldenberg, and Mark 1996); and •  Using defi nitions to further  understanding.",27,The Search for Hidden Structure

30,The Search for Hidden Structure,"To illustrate students’ use of language, we briefl y return to the concrete calculations from section 1. ",30,The Search for Hidden Structure
31,The Search for Hidden Structure,Students approached those problems by first describing how the pairs of points are related: •  “The points are in the same row.” •  “The two points are both the same  height.”  •  “This is a horizontal line between  points A and B.”  •  “The two points have the same  y-coordinate.” ,31,The Search for Hidden Structure
32,The Search for Hidden Structure,"These descriptions are listed in order of increasing precision. As the language that students used to describe the relationship became more precise—hence more operational—they could devise a way to find the desired distance. By articulating that A and B have the same y-coordinate, students could determine the distance by focusing on their x-coordinates.",32,The Search for Hidden Structure
33,The Search for Hidden Structure,"In the more general setting, to describe how to find the distance between A(x1, 2) and B(x2, 2), some students did a case-by-case analysis (see fig. 3).",33,The Search for Hidden Structure

37,The Search for Hidden Structure,"dinate from the larger x-coordinate was a common approach. Many students found this method unsatisfying because they would need to know beforehand which x-coordinate is larger. Finkelstein remarked in the postlesson interview that— conversion from words to formula is not a natural thing to do. They don’t trust the algebraic formula. They ask themselves, “Does it cover all cases, all possible positive and negative combinations?” When they write x2 − x1, they’re not sure which one is bigger, which one is negative, and so on.",37,The Search for Hidden Structure
38,The Search for Hidden Structure,"Students said to each other, “There  should be some way to say we need the positive answer.” They eventually concluded that they must find the  absolute value of the difference between x1 and x2 (see fig. 4). ",38,The Search for Hidden Structure

40,The Search for Hidden Structure,"We already discussed how students’ precise description of the relationship between points such as A(–375, 2) and B(–101, 2) allowed them to efficiently find the distance. Here, we will analyze how the lesson allowed students to use the definition of absolute value to further their understanding. These students had previously learned that |a − b| is the distance between numbers a and b. Finkelstein noted, however, “They needed the chance to use it in a setting like this to make the idea come alive and be meaningful.” By providing them an opportunity to use the definition of absolute value when finding distances in the coordinate plane, the teacher helped students make sense of what absolute value really means. This is a powerful notion. A definition is better understood (and appreciated) when employed later in meaningful situations, such as using it as a tool to solve a seemingly unrelated problem.  Conversely, using definitions often ",40,The Search for Hidden Structure

78,The Search for Hidden Structure," We end this article with two  questions: 1. We want students to develop the mathematical maturity to search for underlying structure. We believe this happened for some but not for all students during this lesson. We wonder what we could add to a lesson like this to promote the kind of thinking that searches for underlying meaning. Or does it just happen over time if students engage with many activities like this one?  2. This activity modeled the use of scaffolds that decomposed unfamiliar problems to help students seek structure more easily. Eventually, we want all students to be able to break down a problem on their own. How could we construct students’ mathematical experiences over time so they can reach this overarching goal?",78,The Search for Hidden Structure
