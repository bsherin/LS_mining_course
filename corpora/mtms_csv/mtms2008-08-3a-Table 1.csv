introducing volume 14 reflection time!,0,mtms2008-08-3a,,
"It is with excitement that we bring you volume 14 of Mathematics Teaching in the Middle School (MTMS). You will find articles that offer specific ideas on teaching a variety of topics in middle-grades mathematics, delve into critical issues about curriculum, and engage learners (and teachers) in stimulating mathematical experiences. ",1,mtms2008-08-3a,,
"MTMS is adding a new feature  to various articles called “Reflect and Discuss” to help us reflect on our teaching by considering the impact of certain ideas, activities, and processes on the teaching and learning of mathematics. To mathematicians, reflect may refer to bending an object at an angle or a type of transformation. In teaching, we often hear about the need to reflect on or think about our teaching and its impact on student learning. We hope that you, as a reader, find this new section useful. We also look forward to your feedback regarding its inclusion. It can be used not only for individual professional development but also as a discussion topic among a group of teachers and as a platform for engaging the mathematical community about important issues in the teaching and learning of mathematics. As you reflect, we hope you will find it a transforming experience.",2,mtms2008-08-3a,,
"MTMS will continue to present the regular departments of “Mathematical Explorations,” “Cartoon Corner,” “Palette of Problems,” and “Solve It!” in conjunction with “The Thinking of Students,” all intended to provide thoughtful, challenging problem-solving adventures. Current research, timely topics, and  critical issues that face middle-grades mathematics educators today will be addressed in “Families Ask,” “Mathematical Roots,” “Take Time for Action,” “Quick Reads,” “Readers Write,” and “On My Mind.” ",3,mtms2008-08-3a,,
"In this volume, you will also find articles that tie in to the 2008–2009 Professional Development Focus of the Year, “Learning and Equity.” The April issue will focus on developing concepts of algebra, an essential building block of mathematics. ",4,mtms2008-08-3a,,
"Remember that MTMS wants you, our readers, to share your experiences, ideas, successes, and learning as you work with middle-grades students, current and prospective classroom teachers, and families. We welcome your feedback on articles and departments. You are encouraged to write to  us about your thoughts on topics in the journal, as well as your experiences implementing ideas from articles that inspire you. Be sure to check out the NCTM’s Web site at www.nctm.org and follow the links for Mathematics Teaching in the Middle School. You will find current calls for manuscript topics, guidelines for submissions, and articles from current and past issues. Be sure to see the “Call for Manuscripts for the 2010 Focus Issue: Technology in the Middle Grades” in this issue.",5,mtms2008-08-3a,,
"The MTMS Editorial Panel wishes  you a wonderful school year filled with exciting, engaging mathematics. While reading MTMS, ask yourself, “What will I find transforming as I reflect this year?”  ",6,mtms2008-08-3a,,
