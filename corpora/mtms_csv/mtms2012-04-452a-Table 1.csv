SEARCHING FOR A GOOD BOOK,4,mtms2012-04-452a,,
"I really enjoyed the October 2011 article “Geometry Sleuthing in Literature” about using literature in the math classroom. During summer 2011, I took a graduate-level math education course in which the professor mentioned the idea of reading a math ﬁ ction novel with students. I was intrigued because I am always looking for ways to integrate other subjects in my prealgebra class, especially literature. ",5,mtms2012-04-452a,,
"As I was searching for a book to assign to my class, I ran across The Unknowns: A Mystery by Benedict Carey. The story is set on a small industrial island where two middleschool-age students ﬁ nd that the town’s beloved math tutor, Mrs. Clark, is missing. Clark leaves mathematical clues that lead them not only to her kidnappers but also to a mystery much larger than the island itself. ",6,mtms2012-04-452a,,
"This is a heart-racing mystery that middle school students will enjoy. The math clues in the book are enriching for middle school students in prealgebra and algebra. Many of the clues would be great kick starts to concepts such as the Pythagorean theorem, combinations and coordinate pairs, and many more topics. ",7,mtms2012-04-452a,,

MATHEMATICAL INTUITION,12,mtms2012-04-452a,,
"I was thrilled to read “Teaching to Intuition” by Edric Cane in the November 2011 issue. Just the other day, I asked my seventh graders to add 4 bananas and 7 apples, so I was glad to read that my little insightful moment was on target. The author expressed so clearly my personal beliefs about teaching and learning mathematics; I do not think about, or adhere to, these beliefs often enough. As a relatively new teacher, I ﬁ nd it challenging to intentionally and consistently not teach formulas and rules when you are surrounded by the assumption that you will do so. ",13,mtms2012-04-452a,,
"In the article, the author mentioned a similar approach to teaching operations with integers that met with great success. Having just assessed integer addition and subtraction with less than acceptable results, I was wondering what strategies exist. Also, since I believe that this article is worthy of attention, I plan to share it with teachers, administrators, and families. Thank you so much for inspiring  me.",14,mtms2012-04-452a,,

"I am convinced that a signiﬁ cant  shift in what we think of as knowing math could work marvels at the level of numeracy in this country and that it will take ideas from many to  develop such an approach. In October 2011, I spent a few days at the SACNAS (Society for the Advancement of Chicano and Native Americans in Science) national conference in San Jose, California. There were 3000 university, graduate, and postdoctoral minority students pursuing various paths in medicine, chemistry, and all the other sciences who were connecting with mentors, graduate schools, and government agencies. It was an impressive group. I was invited there because the association knows that the major obstacle to a signiﬁ cantly greater number of minority students pursuing such studies is the lack of basic mathematical abilities and the fear of math at the level that you are teaching and that MTMS serves.
