6,"Book, Product, _ Software Reviews (March 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","The Impact of Identity in K-8 Mathematics by Aguirre, Mayfield-Ingram, and Martin describes the importance of attending to student and teacher identities in mathematics teaching. Through the artful use of vignettes describing classroom issues, the authors help readers understand the intertwined nature of studentsâ€™ conceptions of mathematics, mathematics learning, and complex intersecting identities. This book provides a readable synthesis of important research and resources to promote teacher reflection, while providing practical teaching advice and classroom resources.",,
7,"Book, Product, _ Software Reviews (March 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","The authors offer five equity-based teaching practices for mathematics classrooms with resources for teachers who wish to begin using the practices. For example, the authors present a vignette of a classroom situation in which a teacher responded to studentsâ€™ claims that Mexican students were suspended more often than other students. The teacherâ€™s response involved designing a mathematics task in which students delved into a rigorous study of concepts related to proportional reasoning. The authors clearly point out the five equity-based mathematics teaching practices in the teachersâ€™ lessons, along with the lesson materials created by the teacher. The synergy of the vignettes, the descriptions of the five equity-based practices, and the classroom materials make the cases in the book particularly useful for mathematics teachers and teacher educators.",,
8,"Book, Product, _ Software Reviews (March 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics",This book will be helpful for practicing teachers with an interest in promoting equity in their mathematics classrooms and is a good choice for teacher study groups working on mathematics teaching and equity issues.,,

16,"Book, Product, _ Software Reviews (March 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","The strongest section is at the end, in chapter fiveâ€™s â€œManagement Strategies.â€ Johnsen, Ryser, and Assouline give specific advice on designing a classroom to reach all learners. For example, they write, â€œInvolve the students in planning and setting up some of the (learning) centersâ€ (p. 96). The authors recommend having students create their own problems. This allows the teacher to use student problems in station work, giving students ownership of their classroom.",,
17,"Book, Product, _ Software Reviews (March 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","An issue throughout chapter four, â€œDifferentiated Learning Experiences,â€ is the inconsistent use of italics. The authors incorrectly note that all italics will show how advanced lessons differ from typical lessons. I also question the layout structure of the table. It is difficult to read. Perhaps the authors could write typical lessons and add italicized text in the lesson to offer suggestions for advanced students.",,
18,"Book, Product, _ Software Reviews (March 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics",The authors should also note that students could jump from â€œtypicalâ€ to â€œadvancedâ€ at any time. They seem to imply that students are either typical or advanced and should be treated differently. It should be acknowledged that students can show growth at any time.,,

24,"Book, Product, _ Software Reviews (March 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Author Jerry Knoelke begins by explaining that many students come to math class with a preconceived notion that math is a â€œmysticalâ€ subject. He points out that math requires the use of five simple steps, remembered with the acronym â€œPRESS.â€ The PRESS method emphasizes drawing pictures to solve word problems, which the author claims will simplify the world of math for students. Knoelke explains that using their imagination to decode the problem can help students feel that math is more accessible to them.",,
25,"Book, Product, _ Software Reviews (March 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","The vast majority of the book comprises examples, which the author explains in detail, for middle school and high school math classes. Although these examples would not be easy to photocopy, teachers could use them in their classes with a little reformatting. Teachers may be part of the targeted audience in the few opening pages, but this quickly changes. When reading through the examples, it feels as though the author is talking to a teenage student, with smiley faces and puns included throughout.",,
26,"Book, Product, _ Software Reviews (March 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","The PRESS method is not a cure-all for struggling math students, as students will still need to know how to complete calculations once they determine what the question is asking, but the process could be useful for some students. I hesitantly recommend this book for teachers looking for a method to use with visual learners who struggle with decoding math problems.",,

33,"Book, Product, _ Software Reviews (March 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","The illustrations are vibrant, entertaining, and complement the story well. The character names are clever and amusing. However, this episode is not as compelling as other Sir Cumference storylines. Some parts in the story are confusing and not intuitive, leaving the reader wanting a tighter and believable storyline and ending.",,
34,"Book, Product, _ Software Reviews (March 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","A math teacher could use this book as a supplement to teaching data displays or how to decide which method to collect and display data, but the story lacks the strength to be memorable. There are just too many loose ends and questionable events; the story feels a bit too forced. Do all the towns-people sample all eight of the selections and then vote on their favorite? That is a lot of sweet-eating. And the fact that thirty votes are conveniently cast for each of the bakerâ€™s specialties detracts from the opportunity to teach real-life statistics through a story.",,

Pieces are rearranged to fit inside two square frames to prove that the areas of both are congruent. Students are then asked what they can conclude from the relationship between a 2, b 2, and c 2.",,
43,"Book, Product, _ Software Reviews (March 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","This would be a useful discovery activity in a Math 8 classroom. It would be beneficial in a geometry classroom for recalling prior knowledge, studying distance on a coordinate grid, understanding obtuse and acute triangles versus right triangles, and understanding the formula for the equation of a circle. Having hands-onexperiences with the Pythagorean theorem not only engages students but also helps to solidify concepts.",,
44,"Book, Product, _ Software Reviews (March 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","At least one set of this product is recommended for each teacher who teaches the Pythagorean theorem. Additional tile sets could foster communication skills, with students working together with a partner to discover and express what they learned. These tiles would be helpful to use at the beginning of a unit and any time when teachers are making connections to the Pythagorean theorem. This would be an appropriate resource to move students through a concrete-to-representational-to-abstract sequence of instruction, developing understanding of the Pythagorean theorem.",,
