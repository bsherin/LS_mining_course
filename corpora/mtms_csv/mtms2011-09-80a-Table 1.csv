Get your students to rally around the connections between mathematics and tennis.,1,mtms2011-09-80a,,
"mMathematics is everywhere. Some  examples are so obvious that they do not need to be pointed out. However, as teachers we have a major responsibility to help students uncover mathematics in everyday situations. Toward that end, we are continuously challenged to present rich everyday situations that use mathematics and then pose questions to engage students in problem solving. ",2,mtms2011-09-80a,,
"In our dual roles as mathematics teachers and tennis coaches, we have worked with tennis players who have never thought about how a knowledge of mathematics might help them become better tennis players. We have  also worked with many mathematics students who have never considered how much mathematics is associated with tennis. This article explores how we have used both to help students see the mathematics in their tennis game. The problems and activities also help answer the question we frequently hear: “When are we ever going to use this stuff?” (Although this article focuses exclusively on connecting mathematics and tennis, other sports—such as football, soccer, baseball, and basketball—and their specifi c playing surfaces can provide rich environments for making mathematical connections.)  mathematics, mathematics, anyone? geoMetRY: hidden oR eMBedded FigURes Hidden fi gures, frequently encountered in geometry, are often troublesome for students who fi nd it diffi cult to see or fi nd them. On a bulletin board, we post an illustration of a tennis court (see fi g. 1) and this question: “How many rectangles can you fi nd?” This investigation provides an open-ended problem-solving opportunity that explores some obvious as well as hidden, or embedded, rectangles. Students readily accept this challenge. Although all thirtyone rectangles are not usually found by everyone, every student fi nds several. Students use various strategies to count the rectangles; some are systematic, whereas others are less organized (see fi gs. 2a and 2b). During this activity, we frequently hear this response from our students: “I have seen a tennis court, but I never thought about it containing rectangles.”  congRUence and sYMMetRY All tennis courts have the same dimensions. Figure 1 shows that one side of the court is the mirror image of the other; the net serves as one line of symmetry. The centerline provides a second line of symmetry for both sides of the court. A closer look at the dimensions of a tennis court (see fi g. 3) shows that each rectangle on one side of the net has a congruent rectangle on the other. In fact, any hidden fi gure on one side of either line of symmetry has a congruent fi gure on the other side of the line of symmetry.",3,mtms2011-09-80a,,

"Students often comment, “I have seen a tennis court, but I never thought about it containing rectangles.”  going to select one of these pieces of yarn to wrap around the can exactly once, which length would be the best fi t?” Although our students have worked with the formula C = πd, they rarely choose the correct yarn length. They seem to be driven by their perceptions, rather than considering the length of yarn and its relationship to the height of the tennis can containing three balls. It takes some prompting to help students make the connection among the diameter of the tennis balls, the height of the can, and how these two factors are related to the circumference of the can. Once that happens, they experience an aha! moment.",14,mtms2011-09-80a,,
PeRiMeteR All tennis courts have the same dimensions. Tennis players often drill and condition by running the long lines from baseline to baseline (78 feet) or running from one side of the baseline to the other (36 feet) (see fi g. 3). These physical drills can also provide the basis for some multistep computation. ,15,mtms2011-09-80a,,
Let’s look at the lines around a  singles and a doubles court. The total length of all the lines around a singles court is and have the ball land in the opponent’s court. This objective provides an opportunity to explore area. The area of one side of a singles court is  (78 feet × 2) + (27 feet × 2); 78 ft. × 27 ft. = 2106 ft.2.  the total length of all the lines around a doubles court is ,16,mtms2011-09-80a,,
The area of one side of a doubles court is  (78 feet × 2) + (36 feet × 2).,17,mtms2011-09-80a,,
78 ft. × 36 ft. = 2808 ft.2.,18,mtms2011-09-80a,,
"In either case, patterns emerge for determining the total length of the distance. We always ask students to explain how each value in their expression connects to the tennis court. We also ask if anyone solved the problem differently, and someone usually presents a unique approach. An explanation of a different approach provides another opportunity for students to view the values in their expression and connect them to the physical dimensions of a tennis court.",19,mtms2011-09-80a,,
aReas oF Rectangles One of the objectives when playing tennis is to hit the ball over the net ,20,mtms2011-09-80a,,
"A natural question to ask is this: “How much larger is the doubles court than the singles court?” The length of the court is the same. Since the two alleys add a total of 9 feet to the width of the court, the area increases by 9/27, or 1/3. Two people who are playing doubles need to cover one-third more court than one person who is playing singles. That number helps explain why people play more doubles tennis as they grow older. ",21,mtms2011-09-80a,,
"The areas of the singles and  doubles court represent two rectangular areas. Many other rectangular areas can be found, including the alleys and  service boxes. Each of these rectangles provides an opportunity for additional problem solving.  aReas oF lines",22,mtms2011-09-80a,,
"In geometry, the term area of a line would be an oxymoron, because a line has no width. However, a line on a tennis court does have width. A ball that lands on the line is considered good. Typically all the lines (except the baselines) have a width of two inches. In general, baselines are wider, usually four inches, which help a player make a call on those balls landing either on or close to the baseline. An interesting question to pose to students is this: “If a ball clears the net and lands in the doubles court, what is the probability of the ball hitting a line?” To fi nd the solution requires calculating the areas of all the lines. Figure 5 shows calculations for the areas of different lines. However, there are many intersections of two lines. An examination of the tennis court shows six intersections of twoinch lines, so their overlap would be 6 × 4 in.2. There are eight intersections of a two-inch and a four-inch line, so their overlap would be 8 × 8 in.2 and 6 × 4 in.2, which total 88 in.2 of overlap, or 11/18 ft.2. If a ball lands on the doubles court, it could land in any of the 2808 ft.2; of that area, 91.39 ft.2 will be  lines. The probability of a ball touching a line if landing in the court is  91.39 ft.2 ÷ 2808 ft.2 = .0325, or about 3 percent. (Note: Balls skid when they hit the court. Given that a ball lands in the court, this percentage refl ects the likelihood of any part of the skid touching a line.)  siMilaR tRiangles",23,mtms2011-09-80a,,
"When a player is serving, the tennis ball needs to clear the net and land in the service box. The better serves land near or on the line in the service box and either near the centerline or the far (outside) side. For this math-andtennis problem, we will assume that the server is standing very near the center of the baseline. Furthermore, we will assume that the server wants his or her serve to barely clear the net and land on the line in the service box. (For this problem, we also assume that the serve travels in a straight line.) Consider this question: “How high should the server strike the ball so that it barely clears the net and lands on the service line?” Figure 6 shows a cross section of the court, including the height of the net at the center, the distance from the net to the end of the service box, and the distance from the net to where the ",24,mtms2011-09-80a,,

"In tennis, coaches encourage players to hit the ball crosscourt for two reasons: (1) the ball travels over the center of the net, which is lowest in the center; and (2) the ball is less likely to go long (beyond the baseline). The Pythagorean theorem helps to explain the latter. Figure 7 shows how a right triangle is formed when hitting crosscourt. The maximum distance from one corner of the court to the other is the hypotenuse of the right triangle. If you are on a doubles court and hit the ball down the line with the same pace you hit it crosscourt, your ball will be over 8 feet long (see fi g. 8).",70,mtms2011-09-80a,,

"the ball will determine the direction of the flight of the ball. For example, when a player is hitting the ball straight ahead, the racket head should be perpendicular to the oncoming ball. If the angle of the racket head is off by a few degrees, it can have a significant effect on the path of the ball. For an illustration of this angle’s importance, see the triangle in figure 9a. The tangent of an angle is determined by the ratio of the length of the vertical and horizontal sides of the triangle. If a player is standing on the baseline at the center of a court and his or her racket strikes the ball perpendicularly, the ball should be returned to the center of the other court. However, if the racket strikes the ball at a 10 degree angle (rather than perpendicularly), the ball will follow another path. Figure 9b shows this path: The ball will travel nearly 14 feet from the center of the baseline. The angle of the racket as it strikes the ball can have a dramatic impact on the direction the ball will travel. A few of the challenges of tennis include controlling the angle that a racket strikes the ball while a player is running from one side to another. Although mathematics may not be on a player’s mind when chasing down a shot, it clearly becomes an important factor in determining the fate of his or her return shot.",77,mtms2011-09-80a,,
"To stimulate further thinking  and discussion about mathematics  and tennis, we often post number facts on a bulletin board to remind students that mathematics is everywhere.
