0,Mardi Gras Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"""Throw me something, mister!"" is one of the most common phrases heard at one of the most extravagant and recognizable celebrations. During the final two weeks of the Mardi Gras season, the city of New Orleans welcomes hundreds of thousands, sometimes millions, of people to the citywide celebration. The world-famous parades are an integral part of the New Orleans Mardi Gras celebration. These parades are organized by clubs and groups of people called ""krewes"" who ride in the parade on vehicles called floats. ""An 18-float procession of a 200-member krewe may feature more than 75 units. When band members, dance groups, posses, clown units and motorcycle squadrons are all added up, it is not uncommon for the number of participants to total more than 3,000"" (Hardy 1996). Although security, weather, and traffic issues can all present challenges for Mardi Gras planners, we were able to pull variables out of the planning process to create a fun-filled eighth-grade math activity that focused on parade planning.",,
1,Mardi Gras Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The ""Prepare and Inspire"" report on STEM education states, ""Students need opportunities to establish deeper engagement with and to learn science and mathematics in non-standard, personal and team-oriented ways that extend beyond the curriculum and the classroom"" (PCAST 2010). Our activity was designed to enhance and supplement the eighth-grade algebra curriculum on linear equations and functions, help students use mathematical habits of mind, and demonstrate the uses of mathematics in future career choices in an engaging, nontraditional way. Overall, it is our hope that having students engage in mathematical modeling activities will ""assist students' acquisition and understanding of mathematical concepts, notions, methods, results and topics"" (Niss 1989).",,
2,Mardi Gras Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,INTRODUCTION TO THE MARDI GRAS MATH ACTIVITY,,
3,Mardi Gras Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"This activity was completed in one class period, in eighth-grade algebra classes containing twenty to twenty-five students. It served as an interactive, culminating group activity on linear equations. Most, if not all, of the students knew very little about Mardi Gras. As an introduction, students watched a short film on the celebration and traditions of Mardi Gras (National Geographic 2011).",,
4,Mardi Gras Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"After a short discussion, we asked students about any experiences they had related to this celebration. We were surprised to learn that one student observed the Mardi Gras King Cake tradition with her family: ""The cake part with the baby is something my family does as a tradition, too, except whoever gets the baby in their slice has to host and cook for the next family party."" We also discussed some issues that may arise in parade planning, such as security, traffic, and neighborhood disturbance. The students were then given a set of questions (see fig. 1), and told that they were on the planning committee for a Mardi Gras parade. Their job was to determine the route for the Krewe de Fun parade. Linear equations and points on an 
  x-y

  grid identified streets and attractions. We used street names and points of interest from the city of New Orleans to connect to the Mardi Gras theme. We had students assume that all streets were linear and that there were no curved streets. Students used the questions to help the committee plan the Krewe de Fun's parade route.",,
5,Mardi Gras Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,MATH PRACTICES AND HABITS OF MIND,,
6,Mardi Gras Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Although this activity was created before the release of the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSI 2010), we found that it aligns well with ""analyze and solve linear equations and pairs of simultaneous linear equations"" and ""define, evaluate, and compare functions"" in the Grade 8 domain (CCSSI 2010, p. 53; standards 8.EE.C7, 8.EEC.8, 8.F.A.1, and 8.F.A.3).",,
7,Mardi Gras Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"This activity also cultivates several of the Common Core's Standards for Mathematical Practice (SMP), in particular, SMP 1: Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them and SMP 3: Construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others (CCSSI 2010). The activity requires students to ""analyze givens, constraints, relationships, and goals"" because students have to make linear functions and determine relationships between linear functions and coordinate points based on certain requirements (CCSSI 2010, p. 6). The last scenario in the activity challenges students to mathematically justify their recommendation about where the parade should end. Students are required to analyze the given suggestions and make ""plausible arguments that take into account the context from which the data arose"" (CCSSI 2010, p. 7).",,
8,Mardi Gras Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"This activity also aims to help develop some mathematical habits of mind (Cuoco, Goldenberg, and Mark 1996). We felt it was important to develop an algebra activity reiterating some mathematical habits of mind to help solidify the processes involved in algebraic reasoning. ""Developing mathematical habits of mind in the middle grades is essential for students who are making the critical transition from arithmetic to algebra"" (Mark et al. 2010, p. 505). Therefore, our aim was to help students make that transition more smoothly. Some of the mathematical habits that this activity focused on are the following:",,
9,Mardi Gras Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Visualizing math: Constructing mental and/or physical visual representations to better understand the math involved,,
10,Mardi Gras Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Using functions: Using a rule or relationship to represent the real situation mathematically,,
11,Mardi Gras Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Performing good calculations: Using operations, numbers, and variables to calculate logically and strategically",,
12,Mardi Gras Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Using algebraic representations and algorithms: Using a procedure or process to calculate or reason about a mathematical situation,,
13,Mardi Gras Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Mixing deduction and experiment: Experimenting and reasoning simultaneously to find the best solution to a problem,,
14,Mardi Gras Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Breaking things into parts: Decomposing an algebraic system or equation to unpack the underlying structure,,
15,Mardi Gras Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,STUDENT APPROACHES AND FINDINGS,,
16,Mardi Gras Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"After we gave students the set of questions, many were unsure how to start. Initially, most students chose to graph the first two lines from question 1 (see 
  fig. 1

  ). After completing question 1, many realized that they could proceed without graphing each line or coordinate point, and they answered the remaining questions about solving systems of linear equations. Dialogue involved the appropriate use of tools (SMP 5) in which students discussed whether or not it was best to continue with graph paper. Some students commented, ""You can save more time without graphing."" Only a few students felt that they needed both equations and graphical representations to better visualize the math. (See one student's work in 
  fig. 2

  .)",,
17,Mardi Gras Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
18,Mardi Gras Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
19,Mardi Gras Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Inherently, students used linear functions in this activity. Although representations of these linear functions were given in various forms of linear equations (i.e., coordinates of two points on a line, slope-intercept, and standard form), students were comfortable translating the various equations from one form to the next because this point of emphasis was made when they were taught linear equations. A common misconception that led to a lot of discussion involved many students assuming that they could use estimation solely to tell whether or not certain points of interest were on certain streets. They felt that it was unnecessary to test if coordinate points satisfied the equations. Many used invalid reasoning for their estimations and did not get the correct answer.",,
20,Mardi Gras Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Some mathematical dialogue around this issue involved students critiquing the reasoning of others as they urged their classmates to graph and verify that the estimated answers they found were not possible. We had to constantly reiterate the importance of working through the problems by developing and solving appropriate equations and performing good calculations to properly answer the questions. We also helped them understand that for a real parade planner, an estimation that led to a wrong decision could cost thousands of dollars.",,
21,Mardi Gras Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Students noticed that they were repeatedly being asked to find points of intersection for lines. They immediately started formulating algorithms to find points of intersection for linear functions. Many placed equations in point-slope form, setting equations equal, and then solving for the point of intersection. (See 
  fig. 3

  for a sample of a student's solution to questions 1-3, in which she used the previously mentioned algorithm.)",,
22,Mardi Gras Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
23,Mardi Gras Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The questions in 
  figure 1

  were designed to build on one another, thus encouraging students to develop the mathematical habit of taking problems apart. The initial concern in the activity was to determine a parade route using lines and coordinate points. The questions were structured so that students actually created the parade route by addressing a series of smaller questions. However, the last question of the activity challenged students to address the important concern of where the parade would end in a way that promoted deduction and experimentation. This question presented students with three suggestions of where the parade should end and three reasons for those suggestions.",,
24,Mardi Gras Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"This Mardi Gras scenario contains many issues, both mathematical and social, which engaged students in using SMP 1 and 3 when they analyzed each suggestion, checked the sensibility of the suggestions, and verified whether the suggestions were mathematically possible. This problem also gave students a sense of attachment to the situation and ownership of the outcome of the problem, leaving them feeling more connected to the problem.",,
25,Mardi Gras Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Initially, many students deduced without experimenting that the answer to question 4, where the parade should end, should be (b) because it made the most sense in the context of the problem. They quickly wrote that as their answer. When we saw this occurring, we asked probing questions, ""Where do Conti Street and Douglas Street intersect?"" and ""Is this the only logical answer?"" We also encouraged some students to reason completely through each suggestion as many said they picked (c) based on mental computations and because they felt it was a good answer. We led them to understand that even though (c) might be the best choice, they were required to construct a written argument with mathematical justification explaining why their choice was best and why the other options were not optimal as though they were advising a real planning committee.",,
26,Mardi Gras Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Some students were unsure of the amount of justification needed to completely answer question 4 as they continued to think a yes or no answer sufficed. As they remained unsure, we have included additional instructions for question 4. (See 
  fig. 4

  's student work showing responses to question 4 with justifications for the choices made.)",,
27,Mardi Gras Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Fig. 4 Students responded to question 4, where to end the parade, in various ways.",,

30,Mardi Gras Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,(a) (b) (c),,
31,Mardi Gras Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
32,Mardi Gras Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We also noticed that students seemed most comfortable transforming the linear equations to slope-intercept form although in some situations it may have been computationally faster to manipulate standard form equations. For example, question 4 presented an equation in the form 2 
  x

  + 5 
  y

  = 1, and many of the students converted this equation to point-slope form before reading the remainder of the question. Although we assumed that most students would do this to help analyze suggestion (b), we were surprised when they converted the standard form equation in suggestion (c) to point-slope form and then solved for the intersection point. After the activity, we discussed other ways that we could have analyzed suggestion (c). One student commented, ""I thought about viewing the equations in standard form, but it would have been more challenging to solve.""",,
33,Mardi Gras Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,REAL-LIFE MATH WITH A PURPOSE,,
34,Mardi Gras Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Similar to Mardi Gras, we wanted to end with a party, so we ended the activity by having the students pretend to be parade-goers. Many students commented on how much fun they had and said that they thought this was an interesting activity. Here are a few students' comments:",,
35,Mardi Gras Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"""Math is easier to understand when it is tied to something fun and interesting.""",,
36,Mardi Gras Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"""Doing math like this really shows its purpose in life outside the classroom.""",,
37,Mardi Gras Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"""It makes math seem more fun than just problems on a paper.""",,
38,Mardi Gras Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"This modeling activity also gave the students a different view of algebra in connection to a holiday, Mardi Gras, and to the career field of urban planning. Students who completed this activity were interested and engaged in finding reasonable and logical solutions to the questions raised. They also took a personal interest in this activity because they were able to decide the final outcome. In the future we plan to use this activity over two class periods, which would allow for more student reflection time and would include more linear forms as suggestions in question 4.",,
39,Mardi Gras Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Mathematically, this activity gave students the opportunity to use their algebraic reasoning abilities with linear equations and functions. They were also able to investigate mathematical problems strategically and logically, fostering the development of mathematical practices and habits of mind. Students developed an awareness of how algebra can be used to model real-life situations. They also developed flexibility in representing and analyzing linear equations while enhancing their techniques in finding solutions to linear equations. Ultimately, through student reflection, we learned that students found this to be an enjoyable activity, which helped to boost students' confidence in their algebraic manipulation skills.",,
