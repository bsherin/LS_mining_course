This “Solve This “Solve It!” task It!” task appeared in appeared in the February the February 2011 issue: 2011 issue: ,60,mtms2011-10-132a,,
The following tile pattern is composed of three different tiles:  • Gray tiles are 6 in. × 6 in. • Black tiles are 1 ft. × 1 ft. • White tiles are 6 in. × 1 ft. ,61,mtms2011-10-132a,,
"This tile pattern is used to cover a rectangular room that is 11 ft. × 18 ft. An installer will start by ﬁ nding the center of the fl oor, using diagonal lines, and then begin tiling from the center of the ﬂ oor, as shown below. Assume that the installer can cut tiles and use any pieces to complete the pattern.  1. How many of each color of tile will be used to cover the entire fl oor?  2. What percentage of the room is covered with each color of tile? Show all your work, and explain your thinking.",62,mtms2011-10-132a,,

Mooney, Illinois State University, Campus Box 4520, Normal, IL 61790-4520, or by e-mail to mooney@ilstu.edu. Published solutions will be credited.  sStudents found ways to both math- tile color needed to cover the floor, most students partitioned the floor layout on the basis of how much of the 4 ft. × 4 ft. tile pattern would fit. Lia and Lila showed that the floor plan consisted of these pattern  segments:  ematically and creatively walk all over this floor-tile problem. ",63,mtms2011-10-132a,,
"In determining the number of each  1. Three 4 ft. × 4 ft. 2. Six 4 ft. × 3 1/2 ft. 3. Four 3 ft. × 3 1/2 ft. 4. Two 3 ft. × 4 ft.  (See fig. 1.) Once the size of the floor was computed, students determined the number of white, black, and gray tiles needed for each particular  segment before calculating the total number of each color tile needed to cover the entire floor. Natalie and Sarita drew the entire tiled floor layout as well (see fig. 2).",64,mtms2011-10-132a,,
"To determine what percentage of  the room is covered with each color of tile, two strategies were used. The first strategy involved determining the area that each color tile covered and then dividing that number by the entire area of the floor. Isabella used this method to find the area (see fig. 3). The second way to determine the percentages was to convert the number of tiles and the entire floor into graytile units. Mike explained how he converted the areas covered into these gray-tile units (see fig. 4).",65,mtms2011-10-132a,,

Fig. 3 Isabella explained her solution to the second question using the number of tiles and their area.,87,mtms2011-10-132a,,
"To ﬁ nd the percent for the black tiles, I just had to divide 54 by 198 (198 is the total amount of square feet). I got 27%. To ﬁ nd the percent for the white tile, I divided 190 by 2 (because the white tile is 1/2 of a ft.2), then divided that by 198 and got 48%. To ﬁ nd the percent for the gray tiles, I divided 196 by 4 (because the gray tiles are 1/4 of a ft.2), then divided that by 198 and got 25%. ",88,mtms2011-10-132a,,
Fig. 4 Mike explored the second question by converting all tiles to their relative size to the gray tiles. ,89,mtms2011-10-132a,,
"To find the percentages, I converted the tile amounts all into gray tiles to make things a lot easier. I multiplied the 190 white tiles by 2 because there are 2 gray tiles for every 1 white tile, and the 54 black tiles by 3 because there are 4 gray tiles for every black tile. I ended up with 216 black tiles when converted into gray tiles and 380 white tiles when converted into gray tiles. To find the whole floor’s area in gray tiles, I added 196, 216 and 380 together. The sum, or whole, was 792 gray tiles. I divided the number of gray, black and white tiles’ equivalents in gray tiles by 792. I ended up with the following results:",90,mtms2011-10-132a,,
