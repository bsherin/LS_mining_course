"Success in algebra is a reliable predictor of success in college. Students who complete two years of high school algebra are more likely to earn bachelor’s degrees, giving them the opportunity to earn substantially more income than their non-college-bound peers (Rose and Betts 2001). Given the importance of algebra, middle school mathematics teachers have a responsibility to help students transition from understanding arithmetic to understanding the algebra that will be  ",5,mtms2011-02-368a,,

"Historically, when students have  patterns and forming relationships between pattern elements and their positions, rather than looking at both the recursive and dependence relationships that occur within any growing pattern (Warren 2005). Research has shown that middle school students have diffi culty understanding functions and transitioning from extending a growing pattern to identifying the relationship when both the recursive and functional relationships are not investigated (Redden 1996;  independent variable (graphed on the x-axis) and the dependent variable (graphed on the y-axis). They also identify the graph as being linear or curvilinear. In this context, the graph is linear. The “rate of change” that occurs with each additional table is a constant, namely, the 2 students per table. The teacher explains that this “rate of change” is called the slope of the line and that each change of 1 on the x-axis corresponds to a change of 2 on the y-axis. Students use the phrases “depends on” or “is a function of ” to describe the growing pattern. The class discussion and student responses allow the teacher to informally assess their understanding of the recursive and functional relationships, the dependent and independent variables, and the meaning of slope as a rate of change. Students’ inaccurate responses are also used as prompts for more discussion and exploration. For example, one student explained the + 2 in the functional relationship: “It’s plus 2 because every time you add another table, 2 more people can sit; like in the chart, it goes up by 2.” This response indicated  two functions graphed on the same axis allow  students to compare the two relations.

"Students then think algebraically and describe the functional relationship between t, the number of tables, and s, the number of seats around that number of tables.

These activities promote a conceptual understanding of functions. Oral and written language are used to describe both recursive and functional relationships; the inclusion of a variety of contexts; and the use of shapes for a geometric context. The geometric context allows students to make sense of patterns by using figural reasoning; they first notice the visual cues in the pattern and then translate them to a numeric sequence (Friel and Markworth 2009).  linear Functions: sloPe and y-intercePt,19,mtms2011-02-368a,,
This activity builds on the Dinner Table problem (Earnest and Balti 2008) and enables students to explore how changes in table size affect changes in the corresponding linear equation. This problem asks students to predict the number of seats that are needed for tables of varying sizes. An abbreviated version of the task is shown in figure 1a. Students complete a recording sheet and then discuss the growing pattern of square tables. They describe the recursive relationship within the pattern by explaining how the number of seats is increasing with each additional table. The teacher encourages students to visualize both the contextual increase of “adding 2 seats with each additional table” as well as the procedural increase of “+ 2.”  that the reason for the addition of 2 was misunderstood. Students are asked to re-create the pattern of tables using color tiles to clarify understanding. ,20,mtms2011-02-368a,,
"The next part of the lesson involves  a new pattern, as shown in figure 2a. Students complete the recording sheet and consider the recursive relationship. They identify the functional relationship in the context of the new rectangular tables, s = 2t + 4; explain how this formula can be visualized using the sides of each table configuration; and explain that the “+ 4” represents the 4 seats at the ends of the table (2 at each end). The second graph, created on the same coordinate plane as the first graph, is also linear and is parallel to the first graph. ",21,mtms2011-02-368a,,
"The similarities and differences between the two graphs are illustrated by the teacher drawing a stair step starting at each y-intercept. Students who are struggling can visualize how each successive point is the result of going up 2 units on the y-axis and 1 unit to the right on the x-axis. In discussing the similarities of the two equations, students notice that the coefficient of t, the slope, is the same. They articulate the difference between the two graphs: The lines are crossing the y-axis at different places, and the constant being added to “2t” is the y-intercept. ",22,mtms2011-02-368a,,
"When asked how the second line  could be described as a transformation of the first line, students respond, “It’s a slide.” This difference in y-intercepts creates a geometric translation of the original line, specifically, a vertical slide of 2 units. Students then describe the similarities and differences between the two graphs on their recording sheets. Their responses are used to informally assess how well they understand the algebraic concepts and the geometric concept of translation or slide.

" Students’ algebraic understanding of slope and y-intercept and their geometric understanding of slides in the context of banquet tables can be assessed through their interpretations of various equations.

Students can draw the diagonals directly on the cutouts since they are much larger and more manipulative than those on the recording sheet (see fi g. 4).",61,mtms2011-02-368a,,
"Students may incorrectly count  each diagonal twice. They then realize that they are getting different answers, so the teacher asks them to look again at the cutouts to help them count again. They fold the paper cutouts and count each additional crease or draw tick marks on each diagonal as it is counted. Each method helps students realize their counting error. Seeing that each diagonal has two endpoints helps students derive the formula for defi ning the functional relationship, which occurs later in the lesson. Students determine the number of diagonals and see that the number increases as the number of sides of the polygon increases, which defi nes the recursive relationship.

"Students then predict what the graph of the table of values will be, given that there is no constant increase. They identify the independent and dependent variables and graph the table of values. The teacher assesses algebraic understanding of this context and geometric understanding of diagonals of polygons through a fi nal discussion. Students indicate that this graph is not linear, but curvilinear, since the increase is not constant. They also explain why a triangle has no diagonals and why each vertex of any given polygon has three fewer diagonals adjacent to it than the number of sides of that polygon.

While students are folding the paper, they are asked the following:  •  What shapes were made? •  Are those shapes mathematically  similar to the original? •  Finish all ﬁ ve folds and look at your paper. Why does each fold result in rectangles? (Each fold is either parallel to the original rectangle’s width or length.) •  Why are the rectangles that were  made after the fi rst, third, and fi fth folds not similar to the original rectangle?  •  Why are the rectangles formed by the second and fourth folds similar? (Only in the second and  fourth folds did both the length and width get halved. Thus, the shapes resulting from two consecutive folds remain proportional to the original.)",74,mtms2011-02-368a,,
"Students then explain that— 1.  the number of regions is increasing with each fold (which is the recursive relationship); and  2.  the functional relationship is   r = 2f, where r represents regions and f represents the number of folds.
