0,Burgers and Fries_ Exploring Equivalent Expressions - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The ability to identify and generate equivalent expressions is an important skill in algebra. However, this skill is conceptually difficult for many students. Even when students are able to apply properties of operations, such as the distributive property, to generate an equivalent expression, they often view it as a rule-based manipulation of symbols rather than a process grounded in equivalence (Demby 1997).",,
1,Burgers and Fries_ Exploring Equivalent Expressions - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"One way to address this conceptual challenge is to give some additional information to students. Before introducing the use of properties of operations to generate equivalent expressions (transformation equivalence), allow students to see equivalence in particular contexts (description equivalence) (Zwetzschler and Prediger 2013). With transformative equivalence, the properties of operations, such as the distributive property, are applied to an expression to generate an equivalent expression (e.g., 3(x + 2) = 3x + 6). With description equivalence, equivalent expressions are generated by describing a particular situation, such as a geometric pattern, in different ways.",,
2,Burgers and Fries_ Exploring Equivalent Expressions - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,The lesson we describe in this article is based on description equivalence. The goal of the lesson is for students to be able to generate equivalent expressions from a pictorial representation of a particular scenario. This experience provides foundational knowledge for understanding what it means for expressions to be equivalent. We have taught this lesson to sixth graders in a sixty-minute period.,,
3,Burgers and Fries_ Exploring Equivalent Expressions - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,LESSON FOCUS,,
4,Burgers and Fries_ Exploring Equivalent Expressions - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The context for the lesson is ordering hamburgers and French fries (known hereafter as burgers and fries) at a fast-food restaurant. Throughout the lesson, students are asked to generate and interpret expressions that represent the burgers and fries ordered by a group of people, such as a family. The idea of equivalence emerges when students are asked to represent the total number of each item ordered and then to represent this order in terms of the number of items each family member receives, assuming that each family member receives the same number of burgers and fries. For example, a family of 2 might order 4 burgers and 2 fries, which can be represented as 4B + 2F. Representing the order in terms of what each person receives (2 burgers and 1 fry) is 2(2B + F), in which the initial 2 represents the number of family members and the expression inside the parentheses represents what each person received. Students then see that",,
5,Burgers and Fries_ Exploring Equivalent Expressions - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"4B + 2F = 2(2B + F),",,
6,Burgers and Fries_ Exploring Equivalent Expressions - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,which is grounded in contextual equivalence: the total number of burgers and fries viewed from the perspectives of the total order and the order shared among the family members. This is the essence of descriptive equivalence.,,
7,Burgers and Fries_ Exploring Equivalent Expressions - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,LESSON SET UP,,
8,Burgers and Fries_ Exploring Equivalent Expressions - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"To set up the lesson, print enough activity sheets and card sets for each student or each pair of students. (See the card-only page in this article.) Each card set should be cut into individual squares, shuffled, and clipped together. The three card sets will be handed out at different points in the lesson.",,
9,Burgers and Fries_ Exploring Equivalent Expressions - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"To begin the lesson, show students the menu in figure 1 and ask them what they might order from the menu.",,
10,Burgers and Fries_ Exploring Equivalent Expressions - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
11,Burgers and Fries_ Exploring Equivalent Expressions - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Then ask students to interpret expressions such as 2c + t + s in the context of the menu. Students generally suggest that this could mean 2 cheeseburgers, 1 tater tot, and 1 soda. Next, ask students to look at the first two columns on their activity sheet. They should understand that each row represents 1 order of burgers and fries, shown pictorially and in words. To support understanding, students can be asked to fill in blanks for the number of burgers and fries in the text in row 4.",,
12,Burgers and Fries_ Exploring Equivalent Expressions - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Part 1,,
13,Burgers and Fries_ Exploring Equivalent Expressions - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The first part of the lesson supports students in making connections among the pictorial, verbal, and symbolic representations of the burgers and fries orders. Ask students to match cards containing symbolic representations with the total number of burgers and fries represented pictorially and verbally. To do this, give the students the cards in card set 1 and ask them to place the appropriate card in each row of the column labeled card set 1 on activity sheet 1. Each expression on the cards in card set 1 is of the form xB + yF, where x represents the number of burgers (B) and y represents the number of fries (F). On some cards, a blank line is in place of the number. When we implemented the lesson, students were generally able to find the appropriate matches.",,
14,Burgers and Fries_ Exploring Equivalent Expressions - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Part 2,,
15,Burgers and Fries_ Exploring Equivalent Expressions - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Ask students to think about how to share the burgers and fries order equally among family members and to represent this situation both pictorially and symbolically. To do this, students work with activity sheet 2. The first column in this section contains a duplicate picture of the burgers and fries order; the second column indicates the number of family members. Students are asked to circle the items in the picture that each family member would get if each person received the same meal and if more than one person were in the family. In some cases, the number of family members is provided; in other cases, students are expected to determine and record the appropriate number of family members.",,
16,Burgers and Fries_ Exploring Equivalent Expressions - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In our experience, most students are able to complete this part of the lesson successfully. However, some students may initially try to circle sets of 1 burger and 1 fry for each family member, leaving ungrouped burgers or ungrouped fries (see fig. 2).",,
17,Burgers and Fries_ Exploring Equivalent Expressions - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
18,Burgers and Fries_ Exploring Equivalent Expressions - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,These students are able to correctly group the food when they are reminded that all the food needs to be shared equally.,,
19,Burgers and Fries_ Exploring Equivalent Expressions - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Part 3,,
20,Burgers and Fries_ Exploring Equivalent Expressions - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Next, ask students to consider how to represent the total number of burgers and fries in the order in terms of what each family member receives. For this part, students should be given card set 2 and asked to place these cards in the appropriate row in the column labeled card set 2 on activity sheet 2. Each expression in the card set is of the form",,
21,Burgers and Fries_ Exploring Equivalent Expressions - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,(xB + yF) + (xB + yF) + . . . + (xB + yF).,,
22,Burgers and Fries_ Exploring Equivalent Expressions - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The expression within each parenthetical grouping represents what each family member receives from the full order. The number of parenthetical groupings represents the number of family members. For example, the expression",,
23,Burgers and Fries_ Exploring Equivalent Expressions - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,(3B + F) + (3B + F),,
24,Burgers and Fries_ Exploring Equivalent Expressions - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"indicates that there are two family members, each of whom receives 3 burgers and 1 fry. To support student understanding, encourage students to describe in words what the expressions mean and to associate the elements in the expression with the picture. This activity allows students to see another way to express the items in the order, thus establishing the idea of equivalence between the symbolic expressions from activity 1 and the symbolic expressions in activity 2, with the pictures providing a visual image of why the expressions are equivalent.",,
25,Burgers and Fries_ Exploring Equivalent Expressions - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Part 4,,
26,Burgers and Fries_ Exploring Equivalent Expressions - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In this last part of the lesson, students use a different set of symbolic representations to represent the total number of burgers and fries in the order in terms of what each family member receives. Give students card set 3 and ask them to place these cards in the appropriate row in the column labeled card set 3 on activity sheet 2. The expressions on these cards represent the result of combining the like expressions on the previous cards. For example, the matching card for",,
27,Burgers and Fries_ Exploring Equivalent Expressions - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,(3B + F) + (3B + F) is 2(3B + F).,,
28,Burgers and Fries_ Exploring Equivalent Expressions - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Again, ask students to explain in words what these expressions represent and why they represent the same groupings as the previous set of cards.",,

30,Burgers and Fries_ Exploring Equivalent Expressions - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"To assess student understanding, ask students to write an expression for the number of burgers and fries ordered by a family of 5, in which each family member ordered 2 burgers and 3 fries.

34,Burgers and Fries_ Exploring Equivalent Expressions - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"For a lesson extension, introduce the idea that some orders can be shared equally among different numbers of people and that the possible number of people is determined by common factors between the number of burgers and the number of fries. For example, an order of 18 burgersand 6 fries can be shared equally among 2, 3, and 6 people because 2, 3, and 6 are common factors of 6 and 18. Thus:",,
