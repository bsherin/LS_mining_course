The design of this garden, known as a stacking garden, allows students to apply problem- solving skills as they represent the garden with concrete manipulatives, such as pattern blocks, to explore concepts of measurement and geometry. Calculations of perimeter and area reveal many interesting functional relationships for algebraic thought as students communicate about patterns and connect mathematical ideas to real-life problems.

The gardener chooses to use a regular hexagonal base surrounded by 6 equilateral triangles, with 1 edge of each triangle being adjacent to an edge of the hexagon. The second vertical layer of the stacked garden will consist of raising the hexagon shape in the middle to a higher level, above the level of the equilateral triangles.

To visualize the second vertical layer, students stack two regular hexagons on top of each other at the center of the garden, as shown in figure 2. Some strategies for teaching mathematics to reach all students focus on the use of manipulatives for demonstrating mathematical concepts. “It is important to use concrete objects for hands-on activities; they not only make the comprehension of abstract math concepts easier but also fun” (Furner, Yahya, and Duffy 2005).

The teacher leads a discussion about the need for placing border material between adjacent edges of the first layer in addition to outer edges of the second layer. Students discuss in groups the mathematical application they are being asked to make. After deciding that they are looking for the perimeter of shapes included in each layer of the garden, the teacher leads them into finding the perimeter of one of the equilateral triangles on the bottom layer of the garden. Students are asked to find the measurements of their equilateral triangles to the nearest half centimeter. Some students measure only one side of the equilateral triangle and find it to be 2.5 cm. They then multiply 2.5 cm × 3 to obtain a perimeter of 7.5 cm for the equilateral triangle. Other students measure each individual side of the triangle and add these measurements to obtain the same perimeter of 7.5 cm. Different problem-solving techniques are discussed among class members to help students realize that these approaches lead to the same solution. ",19,mtms2007-09-68a,,

Some students prefer to measure their traced diagram because it is a stationary representation (as seen in fig. 3). Other students choose to measure the actual pattern-block pieces, as shown in figure 4. After group and class discussion, students agree on a strategy: Since they have 18 edges in the bottom layer (see fig. 5) and 6 additional edges in the upper layer, for a total of 24, they multiply 24 by the 2.5 cm for each edge to find the 60 cm of needed border material.",20,mtms2007-09-68a,,

They then apply a strategy to calculate the total area based on a total of 12 equilateral triangles, with each having an area of 2.5 cm2, as illustrated in figure 6. Students calculate the total area of the stacked garden to be 30 cm2.",37,mtms2007-09-68a,,
Extending the stacking garden to individualized layouts,38,mtms2007-09-68a,,
"Students are then encouraged to explore their own creation of a stacking garden with the pattern blocks, as shown in figure 7. Using pattern blocks offers multiple advantages for the students. Four of the pattern blocks (the hexagon, trapezoid, rhombus, and triangle) are uniform in their side lengths, and the larger blocks can be covered by a number of the smaller blocks. For example, the trapezoid pattern block can be recreated using three of the triangle pattern blocks. This relationship between blocks allows students to place   differing shapes adjacent to each other to create a wide variety of gardens. The relationship between blocks also allows for easier calculations and comparisons concerning perimeter and area. Once the students calculate the area of the triangle, they recognize that the area of the trapezoid is three times the area of the triangle or that the area of the rhombus is simply two times the area of the triangle. ",39,mtms2007-09-68a,,
"As various layouts are created,  students trace and color the layouts on their pattern-block graph paper, as shown in figure 8. Pattern-block graph paper allows students to trace shapes easily onto paper, allowing for ease in measurement of side lengths and total perimeter. Students are asked to find the perimeter and the area of their garden and share this information with the class. When the project is completed, the teacher asks students if the size of their individual garden and original stacked garden seem reasonable for planting. A discussion about the use of these models as scaled representations of larger stacked gardens leads into the search for functional relationships with perimeter and area. ",40,mtms2007-09-68a,,
"When students realize that these  paper-and-pencil gardens could become real-life gardens, the teacher quickly turns the focus to the study of similar figures, ratios, and proportional reasoning to find real-life measurements. The teacher asks, “If 1 cm represents 2 ft., what would be the perimeter of the stacked garden in real life?” Because each individual garden differs at this point, the teacher uses the earlier example to demonstrate the use of a scaled ratio and proportional reasoning to solve this problem, which provides an excellent opportunity to × incorporate ratio and proportion for students lacking this skill.",41,mtms2007-09-68a,,

"Students recognize the concept of equivalent fractions to find 120 feet. The teacher then asks, “What is the scale factor when comparing the area of the model to a real-life garden?” Students discuss the difference between a measurement of perimeter and that of area. They decide that perimeter represents a one-dimensional measurement and that area focuses on two dimensions. Since area focuses on two dimensions, the measurement units become squared. Thus, the scale factor of 1 cm = 2 ft. would be squared  base height to produce a new scale factor of  1 cm2 = 4 ft.2 for area. This idea of squaring the scale factor for a onedimensional measurement (such as perimeter) to get the scale factor for a two-dimensional measurement (for area) is often difficult for students to understand. A common misconception is that the scale factor for perimeter would be exactly the same as the scale factor for area.
