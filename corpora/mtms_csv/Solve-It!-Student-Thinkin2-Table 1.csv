9,Solve It! Student Thinking: Factor Groups,"tTwo teachers submitted reflections and  student work for this task. Jenny Salls, who teaches sixth-grade and seventhgrade gifted and talented students, assigned this problem to one class of sixth graders and two classes of seventh graders. These classes worked on the task in twenty-minute sessions across three days. Marianne Madoff, who teaches sixth-grade mathematics, had four classes work on this problem over three class periods. Each teacher presented the task as it originally appeared in MTMS, with little discussion of how to solve it, and they both allowed their students to work in groups. The following discussion highlights similarities and differences in the student thinking in each teacher’s class.  salls’s class",9,Solve It! Student Thinking: Factor Groups
10,Solve It! Student Thinking: Factor Groups,"Many of Salls’s students tried to find the number of factors for each number from 1 to 100. The students split up the set of numbers, often giving the first set of 20 numbers to one group member, the second set of 20 to another group member, and so on. In so doing, each individual worked independently within the group and often had difficulty identifying patterns until the group members compiled all the results and organized them differently. In figure 1, a group of four students had each factored 25 numbers. Then the group compiled its findings in a table that represented the numbers with the same number of factors. Other groups decided to work  together and organize the numbers around the factors that each had found from the beginning (see fig. 2). Although Salls noted that it seemed as if these groups did not make progress as quickly, they were actually the first groups to identify patterns and relationships. ",10,Solve It!

19,Solve It! Student Thinking: Factor Groups,"Salls noted that her sixth graders  had previously studied primes and factors. As a result, many returned to their sieve of Eratosthenes to find the primes, and then used primes and divisibility rules to help determine the number of factors. The sixth graders also explored other possible patterns. One group found, for example, that  6	had	4	factors,	and	that	2	× 6 had   2	+	4	factors;	12	had	6	factors,	and	 2 × 12 had 2 + 6 factors.

Although this pattern did not work, it had the potential to yield some interesting insights, but the students were missing some key notions that might have helped them progress. For example, it may have helped to ask the students to explore the results of multiplying by a new prime (e.g., 5), instead of by 2, which was a prime that was already present in the number.",22,Solve It!

24,Solve It! Student Thinking: Factor Groups,"I really liked this problem—it had lots of entry points so that even my struggling students were able to find some way to get into the problem. There were so many different ways to find relationships that students were genuinely interested in the relationships their peers found, and many students learned new problem-solving strategies ",24,Solve It!

26,Solve It! Student Thinking: Factor Groups,We agree with Salls’s thoughts and  also want to add that learning does not always come from reaching a final solution to a problem but through the thinking and reasoning processes that are developed during the search for relationships. ,26,Solve It!

28,Solve It! Student Thinking: Factor Groups,"In Madoff ’s classrooms, much like Salls’s, the students shared their strategies and findings after the first twenty minutes of working. Their findings were similar to those found by Salls’s students at the end of twenty minutes. They knew that 1 had only 1 factor and that all the primes had 2 factors, but they also noted that “some of the squares	have	3	factors.”	This	discovery quickly led to a discussion about which	of	the	squares	had	3	factors	and	 which did not. Students noted that 16,	36,	64,	81,	and	100	did	not	have	 just	3	factors,	but	4,	9,	25,	and	49	did.	",28,Solve It! Student Thinking: Factor Groups
29,Solve It! Student Thinking: Factor Groups,"With Madoff ’s prompting to  use their algebra skills and exponent knowledge, students chose a 2 to represent the perfect square. By examining the cases that both worked and did not work, students decided that a had  to be prime if the square had only  3	factors.	This	generalization	led	to	a	 discussion of the primes being a1 and having 2 total factors and a0 =	1	having	 only 1 factor. Suddenly, students saw a pattern and made conjectures about  a3	and a4. Eventually, students explored numbers with more than 1 prime factor,	like	6	=	2	×	3.	As	students	worked,	 the groups compiled a chart of all the numbers between 1 and 100, their prime factorizations, and the total number of factors each had. ",29,Solve It!

30,Solve It! Student Thinking: Factor Groups,"For each class period, the groups  shared their thinking twice. This allowed all the groups to reach the following conclusions: •	 an, where a is any prime number,  will have n + 1 total factors.  •	 a1b 1, where a and b represent  different prime numbers, will  have	4	factors.",30,Solve It! Student Thinking: Factor Groups
31,Solve It! Student Thinking: Factor Groups,"Madoff reported this student  discussion:  50	=	2	× 5 × 5, which is a1b 2, so we know	it	has	more	than	4	factors.	It	 has	6	factors.	Let’s	check	3	×	7	×	7,	 it has that same form. Will it also have 6 factors? Can we predict other products that have 6 factors?  The groups created posters to present their findings. Some posters contained only the answers to the questions	posed	in	the	original	task;	others	 illustrated a color-coded hundreds chart. Some went further and looked at the distribution of the numbers  1 to 100 by the number of factors (see fig. 3). One student even added a typed sheet to the poster that showed what happens when the number has more than 2 prime factors (see fig. 4). Madoff expressed her thinking on  the task: ",31,Solve It!

32,Solve It! Student Thinking: Factor Groups,"As we moved through the unit on number theory, . . . the material seemed dry and teacher directed. . . . Exploring factor groups provided the kind of investigation that helped solidify the role of prime numbers for my sixth graders. . . . This kind of exploration easily differentiated the instruction as students conversed, discovered, and planned their findings in organized ways. They wanted to teach others and compare notes. Two months later, my sixth graders easily factored out numbers and discussed the number of factors. ",32,Solve It! Student Thinking: Factor Groups

34,Solve It! Student Thinking: Factor Groups,"Often we find ourselves reading students’ submitted work, wishing that we could have asked additional questions. For example, we might have asked students to specifically explore all numbers between 1 and 100 that had prime factorizations consisting of a single prime raised to a power or to look at all numbers that contained only 2 prime factors. Finally, we might also have asked students to explore the results when a student multiplied a number by a new prime versus a higher exponent on a single prime (of the form px where p is prime). These additional explorations helped Madoff ’s students find their generalizations and may have helped others as well. ",34,Solve It! Student Thinking: Factor Groups
