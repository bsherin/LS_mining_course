Transdisciplinary teaching occurs when content areas are integrated in a seamless way, in which students are “exploring content areas by foregrounding a problem or issue using multiple inquiry processes, which naturally connect the disciplines through the problem to be solved” (Herro and Quigley  2016, p. 2). In other words, instead of prioritizing a specific content area (e.g., mathematics) the problem or issue itself is at the forefront, and knowledge from multiple subject areas are blended to reach a comprehensive solution. In transdisciplinary teaching, students become so engrossed in their learning that they are eager to use previous knowledge and acquire new knowledge from multiple subject areas to arrive at a solution to the problem. ",17,Design Thinking Framework: Shaping Powerful Mathematics
18,Design Thinking Framework: Shaping Powerful Mathematics,"Over the last five years, in a variety of classroom settings, we have worked  to engage students in mathematical learning that uses transdisciplinary teaching to go beyond typical daily lessons and instead absorb students in thought-provoking and authentic real-world contexts. We recently began structuring these real-world investigations using a research-based framework from the Institute of Design at Stanford called the Design Thinking Framework (Institute of Design at Stanford 2016).

27,Design Thinking Framework: Shaping Powerful Mathematics,DESIGNING A PROSTHETIC  FOR A KINDERGARTNER,27,Design Thinking Framework: Shaping Powerful Mathematics
28,Design Thinking Framework: Shaping Powerful Mathematics,"In an intermediate classroom in rural Kentucky, we engaged a class of students in a life-changing project in which they addressed the critical physical need of one small child from a neighboring elementary school. This child was born without a lower arm and hand. When she arrived to kindergarten, it was quickly realized that she needed to be able to press Control+Alt+Delete simultaneously on the keyboard to log in to school computers. A class of students accepted the challenge of designing a prosthetic arm and hand for this kindergartner, ultimately producing it on a 3D printer. The students were motivated by this challenge, which the classroom teachers framed using the Design Thinking Framework (Bush, Cox, and Cook 2016). ",28,Design Thinking Framework: Shaping Powerful Mathematics
29,Design Thinking Framework: Shaping Powerful Mathematics,"We first engaged students in the empathize stage (stage 1) by reviewing the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA 2015) guidelines and had students walk the school grounds with one arm held behind their backs as they tried to perform such common daily tasks as using the sink, opening doors, writing, eating and so on. Students documented areas of concern during this tour. Once back in the classroom, they brainstormed solutions to challenges they faced  during this experiment and were passionate about several findings that revealed issues. They even provided recommendations to the school principal! During this stage, students empathized with the kindergartner and developed a passion for wanting to help design a prosthetic for her. This proved to be the most powerful example of the empathize stage we have ever witnessed. Next, we wanted to work with students to clearly define the problem. After we organized students into design teams of four-to-five students, we asked them to research background information on skeletal systems, prosthetics, the measurements of the arm, angles, and inventions. Next, through identifying must-have parameters for the prosthetic, such as that it needed to be able to allow the kindergartner to press Control+Alt+Delete successfully, students were able to define (stage 2) the problem they needed to solve. Students worked cyclically within  the ideate, prototype, and test stages (stages 3, 4 and 5), which is where the intentional use of mathematics was crucial to the solution of this problem. Students worked within the ideate stage as they brainstormed  possible designs, researched  background information, created a group design based on measurements, and constructed blueprints using  mathematical tools. It took time for some students to be able to visualize how tiny the kindergartner’s arm was, and some students even went home and measured the hands and arms of their younger siblings to gain a better perspective to inform their work in the ideate stage. In the prototype stage, students built a prototype under budget constraints, evaluated prototypes using rubrics, received critiques from stakeholders and peers, and determined what features would be included in the final class design. Students were given a group budget of $25.00 and shopped for items using a local home improvement store’s website. Finally, in the test stage, students made a presentation to stakeholders and classmates to justify and advocate their case for their designs, which aligned closely to the CCSSM mathematical practice “Construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others” (CCSSI 2010, p. 6). The test stage also included the physical testing of the final prototypes. As you can see, students worked iteratively through these three stages as they formulated ideas, designed, created, and tested. They then went back to gather more ideas from research and peers, to redesign and recreate, then retest. It was critical to focus on both the mathematics and the stages of the Design Thinking Framework. As mentioned, the mathematics really came to the forefront during the iterative cycle involving the ideate, prototype, and test stages. During this time, students were given budget constraints and had to think critically about their must-have materials and the quantities of those supplies.

This aligns to the CCSSM content standard 6.NS.3, fluently add, subtract, multiply, and divide multidigit decimals using the standard algorithm for each operation (CCSSI 2010, p. 42). ",31,Design Thinking Framework: Shaping Powerful Mathematics
32,Design Thinking Framework: Shaping Powerful Mathematics,"During this time, students also used length measurement and measurement conversion as they worked to estimate how long and how wide the prosthetic arm should be, starting with inches and eventually converting to millimeters. Using inches made more sense to students because they were more familiar with this measurement. When they converted to millimeters, it was strange to students that the “numbers got so big,” so we had to reinforce the idea that there are more millimeter units because each individual unit represents less length. ",32,Design Thinking Framework: Shaping Powerful Mathematics
33,Design Thinking Framework: Shaping Powerful Mathematics,"We continually referred back to  measurement tools to provide a visual representation. Using millimeter units, students worked within Tinkercad™ (Roskes and 3d Vinci 2015) design software to create a technological blueprint of their idea to be printed on a 3D-printer (see fig. 2). Once students were fully engrossed in creating the technological blueprint of the prosthetic, they began to realize why using a more precise measurement unit (millimeters rather than inches) was important because this enabled students to build the blueprint with more precise dimensions. Finally, students found that they had to create a prototype that fit the kindergartner and that it had to be functional, which in this case meant that it needed to be sturdy enough that the kindergartner could press Control+Alt+Delete with enough pressure to log in to the computer. ",33,Design Thinking Framework: Shaping Powerful Mathematics
34,Design Thinking Framework: Shaping Powerful Mathematics,Students used old keyboards as a realistic test site to conduct trial runs of multiple iterations of their prototypes. They also used a protractor to consider the angle measure needed where the prosthetic arm connects to the hand (acting as a wrist) so that the fingers would easily touch the keyboard when the kindergartner was situated in her normal position in front of the computer. It was interesting to watch students try to position the protractor in a way that made sense against the keyboard as they considered the angle measurement. Keeping the mathematics tightly woven into the stages of the Design Thinking Framework was part of what made solving this authentic problem in their home community both of great significance to students but also high leverage in terms of engaging students with key mathematics content. All students in this class were intensely passionate about helping the local kindergartner—they were highly engaged in the problem and in their mathematical learning— which is truly momentous. ,34,Design Thinking Framework: Shaping Powerful Mathematics

36,Design Thinking Framework: Shaping Powerful Mathematics,"As we used the Design Thinking Framework, we kept track of our lessons learned and provide the following as a list of helpful hints for implementation in your classroom: 1.  Empathy does not always come  naturally for adolescents. As teachers, we must think through how we can guide each of our  students to think about themselves in someone else’s shoes.  You might need to be more explicit about this stage than you initially think.",36,Design Thinking Framework: Shaping Powerful Mathematics
37,Design Thinking Framework: Shaping Powerful Mathematics,"2.  The Design Thinking Framework requires us to teach in a very openended way. There are multiple  entry points to the problem, and knowledge from multiple content areas is often needed to find a viable solution. This requires flexibility; you might be approached with a question you had not anticipated or find yourself needing knowledge from another content area that traditionally has not been required of a middle school mathematics teacher. You likely will not know the answer to everything— rather, this is the perfect opportunity to model lifelong learning as an adult and embrace learning alongside your students.",37,Design Thinking Framework: Shaping Powerful Mathematics
38,Design Thinking Framework: Shaping Powerful Mathematics,"3.  Anticipate the resources that students might need during the ideate stage. This will vary depending on the problem or issue posed, but may necessitate that you are  creative or borrow items from other teachers.  4.  The prototype stage is messy and chaotic. Provide a structure and routines for your classroom and embrace this stage as you circulate your classroom and listen to students working together towards a meaningful and specific goal.

40,Design Thinking Framework: Shaping Powerful Mathematics,"The benefits of using the Design Thinking Framework greatly outweigh the time involved in planning. After reading this article, as you go back to your classroom with the Design Thinking Framework, we hope that you will consider how framing authentic problems in this way can be powerful and a real game changer in your unique classroom setting. The passion that students develop during the empathize stage (stage 1), which hooks them for the duration of the problem, is worth the short time it takes to facilitate the discussion that builds empathy within each child. ",40,Design Thinking Framework: Shaping Powerful Mathematics
41,Design Thinking Framework: Shaping Powerful Mathematics,"The ideate, prototype, and test  stages (stages 3, 4, and 5) help prepare students for college and the workplace in ways that traditional lessons usually do not. To be successful in these stages, students must work collaboratively with one another, persevere even when they reach multiple failure points, and think critically as they brainstorm, build, and test—only to complete that cycle over and over again to refine their solution. Many authentic problems that you could pose in the mathematics classroom are bound to have strong connections to other disciplines, which is why we advocate for a true transdisciplinary teaching approach. Cohesively combining multiple subject areas, in our cases STEAM, can generate meaningful solutions. We are hopeful that this article piques your interest and challenges you to try the Design Thinking Framework. ",41,Design Thinking Framework: Shaping Powerful Mathematics
