"T he ancient Mayan systeM of nuMeration is quite sophisticated, yet the basics are beautifully simple. it is an appealing system to teach to students of almost any age. Mayan numerals are composed of only three symbols, but with the power of place value and a symbol for zero, large numbers can be concisely written. With their interest in astronomy and the passage of time, the Maya (located in what is now central america and southern Mexico) developed accurate calendars using this numeration system. Mayan merchants often used cacao beans in making computations to keep track of their business transactions (closs 1986).",3,mtms2007-02-340a,,

"bar   for 5, and a shell  the numerals • (1) through  (19) are writ-  ten in the first place-value position. since the Maya used a base-twenty system, the number 20  is written with a dot in the vertical second place-value position and a shell (zero) as a placeholder in the first place-value position. thus,  represents 7, whereas  shannon overbay, overbay@gonzaga.edu, is an assistant professor of mathematics at Gonzaga University, Spokane, WA  99258.

"Activity 4 merge two fascinating mathematical topics: the Mayan system of numeration and magic squares. students  tend  to  love  solving  puzzles  and  are  easily motivated by these activities. in particular, magic squares have been enjoyed by a variety of cultures throughout the ages (anderson 2001). While using their problem-solving skills, students are introduced to the numeration system of the ancient culture of the Maya. these activities have been very popular with native  american  middle  school  students  in  sMiLe (science and Mathematics interactive Learning experience) summer camps. the exercises work well when done individually or in a group setting.",8,mtms2007-02-340a,,
Activity 1: Mayan Numerals,9,mtms2007-02-340a,,
"Activity  1 acquaints students with the basic notation of Mayan numerals. students can work in small groups to help each other become familiar with the numeration  system.  one  way  to  start  is  by  counting using Mayan numerals. (Fig. 1 is a student example of counting up to 50.) this can be completed with pencil and paper or manipulatives. shells (real shells or uncooked macaroni) can be used for the 0 placeholder; ﬂ at toothpicks or craft sticks can be used for 5; anything small and round (such as candy or pennies) can be used for 1. first, students should ",10,mtms2007-02-340a,,

Problem 2 gives some historical information on the Mayan solar calendar and provides students the opportunity to think about why a system based on 5 and 20 would be a natural system.,12,mtms2007-02-340a,,
Activity 3: Mayan Magic Squares (3 × 3),13,mtms2007-02-340a,,
"Activity  3  introduces  the  properties  of  a  magic square by verifying the sums in all rows, columns, and diagonals. this is a continuation of the addition from  the  previous  activity.  after  completing  problem 1, students should understand the definition of a magic square.",14,mtms2007-02-340a,,
"in problem 2, students actually begin to complete the magic squares. this should help them develop logical  thinking  skills.  Problem  3  is  an  extension of the traditional 3 × 3 magic square where Mayan numbers for 3 through 11 are used. (see fig. 3 for student work.) ",15,mtms2007-02-340a,,
Activity 4: Mayan Magic Squares (4 × 4),16,mtms2007-02-340a,,
"Activity 4 provides more challenging problems. if completed in a group setting, students can think out loud and share problem-solving strategies with one another. they may also verify their work to determine if all the conditions for a magic square are met. Problem 3 causes students to think about the effect on each sum in the magic square when each entry has been increased by 2.  learn to exchange 5  dots for a bar and to count up through 19. then students can be introduced to the use of the Mayan symbol for 0 when writing 20. this reinforces  the  concept  of  place  value  and  the  importance of a symbol for 0 used in our conventional hindu-arabic decimal system (nctM 2000).  after  learning  to  count  with  Mayan  numerals, students  practice  converting  Mayan  numerals  to standard decimal notation. if work is done in groups, each  member  can  take  turns  writing  a  Mayan  numeral while the rest of the group converts it to standard  notation.  next,  students  translate  numbers from standard notation to Mayan numerals. at this stage, it is recommended that the numbers used are less  than  360,  since  the  third  place-value  position is a 360 (rather than 400) in Mayan solar calendar mathematics. Working with larger numbers can be done later as an extension exercise.",17,mtms2007-02-340a,,
Activity 2: Working with Mayan Numerals,18,mtms2007-02-340a,,
"Activity 2 focuses on the operation of addition using Mayan numerals, which prepares students for working with magic squares. a possible supplemental activity would be to create addition tables with Mayan numerals. (see fig. 2.) students may need to be reminded that no more than 4  dots or 3 bars are to be used in a level. a possible group activity would be to write down the ages of all members of a group and then find the sum of the ages using Mayan numerals. students can also make up their own addition problems.",19,mtms2007-02-340a,,
"With a little practice, each student should be able to complete the addition in problem 1. finding the missing  addends  not  only  prepares  them  for  completing  the  magic  squares  but  gives  them  a  good background  for  algebra,  since  they  must  find  the unknown quantity in each equation (nctM 2000).

"Discussion these  activities  Work  WeLL  in  a  suMMer  camp setting or can be used in the classroom during the school year. the material is new to most students, so groups of varying ages and diverse mathematics backgrounds  can  work  together,  starting  with  the basics.  the  beginning  activities  can  be  done  with manipulatives. younger, less mathematically experienced students can count in Mayan, do simple addition problems (learning to exchange 5 dots for 1 bar), and complete some of the beginning magic squares. Many  students  will  even  find  it  easier  mentally  to check  the  sums  of  a  3 ×  3  magic  square  in  Mayan than in conventional hindu-arabic notation.",23,mtms2007-02-340a,,
"those who want more challenging problems will move on quickly to the more difficult magic squares and work with numbers greater than 19. While having fun with the puzzle-solving aspect of completing the magic squares, students can master a different numeration system. they can see the importance of using 0 as a placeholder and appreciate the genius of the Maya who devised the system long ago.

"Extensions dePendinG  on  the  aGes  and  MatheMatics  levels of the students, natural extensions of the activities  presented  may  be  explored.  for  example, must the 5 always be in the middle of a 3 × 3 magic square? Why? how does one create a 4 × 4 magic square? is there a 4 × 4 magic square that is different from those found in the activity sheets? if we add the same number to every entry of a magic square, is the result also a magic square? if so, how do the sums change? are there 5 × 5 magic squares? how are  Mayan  numerals  360  or  greater  written?  What goes in the third place-value level? Was there more than one Mayan calendar? there are many possibilities, including integrating Mayan mathematics with a study of the culture of the Maya people.
