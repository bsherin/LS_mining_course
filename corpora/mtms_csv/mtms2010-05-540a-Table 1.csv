"Scenarios of students using manipulatives to explore and justify mathematical ideas  show how they are poised to generate  aA math classroom is complex. Teachers navigate through a lesson using a variety of activities and tools that are designed to address students’ needs and help them build conceptual understanding. Manipulatives, drawings, and other such concrete representations can help students explore mathematical ideas in physically grounded manifestations (Dienes 1961; Sowell 1989). ",3,mtms2010-05-540a,,
"Manipulatives can also be used to help generate remarkable change over time in students’ justifications (Maher and Martino 1996), but little is known about how explorations with manipulatives can influence their justifications. The use of manipulatives in mathematics instruction does not guarantee meaningful learning outcomes (Clements and McMillan 1996). That said, aligning various components of a lesson, including explorations with manipulatives, to support students’ justifying and proving is important.",4,mtms2010-05-540a,,
If we think of the proving process  as— effective proofs.,5,mtms2010-05-540a,,
"1.  articulating a conjecture to be  justified; 2.  developing or selecting a logical sequencing of general statements accepted to be true; 3.  using valid representational forms,  such as verbal statements or  pictures;  4.  and exercising modes of argumentation that are accepted by the classroom community (see Stylianides 2007a),  then instruction should provide students with opportunities to follow this process. ",6,mtms2010-05-540a,,
"The focus here will be on presenting and discussing actual classroom scenarios of students who are using manipulatives to explore and justify mathematical ideas. The importance of aligning all aspects of proof-related instruction, from pattern generalization to conjecture validation, will be highlighted to show that students can be prepared to generate justifications that are based on general statements.

MisalignMent of exPloration and discussion,8,mtms2010-05-540a,,
"This analysis of an actual classroom lesson illustrates how a misalignment between the exploration and conjecturing phase and the formal justification phase affects the justifications that students produce, specifically, when the exploration involves  manipulatives. The lesson, Investigation 3.3 from the Connected Mathematics Project unit called Prime Time, was observed in a sixth-grade classroom taught by Ms. Jordan (all names have been changed to genderappropriate pseudonyms). ",9,mtms2010-05-540a,,
"Students manipulated tile models of numbers to represent factorizations in previous investigations from Prime Time (e.g., factoring twelve by constructing suitable area models). In this investigation, students explore definitions of odd and even numbers and generate conjectures and results when adding or multiplying odd and even numbers. Although these conjectures can be summarily proven using  algebraic manipulation, sixth graders tend to employ more verbal and visual arguments, given that they are less fluent in representing numerical relationships algebraically. ",10,mtms2010-05-540a,,
"After a student read the introductory material (see fig. 1) out loud, Ms. Jordan asked the class to describe the conjecture in their own words as they were starting to evaluate the parity of the numbers described by the various statements shown in figure 2. One student offered that a conjecture is like “a hypothesis,” and Ms. Jordan added that conjectures are “a logical guess based on some facts.” The groups were instructed to discuss the patterns they noticed in the models, as well as how they would build 50 and 99 with the models.",11,mtms2010-05-540a,,
"After two minutes of working in  groups, whole-class discussion resumed, with Ms. Jordan summarizing what she heard:",12,mtms2010-05-540a,,
"So, when I was going around to the groups, what I heard was that the odds have a block hanging off. Some of you came up with the rule that all of the even ones have to be squares like 4 is, or they have to be at least these nice, neat rectangles like 2 and 6 are.",13,mtms2010-05-540a,,
"In the launch of the problem, ",14,mtms2010-05-540a,,
"Ms. Jordan summarized the emerging definitions of an odd number as a tile model with a block “hanging off ” and an even number as either a square, as 4 is modeled, or a “nice, neat” rectangle. Valid definitions for odd and even numbers are necessary for constructing valid justifications for the sum and product of odd and even numbers. The exploratory phase at the beginning of the lesson, modeled using manipulatives, helps students develop these definitions. However, no link was made between these physical features and the mathematical feature that the length  fig. 1 this introductory information provided the basis for students to generate proofs involving odd and even numbers.",15,mtms2010-05-540a,,
Problem 3.3: Reasoning with Odd and Even Numbers,16,mtms2010-05-540a,,
"An even number is a number that has 2 as a factor. An odd number is a number that does not have 2 as a factor. in this problem, you will study patterns involving odd and even numbers. First, you will learn a way of modeling odd and even numbers. then, you will make conjectures about the sums and products of odd and even numbers. A conjecture is your best guess about a relationship. you can use the models to justify, or prove, your conjectures.",17,mtms2010-05-540a,,
"Will’s friend, Jocelyn, makes models for whole numbers by arranging  square tiles in a special pattern. here are Jocelyn’s tile models for the numbers from 1 to 7: discuss with your class how the models for even numbers are different from the models for odd numbers. then describe the models for 50 and 99.",18,mtms2010-05-540a,,

"This thought process was intentionally not explored so that students would not conclude that 9 is an even  number because it can also be represented by a square. Thus, general statements about odd and even numbers were not established in the launch of the lesson. Students did not proceed into the formal argumentation phase of the lesson with the appropriate tools to construct justifications based on general statements.",27,mtms2010-05-540a,,
"After a brief discussion about how  odd and even numbers are represented by the models, Ms. Jordan offered specific instructions for Problem 3.3. She articulated that the students’ conjectures must be supported by facts, that examples are not enough, and that a proof is more than some models or examples. ",28,mtms2010-05-540a,,
"In this excerpt, students are told that they should use tile models to develop their justifications. However, no discussion or modeling occurred regarding how tile models could be used in an argument. Research has shown that undergraduate mathematics majors struggle to construct proofs about elementary number theory ideas (Stylianou and Blanton 2002). It is reasonable to expect that middle school students would need the use of tile models to be scaffolded by the teacher to ensure that students understand how the tiles were to be used in justifications.",29,mtms2010-05-540a,,
"The lesson activity was implemented over two class periods. Students had thirty-eight minutes to complete parts A–F of Problem 3.3. At the end of the second class period, Ms. Jordan brought the class together to discuss their conjectures. In this dialogue, Kelly is sharing her response for the prompt about the product of two even numbers:",30,mtms2010-05-540a,,
"Kelly: The product of two even numbers is always going to be even [see fig. 3]. When you are making a model, it is kind of like adding it together, because you can’t multiply a model on paper. So I did 4 + 4 + 4 + 4, which is 4 × 4, which is 16, because you are adding an even number an even amount of times, so it is always going to be even.",31,mtms2010-05-540a,,

"This vignette will illustrate the importance of coordinating all aspects of teaching to help students develop mathematically correct and sufficiently general justifications. This classroom episode explores Mrs. Conroy’s eighth-grade class working on a visual proof of the Pythagorean theorem (Lappan et al. 2002). Although the class has generalized the pattern between the sums of the squares of the side lengths of a right triangle in the previous day’s lesson, the goal of Investigation 3.2 is to  that addition and multiplication are the same thing. She’s saying that 4 × 4 is the same thing as saying 4 + 4 + 4 + 4. ",36,mtms2010-05-540a,,
"Ms. Jordan moved to the next  problem, accepting this justification as valid even though it stopped short of an appropriate representation. To show that 4 times 4 is even with the tile models, Kelly needed to “push” together the four 2 × 2 square models to make a large 2 × 8 rectangle with 16 tiles. Further, her tile model does not show that she used the facts that the product could be decomposed into a sequence of repeated additions and that the sum of two even numbers is even. ",37,mtms2010-05-540a,,
"Three events in this classroom  episode illustrate a misalignment of the various aspects of the lesson: 1.  The accepted, valid statements regarding the definitions of odd and even numbers were not constructed following the exploratory phase that used the tile models.  2.  Although the teacher told students that their arguments should contain language referencing the tile models, examples were not provided of how to construct arguments in this manner. Because valid definitions for odd and even numbers in terms of the tile models had not been established, students were unable to act on the teacher’s suggestions.  3.  In the formal justification phase, the teacher drew attention to the mathematical fact that multipli- fig. 4 Using these shapes, students are asked to verify the validity of the pythagorean theorem.",38,mtms2010-05-540a,,
"fig. 5 the two figures (a) and (b) used together provide a visual verification of the pythagorean theorem; either figure, individually, would not be sufficient.  (a) Becky’s puzzle  (b) Jessica’s puzzle justify why this pattern would be true for any right triangle.",39,mtms2010-05-540a,,
"The investigation becomes a proof  of the Pythagorean theorem in the context of constructing puzzles from two frames. The pieces of the puzzle are three squares, with the squares having side lengths a, b, and c (see fig. 4). Students are also given eight right triangles, each with side lengths a, b, c. The two frames are identical squares with side lengths of a + b. Students discuss how the side  lengths of the squares compare with the side lengths of the triangles. After identifying the relationships between the side lengths of the squares and triangles, students arrange the pieces to fit exactly into the two puzzle frames. Students are then asked to think about the relationships between the areas of the three square puzzle pieces,  as well as the relationships between the side lengths of the triangles.",40,mtms2010-05-540a,,
"During the launch of the investigation, Ms. Conroy made explicit connections between the prior day’s lesson and this day’s investigation of the Pythagorean theorem. She prompted the students by asking, “How do the side lengths of the squares compare to the lengths of the triangles?” When they were able to connect this answer to the Pythagorean theorem, she asked them why. This dialogue ensued: ",41,mtms2010-05-540a,,
Becky: Two triangles put together look  like the medium-sized square.,42,mtms2010-05-540a,,
Ms. Conroy: What can you tell me about these two squares? [She holds up plastic pieces representing squares with side lengths a and b and pauses.] Or something you  learned yesterday that you filled in your chart?,43,mtms2010-05-540a,,
"Jessica: The two squares have to add up to be the hypotenuse squared. Ms. Conroy: OK, have you all written out some kind of statement about the triangles and squares? You’ve got to prove this somehow, but I don’t know how you are going to do it without cutting them out. I want you to arrange them somehow to fit exactly into the two frames.",44,mtms2010-05-540a,,
"The students worked for seventeen minutes cutting out the puzzle pieces and answering parts of the problem. The teacher canvassed the room as students worked, observing and keeping them on task. To launch the discussion, Becky and Jessica were called to the overhead projector to demonstrate how to fill in the puzzle frames with plastic right-triangle manipulatives (see fig. 5).",45,mtms2010-05-540a,,
"During the lesson, Ms. Conroy did not show students how to arrange the puzzle pieces in the frames. As lesson discussion began, before Ms. Conroy called for a whole-group discussion, a student blurted out a question, which resulted in the dialogue in figure 6. ",46,mtms2010-05-540a,,
"As Becky deftly points out in response to Kyle’s question, her completed puzzle, considered on its own, does not provide a proof of the Pythagorean theorem. Becky’s statement, “I just proved that the sides are the same length because you can put them into a square with each other,” is correct because her puzzle shows that the sum of the side lengths a and b from the small and medium squares is equal to the sum of the lengths of the legs of the right triangles. Becky’s work connects back to Ms. Conroy’s initial question in the lesson introduction: “How do the side lengths of the squares compare to the lengths of the triangles?” However, Becky’s puzzle neither speaks to the relationship between  the hypotenuse of the triangle and the side length of the largest square nor to how the areas of the two smaller squares add to make up the area of the largest square. ",47,mtms2010-05-540a,,
"Again, as identified by Jessica in  the lesson introduction, this was to be a key ingredient in the proof. Becky’s and Jessica’s puzzles provide a complete justification, as Becky explained in figure 6. Although Ms. Conroy did not lead discussion of how the puzzles showed a proof of the Pythagorean theorem, she made several points that helped align phases of the lesson to support students’ justifications: 1.  She asked questions during the launch that encouraged students to compare and contrast features of the squares and right triangles, as well as connect the relationships they noticed between the squares  and triangles as established in the previous day’s investigation.  2.  She drew attention to the importance of this relationship by requesting that all students write down these established statements, which could later be used to construct arguments to justify the Pythagorean theorem.  3.  She reminded students about the need to prove the theorem as the class was discussing how the completed puzzles constituted a proof. ",48,mtms2010-05-540a,,
"By having students walk up to the overhead projector and point to the manipulatives as they explain, she helped them make connections between the visual aspect of the manipulatives and the verbal explanation that Becky provided. Ms. Conroy’s absence in the deliberations about whether or not the completed puzzles represented  a proof allowed students to negotiate what forms of argumentation and argument representation counted as proof of the theorem.  conclusion",49,mtms2010-05-540a,,

However, it may not have been realized because of a competing content-related goal of reviewing relationships between sums and products. The goal of justification in the second vignette was much more explicit in the written curriculum than in the first vignette, which may account for how all phases of the second enacted lesson seemed to contribute to this goal. Taken together, the vignettes suggest that for proof-related activities to support the development of skills in general argumentation, all aspects of the lesson, including exploration with manipulatives, must be  designed and enacted to help students acquire the tools they need to engage in the proving process.
