"M aNY  mOVIES  INcLUDE  a  ScENE  Or  two  containing  mathematics  content  to achieve various effects, such as to show the importance of education, to emphasize  a  point  the  fi lmmaker  wants  to  clarify,  and  to add  humor.  many  of  us  have  been  dazzled  by  the complexity of mathematics in A Beautiful Mind and Good Will Hunting. I know the level of mathematics is beyond the middle school years, but the passion for the subject matter might inspire some students. In  Rain  Man,  Dustin  hoffman  plays  the  autistic brother of Tom cruise and proves that he can calculate square roots and do complex decimal computations  in  his  head.  These  scenes  hint  at  the  importance of mental-math skills, a concept that we need to  emphasize  in  the  middle  grades.  It  also  shows that calculations can be done accurately and rapidly, even when the person doing the calculation has no  carOL IUZZOLINO, CIUZZ@aol.com, teaches seventh-  and  eighth-grade  mathematics  and is head of the mathematics department at the Moriah School of Englewood, NJ 07631.

"I am well aware of our educational time constraints dealing with curriculum that must be taught while trying to infuse new and exciting ideas. I do not suggest sacrifi cing weeks of time to show entire movies. however, I have shown many of the following clips as introductions to the specifi c topics. One year, I had compiled these clips to show during a Family Film Night, making it clear to parents that some content of the movies is inappropriate for seventh and eighth graders but that the specifi c clips were relevant.

"I began my fi lm series with The Mirror Has Two Faces.  The  opening  scene  showing  the  bored  faces of  students  in  a  mathematics  class  will  surely  elicit smiles  from  your  students.  The  passion  with  which the professor speaks about his mathematical formulations can set the tone for your lesson. Later on, he also talks about the infi nite number of prime pairs only two numbers apart. This is a good introduction to number theory, although I much prefer how it is treated in Contact, in which a radio astronomer recognizes symbols received from outer space as a sequence of primes. The character played by Jodie Foster defi nes prime numbers beautifully and explains the universality of numbers and mathematics. I showed this ten-minute  segment as an introduction to number theory in seventh grade, followed by a visit to www.jamesbrennan.",5,mtms2007-03-356a,,

"When you begin geometry in the seventh grade, you  may  want  to  include  the  brief  scene  from  the movie Cast Away, in which Tom hanks is marooned on an uninhabited Pacific Island. In one scene, he computes  the  size  of  the  area  that  rescuers  must search, assuming that the area is a circle centered at the point of the last radio contact. he also assumes that the cargo jet is traveling at 400 mph. he recalls that A = pr2 and continues to calculate A = (400)2p = 160,000p, so 160,000 × 3.14 is approximately 502,400 square miles. he bemoans the fact that this is roughly twice the size of Texas and that he may never be found.  This  clip  can  lead  to  meaningful  geometry lessons  including  comparisons  between  square acreage of states and even countries. I have incorporated graphing the results and included spreadsheet lessons as well.  as  you  move  into  studying  word  problems  in eighth  grade,  a  scene  in  Little  Big  League  would be appropriate to show. It is a movie about a young boy who inherits a baseball team and must juggle his schoolwork with team management. In one brief but humorous scene, he needs to solve a homework question:  Billy  can  paint  a  house  in  5  hours,  and mary can paint it in 3 hours. how many hours did it take both to paint the house? The illogical conclusions his teammates reached can provide meaningful classroom discussions.  another movie with an obvious mathematics theme is Little Man Tate, the story of an exceptional boy who is taken under the wing of an educational guru who introduces him to other brilliant young people. The questions he is asked in competition will surely spark interest in your more competitive students. I have distributed the questions in advance for extra credit and have had students wait to check their answers after seeing the clip. The questions include these:  1.  how many minutes are in 48 years? 2.  how many factors does 3,067 have? 3.  What number, when divided by the product of its digits, has a quotient of 3? If 18 is added to the number, would the digits be inverted? 4.  What is the cube root of 3,796,466? 5.  What  is  the  number  whose  cube,  added  to  five times its square, subtracted by the sum of 40 and 42 times the number is zero? ",7,mtms2007-03-356a,,
"Stand and Deliver is an inspirational movie about inner-city students who beat the odds and learn calculus.  many  scenes  will  engage  students,  but  they will chuckle when they see the teacher using theatrics to convey the concept of percent. he also shows  the wonderful “finger trick” for the times table for 9. When  you  are  ready  for  the  Pythagorean  theorem, pop in the Wizard of Oz. When the scarecrow finally gets a brain, he pronounces, “The sum of the square roots of any two sides of an isosceles triangle is equal to the square root of the remaining sides.” This  statement  can  lead  into  a  lesson  on  squares, square roots, and different kinds of triangles.",8,mtms2007-03-356a,,
"In  Die  Hard:  With  a  Vengeance,  the  heroes  are at the bidding of an evil terrorist. This movie in its One year, I compiled various clips for a Family Film Night, making it clear to parents that some content of the movies is inappropriate for seventh and eighth graders but that the  specific clips were relevant entirety  would  not  be  appropriate  for  eighth  graders. however, the classic problem will engage them. The heroes are challenged to complete a number of tasks quickly to prevent the detonation of a bomb. In one scene, they must make exactly four gallons of a liquid using only five- and three-gallon jugs. I have given  students  time  to  work  in  groups  to  find  the solution before revealing the answer.    If  you  have  access  to  the  abbott  and  costello classic In the Navy, your students will surely chuckle when they see how Lou makes 28 donuts instead of the 7 batches of 13 donuts that he needs. his claim that 7 × 13 = 28 is explained in three ways:  1.  he shows a typical division model but divides 7 into 8 first. Then he subtracts 7 from 8 and brings down the 2 next to the 1 and divides again to get 13.

"Last but not least, Donald in Mathmagic Land is a Disney classic from the 1950s. It can be shown in its entirety. The correlations between mathematics and music, in addition to being wonderful, can show students the creativity inherent in the subject. Donald’s simple descriptions of the golden ratio and Fibonacci numbers can lead into many related topics.",28,mtms2007-03-356a,,
