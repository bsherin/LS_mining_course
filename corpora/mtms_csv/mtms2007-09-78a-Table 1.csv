Implementation of the NCTM’s Curriculum Focal Points: Concept versus Content,0,mtms2007-09-78a,,
"Jane F. Schielack  and Cathy Seeley  oOn September 12, 2006, the NCTM  released a new lens through which to view the content presented in Principles and Standards for School Mathematics (NCTM 2000). In Principles and Standards, the Curriculum Principle calls for a mathematics curriculum to be coherent, focused on important mathematics, and well articulated across the grades. This means that an effective curriculum “gives teachers guidance regarding important ideas or major themes, which receive special attention at different points in time. It also gives guidance about the depth of study warranted at particular times and when closure is expected for particular skills or concepts” (NCTM 2000,  p. 16). With the publication of Curriculum Focal Points for Prekindergarten through Grade 8 Mathematics: A Quest for Coherence, NCTM has taken a ",1,mtms2007-09-78a,,

"Curriculum Focal Points can be  viewed from two perspectives: the concept of a focal point and the actual content delineated within the focal points at particular grade levels. From the concept perspective, the Focal Points present a way to think about how curriculum is organized and presented, regardless of the grade-level placement of topics. From the content perspective, the Focal Points identify particular content for specific grade levels that then link across grade levels but that may or may not directly match a state’s or district’s existing mathematics curriculum. Each of these perspectives can be useful in the development and refinement of curriculum and instruction.  the concept of curriculuM focal points",3,mtms2007-09-78a,,
"Many state, provincial, and school district curriculum documents have  evolved into lists of specific skills that are designed to be used more for assessment than instruction. A mathematics curriculum organized around focal points—that is, a focused curriculum—highlights the most important mathematical ideas for each grade and presents these key ideas as interconnected packages of related concepts, skills, and procedures. A mathematical topic, such as area measure, may begin in the background of a particular grade as a context for exploration, then emerge into the foreground at a later grade for in-depth instruction, and then recede into the background again. Using the Focal Points model, such a topic might appear in the Connections section in one grade, then as a Focal Point in the next grade. Since the Curriculum Focal Points target the most prominent topics for each grade, this same important topic might not be evident in the focal points description at the next grade level because it has become a context for problem solving.",4,mtms2007-09-78a,,
"Curriculum Focal Points represents  the next generation of curriculum documents. The mathematical content is presented in a way that will help teachers better manage their instructional time to support the development  of deep understanding of key ideas that grow and connect over time. Although it is tempting to begin a review of an existing mathematics curriculum by matching content to their locations in Curriculum Focal Points, the concept of a focused curriculum is more than that. It involves highlighting a continuum of key ideas across grades and identifying particular grade levels where the emphasis of instruction will be placed for each of these key ideas. The advantage of such an organizational structure is that teachers, material developers, test developers, administrators, and the public can get a clearer and more accurate sense of what will be happening in a teacher’s mathematics classroom this year than if presented with a long, unprioritized list of topics or textbook chapters. Knowing where the emphasis will be placed and what the most important outcomes should be can help all these individuals support students in learning the critical foundation of mathematics knowledge and skills for the year.",5,mtms2007-09-78a,,
"To promote the use of Curriculum Focal Points to implement a focused curriculum, consider the following questions: •	 What key ideas are reflected in  our existing mathematics curriculum? Are there any key ideas in NCTM’s set of focal points that do not appear somewhere in our curriculum, or vice versa? If so, how do we address that deficiency? •	 Does our sequence of key ideas  make sense mathematically? Does it build developmentally from grade to grade without unnecessary repetition? If not, what needs to be changed to make the key ideas flow from grade to grade?  •	 Can we determine from our curriculum where to place the emphasis at each grade? Can we tell how a topic (like fraction operations)  should be treated differently at grades 5, 6, 7, and 8 to help the student learn for long-term retention without repetition each year? •	 When do we expect the most focused instruction on a particular key idea to occur? Is there an appropriate amount of time for instruction in relation to the whole set of key ideas at that time? If not, how can the key ideas be shifted in a coordinated way to provide for that time? •	 Can we follow the development  of important concepts as they move through the grades from background to foreground to background? Does that movement make sense?  the content of CurriCulum FoCal Points",6,mtms2007-09-78a,,
"As mentioned in the previous section, the actual Focal Point statements for each grade level can be used to help guide thinking about ways to refine existing mathematics curricula. Beyond simply looking at which grade-levelspecific topics might appear in the document, the following specific content components of Curriculum Focal Points suggest guidelines for designing and implementing a focused curriculum: •	 Many of NCTM’s focal points in grades 5–8 are labeled with combinations of content strands, e.g., “Measurement and Geometry and Algebra: Developing an understanding of and using formulas to determine surface areas and volumes of three-dimensional shapes” (p. 19).  •	 The paragraphs explaining the Focal Points highlight the depth of the ideas and give a sense of the range of knowledge, skills, contexts, and problems that might accompany the development of the Focal Point.",7,mtms2007-09-78a,,
"•	 The topics listed in the sections  labeled “Connections to the Focal Points” provide meaningful contexts, identify connections between  strands and across grade levels, and round out a well-balanced curriculum. They help support the importance of building the relationships in mathematics while distinguishing between which topics are in the foreground and which are in the background at each grade level.  •	 The introductory statement at each grade level emphasizes the central role that mathematical processes must play in a coherent curriculum. It also reminds us that instructional design in mathematics must support the development of key mathematical ideas in ways that promote problem solving, reasoning, communication, making connections, and designing and analyzing representations.",8,mtms2007-09-78a,,

"By considering both the organizational concept and the mathematical content of Curriculum Focal Points, mathematics teachers and instructional leaders can design effective instruction based on focused content supported by appropriate connections, contexts, and tools and addressed through the development and application of mathematical processes. In the next three articles in this series, we will look at specific content threads from the perspective of a focused curriculum in grades 5–8. We hope that sharing some specific examples of possible ways to implement NCTM’s Curriculum Focal Points from both the concept and content perspectives will help you move toward a more focused curriculum. We challenge you to discuss with your colleagues these two aspects of focusing your mathematics curriculum. Consider using this series of articles as a tool for productive professional discussions or for reflection about your curriculum and how you teach it.",10,mtms2007-09-78a,,
