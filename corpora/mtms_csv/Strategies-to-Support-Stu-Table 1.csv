0,Strategies to Support Students Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"An important question for mathematics teachers is this: “How can we help students learn mathematics to solve everyday problems, rather than teaching them only to memorize rules and practice mathematical procedures?” Teaching students using modeling activities can help them learn mathematics in real-world problem-solving situations that are useful outside school (Lesh and Doerr 2003b).",,
1,Strategies to Support Students Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Lesh and Lehrer (2003) defined mathematical modeling as a process of designing and revising representations to solve problems. Modeling, also described in the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSM), is one of the eight Standards for Mathematical Practice: “Mathematically proficient students can apply the mathematics they know to solve problems arising in everyday life, society, and the workplace” (CCSSI 2010, p. 7). By including modeling as a mathematical practice, CCSSM invites teachers to strategize ways to develop students’ mathematical modeling.",,
2,Strategies to Support Students Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Because CCSSM provides a brief description of modeling, teachers might interpret modeling in various ways (e.g., the demonstration of a lesson, construction of a physical object, or simulating a process) (Imm and Lorber 2013). Collaboration among teachers and researchers to implement modeling activities can be a valuable way to promote a better understanding of modeling for teachers. Through collaboration, researchers can bring relatively abstract and isolated knowledge to the table in a way that makes these ideas more applicable to the classroom (Hiebert, Gallimore, and Stigler 2002). At the same time, teachers can be involved in making decisions about what change is relevant for their students’ learning (Richardson 1990). This article describes the strategies that two middle school teachers and their students used while working on modeling activities with me, a researcher, over a semester.",,
3,Strategies to Support Students Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,DESCRIBING OUR JOURNEY,,
4,Strategies to Support Students Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Two eighth-grade teachers, Kate and Megan (both names are pseudonyms), worked with me when I volunteered to serve as a visiting scholar to help integrate research and new approaches into mathematics classrooms at a local, Midwestern school with a diverse student population (i.e., about 60 percent Caucasian, 12 percent African American, and 20 percent Hispanic). Approximately 70 percent of the students participated in the free or reduced-price federal lunch program. Both teachers taught five different classes for seven periods every day: two inclusion classes, two general education classes, and one co-taught inclusion class. Inclusion classes contained low-achieving students and students with special needs, whereas general education classes had average-achieving students. Other teachers at the middle school taught the advanced classes with high-achieving students. The two teachers and I decided to co-develop and co-teach modeling lessons using Model-Eliciting Activities (MEAs) that we implemented three times during my eleven weeks at the school.",,
5,Strategies to Support Students Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,MODEL-ELICITING ACTIVITIES (MEAs),,
6,Strategies to Support Students Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"An MEA is a mathematical task wherein teams of three to five students solve realistic mathematical problems (Lesh et al. 2000). When students engage with an MEA, they describe, evaluate, and revise models over one or two class periods. For example, in the Volleyball MEA (Lesh and Doerr 2003a), teams of students are asked to write a letter describing a process for creating equal teams that would accommodate a very large number of volleyball players. Figure 1 shows a modified version of the Volleyball MEA that Kate and Megan taught in their classrooms. Lesh and Doerr (2003a) emphasize that MEAs are designed to help students develop a sharable, modifiable, and reusable tool, rather than answer narrowly specified story problems. Their overall design principles for an MEA are summarized in table 1 (Lesh et al. 2000).",,

9,Strategies to Support Students Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,MODIFYING THE MEA,,
10,Strategies to Support Students Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"When the original Volleyball MEA was piloted with other students, it took more than 50 minutes, which was one class period for both teachers. We discussed to what extent the lesson, as designed, would be appropriate for the students, especially those with special needs. Kate and Megan were concerned that their students might be overwhelmed by all the data presented in the original MEA. Because reducing the amount of data would not violate the design principles for an MEA, we changed the number of players from eighteen to eight and the number of spike-result attempts from five to three, as shown in figure 1. Providing activity sheets containing a lot of words might challenge students, so we decided to use PowerPoint® to show both images and a condensed version of the information.",,
11,Strategies to Support Students Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,USING VARIOUS STRATEGIES,,
12,Strategies to Support Students Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"When we modified, implemented, and reflected on the Volleyball activity, we used strategies that supported students’ development of the modeling process. The strategies presented in this article were each identified to help students meet the goals of the design principles shown in table 1. The following examples of these strategies resulted from an analysis of audiotaped interviews and discussions with the two teachers and their students’ written work.",,
13,Strategies to Support Students Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,1. Reality: Ask students questions so they understand the task on the basis of their own real-life experiences.,,
14,Strategies to Support Students Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,2. Effective prototype: Guide students through questioning to develop a mathematically significant model.,,
15,Strategies to Support Students Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,3. Model generalizability: Remind students to construct a model that is generalizable.,,
16,Strategies to Support Students Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,4. Model documentation: Require students to document their process.,,
17,Strategies to Support Students Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,5. Model construction: Facilitate discussion in which students present the process of developing their model.,,
18,Strategies to Support Students Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,6. Self-evaluation: Encourage students to use peer-review forms to evaluate their own responses.,,
19,Strategies to Support Students Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,These teacher strategies are discussed in greater detail in the following sections.,,
20,Strategies to Support Students Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Reality,,
21,Strategies to Support Students Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"To help students engage with the problem context, we showed them a short video clip at the beginning of the lesson and asked them if they had ever played volleyball. Students were also introduced to the problem shown in the PowerPoint slides and asked the following questions to help them make sense of the real-life situation:",,
22,Strategies to Support Students Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,• “What problem is the camp having?” and,,
23,Strategies to Support Students Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,• “Why do you think the camp had a lack of competition last year?”,,
24,Strategies to Support Students Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We then asked if they knew volleyball terminology, such as kill, out of bounds, returned, and in the net. Rather than having the teacher explain them, we asked some of the volunteering students to explain the meanings of the terms to the whole class.",,
25,Strategies to Support Students Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Effective Prototype,,
26,Strategies to Support Students Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"When students read the table in figure 1, we wanted them to mathematically consider the real-life context. Students were asked:",,
27,Strategies to Support Students Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,• Who is the tallest player among those listed in the table?,,
28,Strategies to Support Students Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,• Which player can jump the highest?,,
29,Strategies to Support Students Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,• Is this the same person as the player who can reach the highest point? Why or why not?,,
30,Strategies to Support Students Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"After teaching the lesson, Megan described another example of how she encouraged students to develop a mathematically significant model:",,
31,Strategies to Support Students Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"With my fifth hour, we threw in some more concepts like “Eight out of ten serves equals what percent?” Eighty percent. And we kind of went into, “What’s this group’s percentage for spike results? What’s this team’s percentage on serve results?”",,
32,Strategies to Support Students Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"These questions helped students use the mathematical concepts that underlie the task to create models for complex situations. Figure 2, for example, shows that a student recorded spike results (e.g., 2/5, 4/5) and used them to divide the players into two teams.",,
33,Strategies to Support Students Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
34,Strategies to Support Students Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Model Generalizability,,
35,Strategies to Support Students Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Even though the problem states that “They will use your process for the next camp when they need to split a large number of players into equal teams,” students often focused on creating their two equal teams, rather than developing a model that could be used to split a large number of players. Kate explained how she reminded students that their process should work for twenty or more players:",,
36,Strategies to Support Students Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"A lot of them think of what’s in front of them. They don’t think of the aftereffect or what might have to come next. A lot of them would think here and now. So I keep reminding them, so then once they get focused in one thing, they would focus on just eight kids and they wouldn’t think about “Why am I putting these kids into those groups?” So I remind them this might be twenty or a hundred, that way they would go back to the concrete reasoning of why I’m putting these kids in these groups. And maybe ask them to write out more than just the kids’ names.",,
37,Strategies to Support Students Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Kate helped students move beyond what was immediately in front of them to think about the broader applicability of their solutions. Her strategy helped students develop a generalizable model that works for other similar situations (see fig. 3).,,
38,Strategies to Support Students Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
39,Strategies to Support Students Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Model Documentation,,
40,Strategies to Support Students Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"During the group work, students were asked to document all the processes they used. They added this information under the table in a section labeled “Use this space for organizing your process” (see fig. 2). Documenting their work reminded students of their thought processes when discussing the work in their groups and with the whole class. Each group also wrote a letter to the camp organizer, which included the students’ step-by-step strategy to split the teams (see fig. 3). This documentation helped students summarize their work and explain their mathematical and nonmathematical interpretation of the problem context.",,
41,Strategies to Support Students Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Model Construction,,
42,Strategies to Support Students Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"During this activity, students had several opportunities to provide an explicit explanation for a mathematically significant context. Megan described how she encouraged students to discuss in their own groups.",,
43,Strategies to Support Students Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Because what we discussed earlier with the groups, a lot of them just sat there, they didn’t do anything. So if you make them think individually, then they have something to share, then they have something to discuss, whereas if you just say, “Here’s the information, discuss it,” two kids talk, the other kids don’t do anything. So if they have something already written in front of them, they have something to share. . . . When it came to the discussion time, they were like, “Why did you pick those four?” “How did you pick those four?” They had a really good discussion. And . . . they were arguing who’s right, who’s wrong. It was neat.",,
44,Strategies to Support Students Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"After the discussions, students presented their work. We selected three or four teams that had created different models to solve the problem so that the other students could see that multiple reasonable solutions were possible.",,
45,Strategies to Support Students Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Self-Evaluation,,
46,Strategies to Support Students Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"After the selected teams presented their work, the other students wrote on their reflection forms, including what they thought would be the best way for the camp organizer to fairly divide the campers into two teams (see fig. 4).This process helped the listeners reflect on their answers by comparing the presenters’ solutions with their own solutions, which then informed their revisions. For example, one student realized the possibility of considering all the data after seeing the other presentations (see fig. 4). By using this form, teachers gave students the opportunity to assess their solutions and then revise their own model if desired.",,
47,Strategies to Support Students Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
48,Strategies to Support Students Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,RELATING STRATEGIES TO CCSSM,,
49,Strategies to Support Students Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Students presented their mathematical strategies to both their small group and the whole class while engaging with the modeling activity. Their strategies revealed that they performed several of the mathematical practices described in CCSSM. First, many of the students seemed to “make sense of problems and persevere in solving them” (CCSSI 2010, p. 6). For example, students were introduced to the problem contexts and analyzed the given stories or data, constraints, and goals. When students were stuck on a problem, they were encouraged to think about the problem again before asking questions of the teacher. To present and reflect on their procedures, they had to make sense of their own approaches and also understand the approaches used by their classmates. Such comparisons helped them better understand the problem and suggested an integrated approach to solve the problem when they reflected on the activity.",,
50,Strategies to Support Students Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Second, the MEA helped the students “construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others” (CCSSI 2010, pp. 6-7). Students communicated their solutions with others, asked questions during the presentations, and justified their reasons. For example, once a group presented its work, teachers asked the other students, “What questions do you have?” By encouraging students to direct their questions to the presenters, teachers allowed the students to make sense of others’ work when the presenters justified their procedures and solutions. This process gave students the opportunity to compare the effectiveness of others’ solutions with their own and make modifications if necessary. Furthermore, students described and justified their mathematical procedures in writing by composing a letter to camp organizers.",,
51,Strategies to Support Students Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The students were also encouraged to “attend to precision” (CCSSI 2010, p. 7). Students had to be careful about units of measure (e.g., feet, inches) and needed to express numerical answers that were appropriate for the problem contexts. For example, figure 2 shows how a student changed feet to inches to combine the height of a player and the vertical jump in inches. When the student explained her solution to her group members, she had to communicate precisely with others so that they could produce a single group letter integrating their approaches.",,
52,Strategies to Support Students Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,DEVELOPING MODELING PRACTICE,,
53,Strategies to Support Students Mathematical Modeling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Over the semester, teachers interpreted student work and developed assessment tasks that they used in their own practice. They addressed variability in the classroom, such as working with diverse students and classroom environments. Teachers also evaluated their own instructional goals and assessment strategies to plan subsequent lessons. This process of observing, developing, evaluating, and modifying classroom activities is considered a model-eliciting activity at the teacher level (Doerr and Lesh 2003; Lesh and Kelly 2000). As teachers went through this process, students also expressed, tested, and revised their conceptual models as they constructed solutions to real-world problems. When teachers set out to engage students in this modeling practice, students also ended up being engaged in other practices, such as persevering in solving problems, communicating mathematically, and attending to precision. This multitiered, experimental teaching model (Lesh and Kelly 2000) has the potential to develop students’ modeling skills as teachers develop ways to teach modeling in their classrooms.",,
