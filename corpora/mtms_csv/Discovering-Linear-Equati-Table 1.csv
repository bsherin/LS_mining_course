0,Discovering Linear Equations in Explicit Tables - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"When teaching algebra concepts to middle school students, I often hear questions that echo my own past confusion as a young student learning to write linear equations using data tables that show only input and output values. Students, expected to synthesize the relationship between these values in symbolic representation, grow frustrated when they do not recognize that implicit relationship quickly. All students, regardless of prior knowledge and experiences, can explore pattern tasks (Smith 2007). The structure of a four-column explicit table allows students of all abilities (from low achieving to honor students) to understand the relationship between the values found in linear equation tables. After implementing four-column tables, I found that students required less instructional interference from me, they developed self-efficacy, understood and retained the material, and attained higher year-end test scores.",,
1,Discovering Linear Equations in Explicit Tables - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Philipp (2007) notes that some teachers equate understanding with memorization, requiring students to memorize processes and algorithms. Expanding two-column tables into four columns helps students see linear patterns and can later help them compare the patterns to other function types. Herein, I outline how teachers implement this process in a mid-socioeconomic, suburban, predominantly white middle school that includes grades 79, a typical middle school makeup for our state. The purpose of this article is to illustrate how an explicit four-column table structure can extend students understanding of linearity, beginning with seventh-grade proportional reasoning and leading to tenth-grade concepts of linear transformations.",,

3,Discovering Linear Equations in Explicit Tables - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In middle school, teachers often use tables as a storage space for data points resulting from a function machine. An input passes through a funnel, and an output emerges. Although some students quickly recognize the algorithm to produce this output, others grow frustrated trying to decipher the clues.",,
4,Discovering Linear Equations in Explicit Tables - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,The Connected Mathematics Project curricula and Ellis and Ely (2011) emphasize the importance of helping students look for rates of change through patterns in sequential tables. Rubenstein (2002) extends this strategy to illuminate the repeated addition of the rate of change in an expanded (or explicit) table. Teachers can guide students to write this pattern by adding an additional column between the inputs and outputs that highlights the linear growth. Students can abbreviate that pattern in a fourth column to reveal the explicit equation that was elusive with just the two-column table. Students in seventh grade can quickly comprehend this process and understand the tenets of the seventh-grade Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSM) (CCSSI 2010) involving linear relationships.,,
5,Discovering Linear Equations in Explicit Tables - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,PROPORTIONAL REASONING AND JOSHS JOGGING RATE,,
6,Discovering Linear Equations in Explicit Tables - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Tables, graphs, and data of proportional or direct variation relationships include the point (0, 0). Students focus on how the y-values in a table with sequential x-values change; then they write functions in y = mx form. A story problem used in all grades at our middle school involves Josh jogging at a rate of 300 feet per minute. Students easily write a table for which the input M represents the number of minutes and the output F represents the number of feet Josh jogs. In seventh grade, teachers help students recognize that the output is proportionally related to the input and tie the understanding of scale and proportion to the concept of the repeated addition. The y-values increase in relation to the x-values by a constant amount (see fig. 1).",,
7,Discovering Linear Equations in Explicit Tables - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
8,Discovering Linear Equations in Explicit Tables - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"As students fill in the first three columns of Joshs four-column table with the minutes, pattern, and feet, they may tire of writing the repeated change (+300) on each line. Requiring students to write the entire pattern from zero to seven minutes, however, results in students requesting to make the process easier by using multiplication rather than repeated addition (see fig. 2).",,
9,Discovering Linear Equations in Explicit Tables - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
10,Discovering Linear Equations in Explicit Tables - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"They then fill in the shorthand column, rewriting the pattern using multiplication instead of repeated addition. Teachers can emphasize where and how rates of change occur in the table, helping students connect the four representations of table, graph, equation, and story. Students can then derive how far Josh will jog, even if they do not know the number of minutes, by noting that the x represents the unknown number of times the constant rate of change (300) repeats in the pattern. For proportions, students may quickly write the algorithm using two-column tables. However, the use of explicit four-column tables in seventh grade links the concept of direct variation to that of linear shift, or y-intercept, introduced in the eighth grade.",,
11,Discovering Linear Equations in Explicit Tables - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,SLOPE INTERCEPT,,
12,Discovering Linear Equations in Explicit Tables - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The introduction of a y-intercept, or vertical shift, in slope intercept form is a logical next step for eighth graders using explicit four-column tables. Using the example above, Josh stops by Austins house so that they can walk together to the tennis courts, but Austin has already left. Given only the graph, students track Joshs and Austins distances to create data tables connecting the meaning of the data on the graph to their data tables (see fig. 3).",,
13,Discovering Linear Equations in Explicit Tables - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
14,Discovering Linear Equations in Explicit Tables - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Classes can discuss (a) the differences in Josh and Austins walking rates, (b) Austins head start in feet, (c) Austins head start in minutes, and (d) when Josh and Austin will meet. These discussion points help students compare and contrast the two tables and graphs. Students can recognize Joshs table from their seventh-grade practice. Austins table, however, introduces his head start at zero minutes because he is already 600 feet ahead. Austins table pattern begins at 600 feet at 0 minutes. Students add his constant walking rate of 200 feet for each additional minute. (In the shorthand column, students may list the 600 feet first as it appears in the pattern, but they should understand that y = mx + b and y = b + mx are equivalent equations.) (See fig. 4.)",,
15,Discovering Linear Equations in Explicit Tables - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
16,Discovering Linear Equations in Explicit Tables - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"By expanding the table to include negative x-values, students can subtract Austins rate until his distance equals 0 and minutes are 3. Students should understand that this 3 reflects a 3-minute head start. Most often, students learn to find the x-intercept by replacing y with 0 and solving for x. A lesson extension might include how students point out that this rate of change (200 feet per one minute) occurs three times from zero feet to 600 feet (see fig. 5). They can see the number of minutes head start by dividing the y-intercept by the slope. By asking students to write an equivalent equation showing this division, teachers lead students from Austins slope-intercept equation,",,
17,Discovering Linear Equations in Explicit Tables - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
18,Discovering Linear Equations in Explicit Tables - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"y = 200x + 600,",,
19,Discovering Linear Equations in Explicit Tables - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"to the equivalent equation,",,
20,Discovering Linear Equations in Explicit Tables - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"y = 200(x + 3),",,
21,Discovering Linear Equations in Explicit Tables - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"in which students can then find the additive inverse of the x-intercept, so that (x + 3) makes y = 0 only where x = 3. Additionally, this extension provides a connection to transformations and x-intercepts of all function types. (See fig. 5.)",,
22,Discovering Linear Equations in Explicit Tables - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The structure of the explicit four-column table gives students of all learning abilities the opportunity to relate the slope in the equation y = mx + b to the repeated addition that is occurring in the table. Richland, Stigler, and Holyoak (2012) note that success in college mathematics begins in Kgrade 12 schools in which students learn to connect concepts to procedures. This framework helps develop those connections and is equally important as teachers introduce the development of recursive and explicit equations in ninth grade.",,
23,Discovering Linear Equations in Explicit Tables - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,EXPLICIT AND RECURSIVE EQUATIONS,,
24,Discovering Linear Equations in Explicit Tables - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"By ninth grade, students recognize the explicit equation in the shorthand column. Teachers can add the descriptors recursive and explicit to these processes. Intuitively, students write recursive equations as they add or subtract a constant to arrive at the value of a successive output. Quinn (2005) states that preservice teachers believe that sequences should be taught using a memorized formula with new variables and that only after students develop proficiency with algorithms can students make sense of sequences in real-world applications. However, students use both recursive and explicit equations regularly in contextual explicit tables. Teachers can help students connect the addition and subtraction in the pattern column to arithmetic sequences and function notation without algorithm memorization. In this example, students add 200 feet for each successive minute that Austin walks, thus producing an arithmetic sequence.",,
25,Discovering Linear Equations in Explicit Tables - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Teachers can also now introduce another important extension of linear functions: point-slope equations. Starting the table for Austins location at 4 minutes, students will generally write the inputs and outputs as they have done when beginning the table at 0 minutes (see fig. 6).",,
26,Discovering Linear Equations in Explicit Tables - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
27,Discovering Linear Equations in Explicit Tables - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"When students check their outputs with their shorthand equations, they recognize that substituting only the minute values in the resultant equation produces incorrect outputs, and they make the adjustment. Students modify the tables shorthand to correct the outputs and note that by subtracting the initial number of minutes in the table (in this case, 4) from the initial number of minutes, the multiplier (M  4) equals the number of times that the slope repeats in the pattern (see fig. 7).",,
28,Discovering Linear Equations in Explicit Tables - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
29,Discovering Linear Equations in Explicit Tables - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Starting the table at different inputs reaffirms that this modification aligns with any initial input value. Through these incremental changes to the problem, students recognize and understand the algorithm y = m(x  h) + k, where h is the initial input chosen (4 minutes) and k is the starting value (1400 feet). Subtracting the k from both sides of the equation reveals the form y  k = m(x  h). In figure 7, this provides the initial starting point of (4, 1400).",,
30,Discovering Linear Equations in Explicit Tables - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,LINEAR TRANSFORMATIONS,,
31,Discovering Linear Equations in Explicit Tables - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Next, students learn to apply transformations to function families that begin with linear transformations. The following excerpt from a class discussion illustrates how these connections unfolded in a class of ninth-grade honor students. These students had completed a unit on basic transformations of vertical shift and stretch from y = mx + b equations and the horizontal shift in the y = m(x + b/m) equation. They had not, however, learned point-slope form of a linear equation.",,
32,Discovering Linear Equations in Explicit Tables - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I presented a story problem about a pilot who is offered a job flying an aircraft for $85,000 per year plus $20 for each hour of flight. I asked the students to set up an explicit four-column table to derive an equation to show how much the pilot would make each year. I wrote their tables on the board. They quickly derived the equation y = 85,000 + 20x and produced figure 8, protesting that they did not need four columns to find the equation.",,
33,Discovering Linear Equations in Explicit Tables - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
34,Discovering Linear Equations in Explicit Tables - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"When I asked if the company owners would be satisfied if the pilot flew the plane 0 hours, students acknowledged that 0 would not be an appropriate place to start the table. I asked how many hours they thought the pilot would have to fly, and they created a new table at 200 hours (see fig. 9).",,
35,Discovering Linear Equations in Explicit Tables - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
36,Discovering Linear Equations in Explicit Tables - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Teacher: With the pattern all filled out, write the equation if we dont know how many hours the pilot will fly.",,
37,Discovering Linear Equations in Explicit Tables - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Loren: $89,000+ 20x",,
38,Discovering Linear Equations in Explicit Tables - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"John: No, that wont work.",,
39,Discovering Linear Equations in Explicit Tables - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Teacher: Why not?,,
40,Discovering Linear Equations in Explicit Tables - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"John: If you plug in 0 hours, he makes $89,000 when we already know that he gets paid $85,000 for 0 hours.",,
41,Discovering Linear Equations in Explicit Tables - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Amanda suggested that we start again at $85,000, but the class recognized that that would not reflect starting at 200 hours.",,
42,Discovering Linear Equations in Explicit Tables - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"John: I think you should just write 89,000 + 20(x  200).",,
43,Discovering Linear Equations in Explicit Tables - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Teacher: Where did the  200 come from?,,
44,Discovering Linear Equations in Explicit Tables - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,John: I dont know. It just makes it work right.,,

46,Discovering Linear Equations in Explicit Tables - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Teacher: Why + 200?,,
47,Discovering Linear Equations in Explicit Tables - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Jeff: Cause you started with 200, so its like adding 200 to the equation.",,
48,Discovering Linear Equations in Explicit Tables - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Loren: Yeah, you should add 200.",,
49,Discovering Linear Equations in Explicit Tables - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Amanda: But that messes up the y-intercept.,,
50,Discovering Linear Equations in Explicit Tables - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,I pulled their attention back to the first table to focus on the role of the components of the equation. Alice noticed that the numbers in the x column matched the numbers in the parentheses in the shorthand.,,
51,Discovering Linear Equations in Explicit Tables - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Teacher: We see a 0 and a 0, a 1 and a 1, a 2 and a 2. But over on this table, we dont see that. Can we fix it?",,
52,Discovering Linear Equations in Explicit Tables - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,The students realized that the shorthand with the number of 20s in the pattern produced the correct output until the equation reflected an unknown number of hours. Replacing x with a random value no longer produced the corresponding output.,,
53,Discovering Linear Equations in Explicit Tables - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Jeff: Yeah, you just add 200 to each of them to make them match.",,
54,Discovering Linear Equations in Explicit Tables - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"John: No, you have to subtract 200 to make them match.",,
55,Discovering Linear Equations in Explicit Tables - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Teacher: So, if you just subtract 200 from every one of your xs that the table will work out and the numbers will match up?",,
56,Discovering Linear Equations in Explicit Tables - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"John: Oh, shoot, no.",,
57,Discovering Linear Equations in Explicit Tables - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Christopher: Yes, it will. Subtracting 200 from every x will give you the number in the parentheses, so the equation is y = 89,000 + 20(x  200).",,
58,Discovering Linear Equations in Explicit Tables - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Alice: But will that work every time? Like, will it work for 400 hours?",,
59,Discovering Linear Equations in Explicit Tables - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The class checked various values for x hours and became convinced that their equation was equivalent to the first equation from the first table. I then turned the classs attention to how to plot the new equation on a graph. The class agreed that both equationsy = 85,000 + 20x and y = 89,000 + 20(x  200)should yield the same graph. At first glance, they believed the equations had different y-intercepts. We started by graphing the first equation on the grid. I then asked where the y-intercept of the second equation should be. When they said (0, 89,000), I marked it on the graph.",,
60,Discovering Linear Equations in Explicit Tables - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Loren: No, the equations are equivalent, so they cant have different values at 0.",,

62,Discovering Linear Equations in Explicit Tables - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Teacher: What do you mean?,,
63,Discovering Linear Equations in Explicit Tables - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Christopher: The 200 is like a horizontal shift.,,

74,Discovering Linear Equations in Explicit Tables - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"This advanced class initially saw the creation of the original explicit four-column table as a monotonous and unnecessary way to find the slope-intercept form of an equation that they derived without a table. However, the dialogue resulting from the second table and the comparison to the first table and the graph linked the shifts and stretch of the equationto transformations in the point-slope equation. After experimenting with other inputs, they discovered the convenience of the point-slope form. They then asked why teachers had not taught this form previously. I explained how they had been taught point slope form starting with y = mx but the vertical and horizontal shifts then were simply 0 or y = m(x  0) + 0.",,

Teachers can help students discover these patterns and then extend those concepts to prepare for successive years to include other high school concepts in other function families: quadratic, cubic, and so on.
