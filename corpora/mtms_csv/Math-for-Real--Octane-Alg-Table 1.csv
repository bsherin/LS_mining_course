The PON is generally in the 94−96 range, and the MON is in the 85−87 range. What is the range for the RON? 5.  Although automobile gasoline typically has a maximum of 91, Great Britain and France both have PONs of 98 and MONs in the high 80s. What are their possible RONs? 6.  a.  What possible values can  produce a PON of 87? Construct a graph that shows a constant PON of 87.    b.  Similarly, consider different  ways to make a PON of 91 and construct a graph that shows a constant PON of 91.  c.  What is the slope of each graph? ",12,Math for Real: Octane Algebra
