3,Math for Real: Space and Time,"For many years, people have been fascinated with the sun, moon, stars, planets, and other objects in the sky. How do we know what is happening up there? Let’s investigate how long  it takes light from those objects to reach Earth.  1.  Light travels at about   300,000 km/sec. The distance  of the sun from Earth is about  150 million km.",3,Math for Real: Space and Time
4,Math for Real: Space and Time,"3.  The closest star to our sun, Proxima Centauri, is about  3.99 × 1013 km away.",4,Math for Real: Space and Time
5,Math for Real: Space and Time,a. Express this number in words.,5,Math for Real: Space and Time
6,Math for Real: Space and Time,"b.  How long does it take the light from Proxima Centauri to arrive on Earth? Give your answers in seconds, then in years.  4.  A light-year is the distance   7.  How old is the information we get  a.  How long does the light from the sun take to reach our windows, in seconds? b. How long is this in minutes? traveled by light in 1 year. How long is a light-year in kilometers?  5.  The Milky Way, the center of our  galaxy, is about 2.55 × 1017 km from the solar system.",6,Math for Real: Space and Time
7,Math for Real: Space and Time,"2.  What does your answer to question 1 mean? If a spaceship coming from “a galaxy far, far away” destroyed our sun right now, when would we get this information? Do we know what is happening on the sun in real time? What information do we have about the sun? a.  How many light-years is   2.55 × 1017 km? b.  When you look at that starry  part of the sky during the summer nights, how old is the light that is reaching your eyes? How old is the information that light is carrying?",7,Math for Real: Space and Time

Manuscripts should show how math is used to solve a real-life problem, preferably in the context of one’s profession, and should be no more than 300 words. Submit manuscripts through http://mtms.msubmit.net.  6.  Quasars are very bright, distant galaxies thought to be powered by massive black holes at their  centers. The most distant  quasar found to date is  ULAS J1120+0641, which is  12.9 billion light-years away.  How many kilometers is  12.9 billion light-years?   from quasar ULAS J1120+0641? What does it mean, considering that the age of the universe is estimated at approximately  13.7 billion years?",8,Math for Real: Space and Time
