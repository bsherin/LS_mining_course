12,On My Mind: Principles to Actions: Mathematics Programs as the Core for Student Learning,"Mathematics (NCTM) launched the “standards-based” education movement in North America in 1989 with the release of Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for School Mathematics, an unprecedented action to promote systemic improvement in mathematics education. Now, twenty-five years later, the widespread adoption of the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSM) by fortyfive states provides an opportunity to reenergize and focus our commitment to significant improvement in mathematics education (CCSSI 2010).

14,On My Mind: Principles to Actions: Mathematics Programs as the Core for Student Learning,"The need for coherent standards  has been endorsed across all states and provinces, even by those who have not adopted CCSSM. As NCTM has stated, “The CCSSM offers a foundation for the development of more rigorous, focused, and coherent  mathematics curricula, instruction, and assessments that promote conceptual understanding and reasoning as well as skill fluency. This foundation will help to ensure that all students are ready for college and the workplace when they graduate from high school and that they are prepared to take their place as productive, full participants in society” (NCTM 2013).",14,On My Mind: Principles to Actions: Mathematics Programs as the Core for Student Learning
15,On My Mind: Principles to Actions: Mathematics Programs as the Core for Student Learning,"However, we must remember that standards set the bar for what students should learn, but it is the teachers who do the teaching. CCSSM focuses and clarifies common outcomes for student learning and promotes coherence across grades through mathematics learning progressions. Those standards encourage the development of new instructional resources and assessments, but they do not tell teachers and others what to do at the classroom, school, and district levels  or how to begin making essential changes to implement these Standards. Thus, NCTM’s new Principles to Actions: Ensuring Mathematical Success for All (NCTM 2014) provides direction in fi lling the gap between the adoption of CCSSM and the enactment of policies and programs required for its widespread and successful implementation. The overarching message conveyed in Principles to Actions is that— • effective teaching is the non- negotiable core that ensures all students learn mathematics; and • such teaching requires a range of  actions at the state/provincial, district, school, and classroom levels.",15,On My Mind: Principles to Actions: Mathematics Programs as the Core for Student Learning
