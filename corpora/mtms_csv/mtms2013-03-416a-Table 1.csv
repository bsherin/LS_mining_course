"Nicole R. Rigelman wWhat is mathematics? What does it  mean to do mathematics? The answers to these two questions critically infl uence the ways in which learners respond to a mathematical problem. On one hand, if they see questions as having only one correct answer and as needing to be solved in one particular way, they will be prone to treat mathematics as a rigid discipline. They will likely view it as a subject that one is either good at or not. On the other hand, if they see problems as opportunities to explore, create, and prove, they will experience the beauty and wonder of mathematics and realize that the unknown provides a chance for new learning.",3,mtms2013-03-416a,,
"Since the 1980s, numerous calls  have been made for increased attention to problem solving in the curriculum (NCTM 1980, 1989, 2000; NRC 1989, 2001), yet problem solving continues to exist at the periphery of the school mathematics curriculum rather than being central to how mathematics learning is taking place (Hiebert et al. 1997; Hiebert et al. 2003). With the release of the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSI 2010), we are reminded again that making sense of problems and  persevering in solving them are important mathematical practices that we seek to develop in our students. ",4,mtms2013-03-416a,,
"As a mathematics teacher, it is a struggle to help students see that problem solving is a process for learning mathematics and not an isolated task. I wanted my students to recognize that they were problem solving any time an immediate answer or solution path was not at hand. This goal led me to incorporate nonroutine problems regularly into the curriculum. One day, as I was distributing a problem, Chris asked, “Do we have to write this up so it can be scored?” At that moment, I realized that my goal was not achieved.",5,mtms2013-03-416a,,
"Both my students and I were focused on what I refer to now as problem performing instead of problem solving, the latter being the goal. Chris’s question helped me realize that the focus of problem solving had been on scoring when the focus needed to be on the act of solving the problem and on learning from that process. My hope was that problem solving would allow students to discover mathematical relationships and pose new questions of their own. Something about ",6,mtms2013-03-416a,,

"Chris posed the question about “writing up the problem” in the spring of his seventh-grade year. The next year, I approached my instruction differently. This article is based on my experience teaching an eighth-grade heterogeneous mathematics class in a suburban middle school that used reform-oriented curriculum materials. ",15,mtms2013-03-416a,,
"Even though these students  regularly engaged in problem situations, these situations were not always problematic. At time, this occurred because the curriculum materials did too much to walk students through the process. At other times, students immediately recognized a problem as similar to others they had seen, so they could apply and refine experiences for this new problem. Although this situation is not bad, it does not allow students to engage in true problem  solving. Basically, the students needed additional tasks beyond those in the curriculum materials if they were to engage in higher-level thinking and problem solving. I needed to provide tasks that would prompt students’ own questions and inquisitiveness. ",16,mtms2013-03-416a,,
"As various tasks were posed, students experienced increased discomfort because they did not know what to do or where to begin. Inspired by the writing process (i.e., prewrite, write, revise, edit, and publish) assigned by my humanities colleagues, a Problem Solving Journal became a vehicle for engaging students in the process of doing mathematics. Rather than placing the problem-solving focus on the end result, these journals were to engage students in a “prewrite” phase (Elbow 1998). ",17,mtms2013-03-416a,,
"They were not to worry about  taking every problem to the “publish” phase quite yet. I used this Problem Solving Journal to develop the habits of mind of a mathematician—using reasoning and sense making, modeling, looking for patterns, persevering, proving, and generalizing (Cuoco, Goldenberg, and Mark 1996). My inquiry into using the Problem Solving Journal to foster mathematical thinking and problem-solving habits of mind in my students resulted in redesigning the structures and processes I had used previously. ",18,mtms2013-03-416a,,
"Before using the writing journal,  my students were not engaging in a prewrite phase when confronted with a math problem. As they began work, they recorded what would be necessary in a final product; missteps or incorrect thinking were promptly erased. Elbow (1998), a writing professor, describes a parallel dilemma in writing and the need for free writing, a time to babble while disregarding grammar and spelling. At this early stage, students were free to explore a variety of possible solution paths and to write incorrect thinking or  thoughts they might later abandon. They also needed to realize that not everything they recorded in their journal would necessarily be shared. They needed to know that tentative ideas should be explored. ",19,mtms2013-03-416a,,
"They also needed to understand that it was acceptable to be stuck on a problem. As might occur with writing, the journal could be a place to record questions and frustrations as well as serve as a tool to help them get unstuck. Finally, their journals could be a place where they noted others’ ideas that they wanted to remember, observed connections across problems, and described what-if questions. If they selected one of these problems to “publish,” all elements would be available for students to draw on for their showcase problem.  conFRont existing BelieFs",20,mtms2013-03-416a,,
"To convince students that it was acceptable to work with a problem without necessarily finding a solution (Boaler 2002), I needed to better understand their beliefs about mathematics and what it means to do mathematics. Only then could these beliefs be changed. ",21,mtms2013-03-416a,,
"When the school year began, I asked my students about math and what it means to do math. I then shared the diagram called A Mathematician’s Work (see fig. 1). This diagram was inspired by the writing process described above and Principles and Standards for School Mathematics (NCTM 2000). A large copy of the diagram was posted on the wall so that students could reference various components throughout the year. It was my hope that as these behaviors were named and clearly valued, students would grow to see themselves as mathematicians.",22,mtms2013-03-416a,,

"The next step was selecting math tasks designed to encourage exploration and prompt the development of models,  conjectures, and generalizations. The problems needed to be interesting to students and worthy of their time. Sometimes these problems came directly from the curriculum materials; other problems were adapted from these materials or from other resources (a list can be found in the sidebar on  p. 418). The tasks typically connected to the content of the current unit or the unit we were finishing.",24,mtms2013-03-416a,,
"The problems were photocopied and prepared so students could glue them directly into their journals. On alternating Mondays, I gave students eight to twelve minutes to freely write on a new math problem. They made observations and sketches, asked what-if questions, and listed “I wonder” statements and/or connections they saw. This time was intentionally short so that students needed to continue working on the problem outside of class. During the two weeks, if students ever finished class work early, I encouraged them to discuss with other early finishers their thoughts and ideas and any relationships they discovered in their investigation of the problem. My colleagues often told me that similar conversations took place during free time in other classes. These journals encouraged students to jot down ideas along the way, free from concerns about a final draft.",25,mtms2013-03-416a,,
"On the second Monday, students  had about fifteen minutes to share their draft solution with a peer or small group. While students shared the draft, I listened, identified the strategies (make a systematic list, draw a diagram, use guess and check, and so on) that students used when appropriate, and recorded the strategy on a sentence strip if it was a new strategy. Over time, the sentence strips formed a bulletin board of problem-solving strategies and served as a reminder for students of possible strategies they could try if they were stuck.",26,mtms2013-03-416a,,

"The Baby Limitation problem  (see fig. 2) provided a context for this discussion and a view into students’  potential responses. Konold suggests that because the results of this problem are counterintuitive, it increases students’ interest and motivation (Konold 1994). Typically, students begin with the assumption that there is a 50-50 chance of a couple having a boy or girl. They generate data, often by flipping a coin, and track family size. Variation occurs with the number of families that students decide they need to simulate. Their sample sizes vary anywhere from 20 to 100. Finally, students draw ",40,mtms2013-03-416a,,

"When students have a strong sense about what counts as high-quality work, they will be better able to produce it. After students used this problem-solving format for three rounds, we collaboratively generated  a scoring guide that they could use while solving a problem. When asked what a quality response looks like, students brainstormed the typical attributes: clear communication; correct strategies and solutions; and multiple representations such as diagrams, models, tables, graphs, or formulas.",66,mtms2013-03-416a,,
"If students did not include important criteria, such as “justify why concepts and strategies are effective and reasonable,” I suggested the idea or shared a student work sample that illustrated these attributes. Involving students in this process helped them internalize the criteria for high-quality work. They then used this list to reflect on the quality of their own work and any revisions or additions they might want to make. After asking students to define general features of quality work, I followed up by asking what more would be needed to create exceptional work. The criteria were very close to those shown in figure 3, which represents a compilation of ideas from students as well as our state assessment scoring guide.

"The selection of tasks was a key component in this process. Students needed to engage in rich problems that had multiple entry points and that connected to the mathematical trajectory of the curriculum. Problems that students solved that were loosely related to problems already explored in class presented opportunities for them to make connections between strategies and or representations, even when there was no clear pathway to a solution. This scenario allowed them to dive in to the task with more confidence than might otherwise occur. For example, a number of students made a connection between the Baby Limitation problem and a binomial experiment that we  had explored (Checker-A game and Checker-B game from Shaughnessy and Arcidiacono 1993).",69,mtms2013-03-416a,,
"After seeing this connection, one  student did not seem overly challenged by the ideas in this problem. Her work initially included a tree diagram, with a short answer for the average number of children per family and the boy-to-girl ratio (see fig. 4). After discussing the task with a partner, she became much more engaged. Because her partner needed help to make sense of her tree diagram, she then created the data table to summarize what happened as the size of the family increased, commenting on the likelihood of the family makeup (number of boys and number of girls) per 100 families (see fig. 5). She also examined what would happen if she simulated this situation through coin tosses (see the data in fig. 6) and then compared these results with the theoretical results. Discussions with a partner, in addition to the expectation that students select a problem to “publish,” encouraged this student to investigate what-if questions that pressed her to make conjectures, analyze patterns, and offer generalizations.",70,mtms2013-03-416a,,
"This student’s actions revealed  potential limits of her understanding about the relationship between experimental and theoretical probability. Her initial work was brief yet solid. She delved deeper into what the data revealed about larger families (see  fig. 5) and examined her data from the simulation (see fig. 6, comments that 9 or more children “won’t happen with only 100 families”). Then she was ready to push aside data from families with more than 8 children. She explained that the larger families were not coming up in her simulation and that 8 or more children in a family represented less than 1 out of 100 families. Without this further development, I would not have known about this student’s understanding, and her limited conceptions would not have been evident. ",71,mtms2013-03-416a,,

"As mentioned previously, students received a new problem every two weeks throughout the year. At midterm and at the end of the term, as with the writing process, students reviewed their Problem Solving Journals to select a problem that they would like to revisit for publication and to selfassess using the Mathematics Problem Solving Scoring Guide (Oregon Department of Education 2011). This guide gave students a score for each dimension instead of one overall score as with the previous guide (see fig. 3). ",76,mtms2013-03-416a,,
"When they self-assessed, they recorded both a score and the reasoning behind it, citing specific evidence. ",77,mtms2013-03-416a,,
"The excerpts in figures 4–6 provide  evidence of the final product one student created and then self-assessed. Students were asked to justify that these were the accurate scores. Students also switched papers with a partner who assessed his or her work, recording both a score and the reasoning behind it, and then the pair met to discuss both items. The pair came to an agreement about the scores, and recorded this information on the work. ",78,mtms2013-03-416a,,

"As I used this Problem Solving Journal and the associated processes and structures, I discovered that over time, most students’ beliefs about mathematics and what it means to do mathematics began to shift. The journal gave students a place in which they felt free to explore. It helped them see connections across problems and document what they were learning from others. Because their work on the problems began as a draft, they could add notes about others’ thinking when ideas were prompted from their conversations with others. As noted in the example, sometimes they responded by determining that they needed to clarify their work for others.",81,mtms2013-03-416a,,
"The structure of publishing their work later motivated students to take the feedback they had gathered from others to create their own best work.
