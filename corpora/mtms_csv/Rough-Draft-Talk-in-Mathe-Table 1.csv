0,Rough-Draft Talk in Mathematics Classrooms - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Tricia (a seventh grader): I’m kind of really shy, so I’m, like, super conscious about when it comes to answering in front of people. . . . I was, like, always nervous that it would be wrong (Jansen 2006, p. 416).",,
1,Rough-Draft Talk in Mathematics Classrooms - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Some students are reluctant to participate in whole-class discussions. But if they do not participate, their peers will not learn from them. During discussions, many students believe that they should perform a “final draft” of correct and complete solutions (Jansen 2009). How can we create a classroom culture that supports continued learning during classroom discourse?",,
2,Rough-Draft Talk in Mathematics Classrooms - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Exploratory (or rough-draft) talk is one such productive strategy. Learning anything new involves “working on understanding” (Barnes 2008, p. 3). Rough-draft talk looks like false starts, expressions of uncertainty, and incomplete or imperfect sentences.",,
3,Rough-Draft Talk in Mathematics Classrooms - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Rough-draft talk is talking to learn. Familiar to students from language arts, rough-draft talk occurs when ideas become more connected and organized. Similar to writing, rough-draft talk is an iterative process.",,
4,Rough-Draft Talk in Mathematics Classrooms - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Creating a normative practice of rough-draft talk supports the engagement of more students. If rough-draft talk is valued, brainstormed ideas are welcomed. More students are likely to take risks rather than freeze during challenging tasks. Valuing a wider range of contributions invites greater involvement, in contrast to the same students who participate frequently or not at all.",,
5,Rough-Draft Talk in Mathematics Classrooms - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"When teachers create spaces for rough-draft talk, they continue to choose mathematical tasks that promote particular understandings, but they adjust their classroom discourse practices. For instance, to promote rough-draft talk, teachers talk more explicitly about how people learn and the role of talk in learning, highlighting that learning takes time and that talking through in-progress ideas supports learning. Three principles and practices support rough-draft talk. (See table 1.)",,
6,Rough-Draft Talk in Mathematics Classrooms - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
7,Rough-Draft Talk in Mathematics Classrooms - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Principle 1: Foster a culture supportive of intellectual risk taking.,,
8,Rough-Draft Talk in Mathematics Classrooms - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Explicitly tagging initial discussions of solutions as “rough drafts” encourages students to share in-progress thinking. This tagging reduces the threat of being wrong. A nonevaluative stance by the teacher empowers students.,,
9,Rough-Draft Talk in Mathematics Classrooms - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"To create a culture of risk taking, a teacher used a nonevaluative routine to discuss students’ thinking. She displayed a task and directed students to first use rough-draft talk in small groups. Groups shared initial ideas (rough-draft presentations) at a document camera, and the solutions were not evaluated. Students asked questions of their peers only when they needed clarification.",,
10,Rough-Draft Talk in Mathematics Classrooms - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Next, students returned to their groups and revised their thinking toward final-draft solutions, comparing their original ideas to presenters’ ideas. During a second round of presentations (final drafts), students were encouraged to critique their peers’ approaches. Then the teacher asked questions to guide students’ thinking while highlighting important ideas.",,
11,Rough-Draft Talk in Mathematics Classrooms - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The teacher posed the task in figure 1 to her sixth graders. She expected students to struggle with deciding on the correct operation for the problem: multiplication or division. When directing students to work in smallgroups, the teacher said, “This is just your rough-draft thinking right now.” Students drafted solutions on dry-erase boards.",,
12,Rough-Draft Talk in Mathematics Classrooms - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
13,Rough-Draft Talk in Mathematics Classrooms - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Before students shared rough-draft thinking at the document camera, the teacher said, “Remember, this is just our rough draft, so we’re not going to say if they’re right or wrong. But we might want to ask some questions.”",,
14,Rough-Draft Talk in Mathematics Classrooms - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"When members of two groups illustrated finding an answer of 10 by multiplying 5/6 by 12, a peer asked, “Why did you choose to multiply?”",,
15,Rough-Draft Talk in Mathematics Classrooms - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The presenter responded, “I feel like it would be a quicker way.”",,
16,Rough-Draft Talk in Mathematics Classrooms - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Another group’s rough-draft thinking involved converting 5/6 of a foot and 12 feet to inches. While showing the calculations at the document camera, a student explained, “We took the 12 and did 12 times 12 and got 144. And then we did 2 times 5, which is 10, and then did 10 divided into 144 and got 14 pieces.”",,
17,Rough-Draft Talk in Mathematics Classrooms - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"A student asked, “Why did you divide 10 into 144? How come you did not multiply 144 and 10?”",,
18,Rough-Draft Talk in Mathematics Classrooms - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The presenter explained, “We would get too high of a number if we did that [multiplied 10 times 144].”",,
19,Rough-Draft Talk in Mathematics Classrooms - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The tag of “rough-draft” thinking promoted an open space for exploring initial solutions. A second round of group work followed. During final draft discussions, all groups decided that division was the appropriate operation and that the answer should be 14 instead of 10.",,
20,Rough-Draft Talk in Mathematics Classrooms - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Principle 2: Promote the belief that learning mathematics involves revising understanding over time.,,
21,Rough-Draft Talk in Mathematics Classrooms - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Revising mathematical thinking promotes learning through refining ideas. To enact the routine of “My Favorite Rough Draft,” the class revised a student’s explanation. (“My Favorite Rough Draft” is a modification of “My Favorite No,” https://www.teachingchannel.org/videos/class-warm-up-routine, in which a teacher analyzes a student’s error.) During revision, the class affirmed what was initially productive about the explanation.",,
22,Rough-Draft Talk in Mathematics Classrooms - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Students received a task on paper that had been inserted into a plastic sheet cover (see fig. 2). They wrote initial explanations in pairs and then used overhead projector pens to write on nonpermanent surfaces. This process promotes exploratory work (Liljedahl 2016).,,
23,Rough-Draft Talk in Mathematics Classrooms - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
24,Rough-Draft Talk in Mathematics Classrooms - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"This teacher wanted students to analyze the error in figure 2, but she wanted students to go beyond catching the error to elaborate on meanings underlying procedures. She also wanted to promote mathematically precise language, such as “combine like terms,” and the use of vocabulary, such as coefficient, constant, variable, expression, and exponent. Students’ initial explanations were assumed to be in rough-draft form. The students discussed initial explanations with a partner. An example of such rough-draft talk follows:",,
25,Rough-Draft Talk in Mathematics Classrooms - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Student: But then you have to think about it. You can’t do an exponent if you’re using . . . so, it’s 5x to the second power. You can’t do 5x to the second power plus 4x. It doesn’t work. Because 4x, it would have to go to the second power. You can’t add a second power to that.",,
26,Rough-Draft Talk in Mathematics Classrooms - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"After writing a first draft, students received peer feedback, in which two pairs exchanged explanations. Next, the class revised one explanation: the teacher’s favorite (anonymous) rough draft. All together, they discussed how to revise toward a final draft using more precise language.",,
27,Rough-Draft Talk in Mathematics Classrooms - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Principle 3: Raise students’ statuses by expanding on what counts as a valuable contribution.,,
28,Rough-Draft Talk in Mathematics Classrooms - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"When rough-draft talk is recognized as valuable for supporting learning, then more students can be positioned as competent mathematical thinkers (Cohen and Lotan 2014; Featherstone et al. 2011; Horn 2012). A teacher can ask a student to share, even if he or she is struggling to understand. In so doing, the teacher is making a public statement that this rough-draft talk is useful for the class’s learning.",,
29,Rough-Draft Talk in Mathematics Classrooms - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"An opportunity to raise a student’s status occurred when a class discussed qualitative graphs about speed depending on time. The teacher conjectured that when students first graph this situation, they would graph elevation versus time. (See fig. 3.) Students might draw an uphill line to initially represent pedaling uphill (rather than a downhill line to represent speed decreasing over time). Qualitative graphs can be used informally to get students to explore motion and recognize a change in rate at points.",,
30,Rough-Draft Talk in Mathematics Classrooms - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
31,Rough-Draft Talk in Mathematics Classrooms - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"A student shared her graph with the class. The teacher noticed that Jakeel wondered about it, so she called on Jakeel to share his rough-draft talk.",,
32,Rough-Draft Talk in Mathematics Classrooms - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Jakeel:  About the part that’s going down. How can you write that when you’re already at the top of the hill? You’re on your way up, but the straight line is above the top of the hill. You can’t start on the top of the hill if you’re going up.",,
33,Rough-Draft Talk in Mathematics Classrooms - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Teacher:  Can anyone answer that? It’s a good question.,,
34,Rough-Draft Talk in Mathematics Classrooms - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Jakeel:  The part that’s going down is at the top of the hill. How can you be above the top of the hill? That means you’d have to be in the air.,,
35,Rough-Draft Talk in Mathematics Classrooms - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Teacher:  Come show us the points that you’re talking about.,,
36,Rough-Draft Talk in Mathematics Classrooms - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Jakeel:  [Jakeel is at the overhead projector and points to the lowest point on the graph.] Right here. If that’s the top of the hill, how can it be up here [pointing to the straight line for constant speed]? It would be in the air. [See fig. 4.]",,
37,Rough-Draft Talk in Mathematics Classrooms - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
38,Rough-Draft Talk in Mathematics Classrooms - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Student:  Because the y-axis is the speed. Not the hill [elevation], but the speed.",,
39,Rough-Draft Talk in Mathematics Classrooms - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"After continued discussion, the teacher explicitly pointed out how Jakeel’s question allowed the class to have a better understanding of speed versus time.",,
40,Rough-Draft Talk in Mathematics Classrooms - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Teacher:  How many people thought similarly to Jakeel at first? [Students raise hands.] See, you’re not alone. It helped everyone to talk about this and understand it.",,
41,Rough-Draft Talk in Mathematics Classrooms - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Jakeel’s contribution was publicly treated as helpful and productive for the class. His rough-draft talk helped other students clarify their thinking.,,
42,Rough-Draft Talk in Mathematics Classrooms - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,ACROSS THE CLASSROOMS,,
43,Rough-Draft Talk in Mathematics Classrooms - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Explicit promotion of rough-draft talk takes productive classroom discourse to a higher level because it provides a safe space for students to develop understanding. When teachers developed new routines for nonevaluative sharing and promoted public revisions, students’ in-progress thinking was positioned as valuable. Such actions went going beyond the classrooms’ typical discourse. When these teachers asked their students how they felt about being incorrect in front of their peers, they made comments like these:",,
44,Rough-Draft Talk in Mathematics Classrooms - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"•  “I like it even when I’m wrong, because I learn from my group and get better.”",,
45,Rough-Draft Talk in Mathematics Classrooms - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"•  “It was a mistake that everyone makes. No big deal. Just fix it. Everyone will know that you might need help, and they will support you and teach you.”",,
