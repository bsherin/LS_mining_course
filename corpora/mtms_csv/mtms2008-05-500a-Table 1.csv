"What hurricane names do you remember? Wilma? Andrew? Katrina? Do you know how names of hurricanes are determined? Table 1 lists the names of past and future Atlantic tropical storms and hurricanes, as determined by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). What patterns do you notice in the array of names in table 1?  that track predicted storm paths are commonly seen on television and the Internet. The Weather Channel often receives number-one viewership ratings in regions encountering a major weather event, such as a hurricane or tornado (Kloer 2001). Mathematics teachers can tap into students’ curiosity and interest about hurricanes to develop their understanding of mathematical ideas within a real-life context. In this article, we discuss observations and findings after implementing mathematics tasks based on data about hurricanes. Finding patterns and relationships, creating and interpreting graphs, and examining rates of change are just a few of the topics that can be studied. We developed these tasks as part of the Students’ Transition Toward Algebra project and have used them with both middle school teachers and students. ",2,mtms2008-05-500a,,
"We found that discussing the patterns of tropical storm and hurricane names in table 1 as a class provided a good introduction for lessons involving mathematical ideas related to hurricanes. The students and teachers with whom we worked observed several patterns in the names:  •  “Each year, the names follow an  alphabetical order.”  •  “Across years, names starting with the same letter alternate between girl and boy names.” ",3,mtms2008-05-500a,,

"It is interesting to note that until 1979 the list contained only female names. At present, the names of tropical storms and hurricanes repeat on a 6-year cycle unless they are retired from the list. A name is retired when the storm it represents causes severe damage. The havoc wreaked by Katrina in 2005, for example, caused its name to be retired. Atlantic tropical storms are named in alphabetical order, beginning with A, for the first storm of each year. When a rainstorm originating over tropical waters reaches sustained wind speeds between 39 and 73 mph, it is assigned a name from the list. If it strengthens to sustained wind speeds of over 74 mph, it becomes a hurricane under the same name. Hurricanes are classified into five wind-speed categories based on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale (see fig. 1). The WMO coordinates tropical storm  and hurricane information, including regional lists of names, across different ocean basins all around the world. The lists of names follow different patterns and rules depending on the region of the Earth where the storms originate. Typically, storm names are taken from the culture of the people who live in the region of the storms. To infuse a cultural perspective into the storm-name activity, students can explore and compare patterns across different regional lists of names for tropical storms and hurricanes (known as typhoons or cyclones in some  world regions). More information on tropical storms, including the rules for regional names, can be found at the WMO Web site (www.wmo.ch/ index-en.html) (WMO 2006) or the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Web site ",241,mtms2008-05-500a,,

"The “Hurricane Tracking” task involves graphing, exploring, and examining the paths of hurricanes from a mathematical perspective. (See activity sheet 1, “Hurricane Tracking.”) To discuss the position of hurricanes traveling through regions around the Earth, it is important for students to understand latitude and longitude. To clarify students’ understanding of these terms, we use a world globe and a map containing scales of both longitude and latitude and encourage students to share their understanding of these ideas during class discussion.",260,mtms2008-05-500a,,
Background on  Latitude and Longitude,261,mtms2008-05-500a,,
"Globes of the Earth contain a coordinate grid that covers the sphere. Latitude and longitude on a globe use axes similar to the horizontal axis, x,  and vertical axis, y, of the Cartesian plane. On the globe, the equator may be thought of as the horizontal axis and the prime meridian as the vertical axis. The equator is the 0 degree latitudinal line drawn around the Earth. Degrees north or south of 0 are represented by circles parallel to the equator along the surface of the globe. These circles provide latitudinal positions on the surface of the Earth. The prime meridian is the 0 degree longitudinal line passing through Greenwich, England. Degrees east or west of 0 are represented by lines of longitude passing through the north and south poles. The lines of longitude to the east of the prime meridian are marked in degrees east; those to the west of the prime meridian are marked in degrees west. ",262,mtms2008-05-500a,,
"Cooperative Learning  for Hurricane Tracking For the “Hurricane Tracking” task, we placed students in pairs and designed the task to draw purposefully on key elements of effective cooperative learning experiences, as discussed by Johnson, Johnson, and Holubec (1994). One central element is “positive interdependence,” requiring that groups have a clear task and group goal. In this task, pairs of students  work jointly on graphing the paths of two hurricanes on one map and jointly complete the questions. We found that it was important to instruct the pairs on how we expected them to work cooperatively. It did not suffice to tell them just to work together with their partner. When the task was first implemented, students were not given instructions on ways to work cooperatively, and many pairs did not cooperate at a satisfactory level. We then agreed to implement the cooperative-learning structure as outlined in figure 2. Students were instructed on ways to work in pairs, such as sharing ideas and materials and taking turns recording responses to promote learning by both students. This scenario fostered a second element of effective cooperative learning, which is “faceto-face promotive interaction” ( Johnson, Johnson, and Holubec 1994). The students were also told that both partners were responsible for agreeing on and understanding task responses because during a class discussion, students would be randomly selected by the teacher to explain their thinking and responses to the questions. This arrangement promoted “individual accountability,” a third element of effective cooperative learning ( Johnson, Johnson, and Holubec 1994). As might be expected, the cooperation among the pairs improved greatly after students received instructions and expectations for working together.",263,mtms2008-05-500a,,
Graphing through Hurricane Tracking,264,mtms2008-05-500a,,
"Activity sheet 1 contains a table of positions for the two hurricane paths. Before beginning, we found it important for students to read and discuss as a class what represented a day in the path of a hurricane. For example, position 0 to position 1 represents the track of the hurricane on day 1; position 1 to position 2 represents day 2; and so forth. After the students completed activity sheet 1, we found ",265,mtms2008-05-500a,,

The students illustrated the direction of the hurricanes by using arrow marks (as used to define vectors) or numbering the points plotted for the paths with the corresponding position numbers.

It also gave students an opportunity to clarify their understanding of graphing on the Cartesian coordinate plane by contrasting it to aspects of ",275,mtms2008-05-500a,,

The use of such a context can help to facilitate students’ abstraction of the general concept of coordinate graphs (Bell and Janvier 1981).

"After graphing the hurricane paths,  students discussed characteristics of the curves they plotted, describing similarities and differences observed, in response to question 3 on activity sheet 1 (see fig. 4). Several pairs used a Venn-diagram writing strategy that they learned in their language arts classes to compare and contrast the paths. Our students recognized and discussed important attributes of the hurricane paths. They used language to organize and strengthen their mathematical thinking and communicate it coherently and clearly to others, important elements of learning as suggested in Principles and Standards for School Mathematics (NCTM 2000). ",278,mtms2008-05-500a,,
"Rates of Change in  Hurricane Tracking Our students also examined various mathematical features of the hurricane paths more closely, including changes in longitude and latitude that are analogous with changes in x- and y-values on a Cartesian coordinate plane. Although hurricanes can affect large areas along their paths, for the purposes of this lesson, our students examined the paths traveled by the center of the storm, as shown on prediction models in national weather reports. The class discussion exposed different approaches used by students for analyzing changes in the paths. Some students tended to focus more on the table of values (an analytic approach) and others on the graphs of the paths (a visual approach). ",279,mtms2008-05-500a,,
"For instance, when discussing  which days Hurricane Ingrid had no changes in latitude (question 6 on activity sheet 1), students using an analytic approach examined the table of values for Ingrid’s path (see activity sheet 1), explaining that they “looked for positions where the degrees north remained the same from one to the  next.” These included day 3, when the position of Hurricane Ingrid remained at 26° N from position 2 to 3; day 5, when it stayed at 24° N from position 4 to 5; and day 8, when it did not move from 28° N from position 7 to 8. Other students used a visual approach to find where the graph showed no change in latitude, explaining that “horizontal segments indicate a constant degree north” or “0° change up or down.” By comparing analytical with graphical approaches, students recognized that a 0° change in latitude on the table corresponded to a horizontal line on the graph and vice versa. Similarly, in response to which days Humberto had no change in latitude (question 7 on activity sheet 1), some students used the table of values and others used the graph to explain that “there were none.” Some students demonstrated an analytic tendency using the table of values and remarked, “The degrees north are always changing.” Others demonstrated a visual tendency, explaining that “the latitude is always changing as the path curves northward” and “there were no horizontal segments.” Questions 6 and 7 provided experiences with latitude that supported students’ development of the notion of zero slope on the (x, y) plane (e.g., graphs of horizontal lines). The concept of change (or no change) along one dimension (i.e., latitude) is important in many contexts and is revisited throughout a variety of mathematics classes (e.g., algebra, calculus, differential equations).",280,mtms2008-05-500a,,
"In addition, students examined and compared the hurricane paths for extents traveled on different days, lengths of distances traveled, and rates of change (e.g., velocity). For example, question 8 on activity sheet 1 asked students to compare which hurricane traveled the farthest over the first two days, Humberto or Ingrid. Again, they used various approaches. One pair that compared the change in latitude and longitude using the table of values responded, “Humberto, because it traveled 2° N, 6° W, and Ingrid traveled only 2° N, 4° W.” A different pair who referred to the graph of the paths explained, “Humberto. It traveled farther west, more boxes. But they traveled the same north.” Some pairs used both representations (see fig. 5). Such questions helped our students make connections between distances observed through tables of values and distances observed through graphs. Other questions engaged our students in analyses of the graphs of the hurricane paths to approximate distances traveled and speed of travel. Figure 6 shows a student’s responses to questions about the day with the farthest distance traveled and an approximation for that distance, questions 10(a) and (b), respectively. When determining distances traveled, as in 10(b), our students typically compared the length of the map scale with the length of the path. For 10(b), they recognized that one unit on the map scale is 500 miles, but the desired part of Humberto’s path is 1/5 longer than the scale. Thus, the distance of the path for the desired day (day 11) was about 600 miles. ",281,mtms2008-05-500a,,
"Graphing on the Tracking Map  versus the Cartesian Plane Finally, students also compared graphing on the hurricane-tracking map with graphing on a Cartesian coordinate plane with its related conventions (i.e., quadrants and points) (see questions 12(a) and (b) on activity sheet 1). Students made connections between mapping positions on the Earth’s grid to graphing on a coordinate plane, recognizing that the hurricane-tracking map represented the region of the Earth’s grid that was analogous to quadrant II of the Cartesian plane. Some students who had forgotten the quadrant numbering system referred to the textbook. ",282,mtms2008-05-500a,,

"The students equated the degree north measures on the prime meridian with the positive values on the y-axis and the degree west measures on the equator with the negative values of the x-axis. They found that hurricane positions such as 15° N, 65° W would be represented by (–65, 15) on the (x, y) plane. ",285,mtms2008-05-500a,,
Expanding Our Ways of Thinking about Mathematical Approaches,286,mtms2008-05-500a,,
"When we implemented the hurricane-tracking task with middle-grades teachers, an important discussion arose related to possible “mathematical” approaches. When discussing question 8 on activity sheet 1, one teacher proudly announced, “I did this one the mathematical way.” We were not immediately certain what she meant by “mathematical.” This teacher explained that she and her partner had subtracted the values on the table. The distance that Humberto traveled corresponded to a 2° change in longitude and a 6° change in latitude, whereas  the distance that Ingrid traveled corresponded to a 2° degree change in longitude and a 4° degree change in latitude. Thus, Humberto had traveled farther. We agreed that this method of measurement was certainly mathematical; others felt, however, that their solutions were also mathematical. ",287,mtms2008-05-500a,,
"Another teacher announced that  she had measured the distances on the map with a ruler and that Humberto’s path was longer than Ingrid’s. Someone else added that they compared the distances using the scale printed on the map. Another teacher thought using the distance formula was a better solution method. This discussion helped everyone recognize that all these solutions were mathematical and provided the same answer to question 8 that “Humberto traveled farthest over the first two days.” In this context, each approach for comparing distances traveled by each hurricane provided estimates of amounts traveled, whether in degrees, centimeters on a ruler, or miles based on the  concluding reMarks map scale. Within this context and others, each approach brings its own This article presents ideas related to merits and drawbacks. For example, students’ learning of mathematics and the distance formula is an important teachers thinking about teaching mathtool for determining length in a plane; ematics within a hurricane context. As however, in the context of the path of the middle school students in this proja hurricane, it loses precision because ect engaged in these hurricane-related of mapping the curved surface of tasks, they applied mathematical ideas in the Earth to the flat surface of the a context that piqued their curiosity and map, where direction is preserved but engaged them in making connections, distance is not. Thus, all distances that communicating mathematically, and we calculate with this data (even exact using representations in ways proposed Our students recognized that much about graphing on the (x, y) Cartesian coordinate plane is based on conventions that support mathematical communication distances computed from the coordinates) are imprecise estimations.",288,mtms2008-05-500a,,
"The teachers recognized that it was valuable to discuss different mathematical approaches as well as the merits and drawbacks of each in context. We all have our own initial approaches or strategies for solving a problem in a mathematical way, based on our understanding of the mathematics involved. It is rarely the only way and does not always align with our students’ level of understanding. In our mathematics classrooms, we teach all these mathematical ideas (i.e., measurement, estimation, distance formula, and so on). NCTM (2000) calls for students to be able to use and discriminate among the merits of different methods or strategies, given particular contexts. A class discussion with students sharing different ideas for solving these problems can help broaden their minds to alternate solutions and support their learning to discriminate among different methods. It can provide insight for the teacher into what ways the students are processing the mathematics and how they tend to approach a problem.  by NCTM (2000). These tasks helped them enhance their understanding of various algebra-related concepts, particularly constructing and interpreting graphs and analyzing patterns, through connections with science and geography.

"For the teachers with whom we  worked, these hurricane-related tasks provided a context for them to expand their thinking about the use of multiple approaches and representations for solving mathematics problems. These tasks also encouraged their thinking about pedagogical strategies for effectively engaging their students in cooperative learning. The studentteachers also developed knowledge about hurricanes that they could bring to their mathematics class.
