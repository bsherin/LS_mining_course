Students in middle school or early high school are often required to memorize the formula for the surface area of a sphere without understanding why the formula works. Flexible rods called Wikki Stix® can help students derive this formula. Wikki Stix are eight-inch bendable rods that are covered with a nontoxic wax. The rods are strong and stick to any smooth surface.,3,mtms2011-11-203a,,
"Students can derive the formula for the surface area of a sphere after covering a sphere using Wikki Stix rods and observing two facts: •	 Fact 1—The surface area of a  whole sphere is equal to the lateral surface area of a cylinder with base radius equal to the radius of the sphere and with height equal to the diameter of the sphere.  •	 Fact 2—The surface area of half a sphere is equal to the area of two great circles, that is, circles with the same radius as the sphere. ",4,mtms2011-11-203a,,
"After students cover a sphere and other shapes of known surface area using the bendable rods, they will observe that some of the shapes have the same surface area. These activities can be completed by individuals or groups. ",5,mtms2011-11-203a,,

"A cylinder, a sphere, and a half sphere are needed for the experiment. The dimensions of these three are related to one another in that the sphere and the half sphere have the same radius (see fig. 1). The base of the cylinder has the same radius as the sphere, and the height of the cylinder is equal to ",7,mtms2011-11-203a,,

Fig. 1 The sphere and half sphere have the same radius.,10,mtms2011-11-203a,,

Fig. 3 The sphere and the lateral surface of the cylinder are covered with the same number of bendable rods.,12,mtms2011-11-203a,,
"the diameter of the sphere (see fig. 2). The number of rods used will depend on the size of the sphere. For a sphere with a diameter of 3 inches, about  36 rods will be needed.",13,mtms2011-11-203a,,
Students should be familiar with some common formulas associated with circles and cylinders: •	 The	area	of	a	circle	with	radius	r : ,14,mtms2011-11-203a,,
"Ac = pr2  •	 The	lateral	surface	area	of	a	cylinder, given the radius of the base r and the height h:  AL = 2prh activity 1: sPheRe  and cylindeR",15,mtms2011-11-203a,,
"Students cover the sphere by winding the rods around it, starting at the equator and working up to the poles (see fig. 3). In theory, the same number of rods should be used to cover each half. In practice, however, some small experimental errors may occur because of tiny gaps between the rods or some squishing of the rods. Partially unwinding and rewinding the rods again may be necessary. If the number of rods used is not exactly the same, students can compute the  percentage of error. Students record how many total rods they use to cover the sphere. For example, in figure 3,  6 sticks are used for each colored band, a total of 36. Students then cover the lateral surface of the cylinder by winding the rods around it (see fig. 3). It is better to start at the middle of the cylinder and work up to the top and down to the base. ",16,mtms2011-11-203a,,
"Students will notice that they  use the same number, or almost the same number, of rods to cover the lateral surface of the cylinder as with the sphere. They should record the discrepancy, if any, and compute what percentage the discrepancy represents compared with the total surface area of the sphere. Students can compute the percentage error by comparing the difference to the total number of rods used. For example, if students cannot fit the last 2 inches of a stick, that is, 1/4 of a stick, onto the lateral surface of the cylinder, and 36 total sticks are used to cover the sphere, they can compute the percentage  error as 0.25 ÷ 36, which is less than  1 percent. ",17,mtms2011-11-203a,,
"By disregarding the small experimental error, students should realize that the same number of rods will cover the lateral surface of the cylinder and the surface of the sphere. In figure 3, each color band consists of 6 rods for both the cylinder and the sphere. Students can next describe this equality of number of rods in terms of area. They should be able to state that the surface area of the sphere is equal to the area of the lateral surface of the cylinder and be able to write an algebraic expression for the lateral surface area of the cylinder.",18,mtms2011-11-203a,,
"They should rely on their previous  knowledge to realize that the lateral surface area of the cylinder is equal to the area of a rectangle with length equal to the circumference of the base circle of the cylinder and width equal to the height of the cylinder. The  height of the cylinder for this activity is intentionally equal to the diameter of the sphere (i.e., it is twice the radius). In this case, the circumference of the base is 2pr, and the height of the cylinder is 2r. Therefore, the lateral surface area of the cylinder is 4pr2. The surface area of the sphere of radius r is thus 4pr2.",19,mtms2011-11-203a,,
activity 2: sPheRe  and gReat ciRcles,20,mtms2011-11-203a,,
"Using the half sphere, students trace four great circles on paper, cover the half sphere with the bendable rods (see the example in fig. 4), and use the same number of rods to cover two of the great circles on the paper. In this example, the half sphere is covered by 6 blue, 6 green, and 6 yellow sticks. To cover a circle, students should start at the rim and work toward the center. One circle is covered by 6 blue and 3 green sticks, and the other circle is covered by 3 green and 6 yellow sticks. Some adjustments may be necessary for the fit to be exact. Alternatively, if the fit is not quite exact, students can record how much of a stick is missing or is not used and can compute the percentage amount of experimental error.",21,mtms2011-11-203a,,
"Disregarding the small experimental error, students can verify that the number of rods covering half the sphere is equal to the number of rods covering the two great circles. Students can use their knowledge that the area of each circle is pr2 and realize that the area of half the sphere is thus 2pr2, and therefore the surface area of the whole sphere is 4pr2, the same formula obtained by the method in activity 1.

Fig. 4 Two great circles of the sphere are covered with the same number of rods as half the sphere.,24,mtms2011-11-203a,,
"students is within their reach and may be quite convincing. In so doing, they do not have to rely on an outside authority. Middle school students often believe a formula is true based solely on the authority of the teacher or the textbook (Flores 2006).",25,mtms2011-11-203a,,
"Empirical approaches to finding  the surface area of the sphere are not new. Some authors suggest activities in which students peel an orange and cover four corresponding great circles (see, for example, Lawrence and Hennessy 2007). One advantage of using Wikki Stix is that they provide a better fit, and students can estimate the percentage of experimental error. By providing students with approaches where they can either give a mathematical argument for a fact or verify it empirically, we help them expand their repertoire of justification schemes. The teacher can help students shift the authority in establishing truth in mathematics from an outside source to the students themselves. These activities provide opportunities for students in the middle grades to develop mathematical deductions on the basis of previously accepted facts. In turn, they can develop the ability to make  such deductions. In so doing, they will be better prepared for more advanced courses in which mathematical argumentation becomes more and more deductive (and be prepared for deductions that often comprise several steps).
