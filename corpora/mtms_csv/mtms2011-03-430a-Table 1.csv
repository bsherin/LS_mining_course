"In the elementary grades, students learn procedures to compute the four arithmetic operations on multidigit whole numbers, often by being shown a series of steps and rules. In the middle grades, students are then expected to perform these same procedures, with further twists. For example, to calculate 25.7 × 0.39, students are taught to compute 257 × 39. Then, the decimal point is moved three places to the left in the product. How can we help students understand why this works?",3,mtms2011-03-430a,,
The Reasoning and Proof Process Standard suggests that students need to reason about the math that they are learning to make sense of the content  (NCTM 2000). The Representation Process Standard explores the importance of creating and using representations to communicate mathematical ideas and interpret physical and mathematical phenomena. What reasoning and which representations might middle-grades students use to make sense of the procedures for multiplying decimals? ,4,mtms2011-03-430a,,

"One way to assess students’ initial conceptions of numbers and operations is to ask them to construct story problems that are appropriate for a particular arithmetic expression.

From Equal Groups to Measures,11,mtms2011-03-430a,,
"If students are limited by an equalgroups interpretation, they may fi nd it challenging to write or recognize a correct and meaningful story problem when one or both numbers are decimal fractions (Graeber and Tanenhaus 1993). For example, how would a student write a word problem about  3.2 × 0.46? Would the same format be used, as in “3.2 friends each have 0.46 of a pet”? To reason about this problem, students need to think of two groupings (the items and the groups themselves) and that each grouping can be “sectioned” into pieces. In effect, instead of counting, they must think about measuring.",12,mtms2011-03-430a,,
"What types of measures help  students attach meaning to decimal numbers? The most familiar measure involves money. For example, 0.46 could be thought of as 46 hundredths of a dollar, or 46 cents. Decimal fractions are commonly used to measure many other quantities, such as— •  distance (an odometer showed the  bicycle traveled 3.4 miles),  •  time (an athlete broke a record by  0.46 second),  •  weight (the bulk food section sold  3.4 pounds of ﬂ our), or  •  volume (I pumped 0.46 of a gallon  of gas). ",13,mtms2011-03-430a,,
"Quantities measured in customary units (feet, yards, pounds, gallons, and so on) are more familiar to learners in the United States. The base-ten structure of the metric system provides a natural connection with decimal fractions. Teachers who introduce metric ",14,mtms2011-03-430a,,

"(a) (b) units of measure can make these available as referents to decimal fractions (Bonotto 2005; Hiebert 1989). For example, 3.2 can be thought of as 3 meters and 2 decimeters; 0.46 might be thought of as 460 grams or 0.46 (or almost one-half ) kilogram. Being familiar with amounts that are measured or expressed with decimal fractions enhances students’ work with decimal operations.",16,mtms2011-03-430a,,

It takes 3.2 meters of wood dowel to make a lightweight bridge. Each meter weighs 0.46 kg. How much does the entire bridge weigh?,18,mtms2011-03-430a,,
"Although it is clear that we have 3 of the 0.46-kg pieces, it is challenging to fi nd the weight of the additional 0.2-meter portion. Students often lose track of what the 0.2 is two tenths of. Does it refer to 0.2 of a meter, a kilogram, or a 0.46-kg piece? Representations such as that shown in ﬁ gure 1 may help to distinguish the different types of units. Since each meter weighs 0.46 kg, it becomes clearer that a fraction of a meter will weigh less than 0.46 kg. Working with decimal estimation, as outlined in a section below, will help to reveal that one-tenth of 0.46 kg is 0.046 kg, and two-tenths must be double that amount, or 0.092 kg.",19,mtms2011-03-430a,,

A 1-meter length of wood weighs 3.2 kg. How much would 0.46 of a meter weigh?,21,mtms2011-03-430a,,
"Many students will think that this problem no longer involves multiplication, since the product is smaller than 3.2. Others have trouble interpreting the problem as repeated addition,  “What does it mean to add 3.2 to itself 0.46 of a time?” Whole-class discussions are helpful for students who need to air confusions and clarify their interpretations. Within these discussions, teachers can refer to diagrams like ﬁ gure 1 and use language referring to whole-number multiplication. They might say, in explanation, “Instead of fi nding 4 groups of 3 things, we are fi nding the amount in a part (0.46) of a group of 3.2 things.”",22,mtms2011-03-430a,,
From Arrays to Area,23,mtms2011-03-430a,,
"Other models, such as rectangular area diagrams, have some appealing features that can help learners make sense of decimal multiplication (Graeber and Tanenhaus 1993). Students note the similarity between tiles arranged in an array and those in equal groups (e.g., the rows represent the groups, and the columns represent the number of items in each group). If an array grouping square units is used to tile a rectangular region, students begin to appreciate the source of the familiar l × w formula for the area of a rectangle (see ﬁ g. 2). Using such models, educators may connect their students’ prior knowledge about multiplication as equal groups or arrays to an area meaning that extends to fractional factors. ",24,mtms2011-03-430a,,
"Returning to the 3.2 × 0.46 prob- lem, a student might envision a rectangular wooden plank with dimensions 3.2 meters × 0.46 meters. The student might then draw a plank and visualize its area as approximately 1.5 m2 (see ﬁ g. 3). The one-dimensional length and width (factors) are highlighted to distinguish them from the two-dimensional area (product) in this model. This feature, made explicit in the diagram, is often unclear in textbook diagrams and can lead to confusion between length units and area units (Izsak 2005).",25,mtms2011-03-430a,,

Each row of 10 small squares (shown in purple) is 0.1 of a km2, and each small square (shown in green) is 0.01 of a km2. The total shaded part  shows the area planted in beans as 8 rows, or 8 tenths of a km2, or 0.8 km2, and an additional 12 small squares that are 12 one-hundredths of a km2, or 0.12 km2. The total area would be 0.8 + 0.12 = 0.92 km2.

Consider how your students might use the interpretations of decimals and of multiplication introduced earlier to approximate the product of two decimal numbers: understanding of multiplication and the properties of multiplication, such as the distributive property.

What is happening mathematically in this algorithm?,47,mtms2011-03-430a,,
"Some students claim that the  decimal points were moved in one direction before multiplying, so they must be moved back after multiplying to compensate. This compensation explanation is, by itself, not mathematically meaningful (e.g., it does not work when adding decimal numbers). Initiate a conversation about what it really means to move the decimal point. Consider again 5.24 × 1.6. To start a discussion, the teacher might pose this question: ",48,mtms2011-03-430a,,
How are those two amounts [5.24 and 524] related to each other?,49,mtms2011-03-430a,,
"Students should be encouraged to use meanings of the numbers to justify their thinking, such as comparing $5.24 to $524.",50,mtms2011-03-430a,,
"To explain “moving the decimal point,” students evoke knowledge of multiplying and dividing by ten. When a base-ten number is multiplied by 10, each digit is promoted  to a position that has a value of one higher power of ten. ",51,mtms2011-03-430a,,
"Figure 6 shows that when a  number with a 5 in the ones place is multiplied by 10, the 5 becomes worth  10 times as much, or 50. Likewise, the 2 tenths become 20 tenths, or 2, and the 4 hundredths become 40 hundredths, or 4 tenths, or 0.4. We want students to realize that the digits in the numeral are moving, not the decimal point. This idea can be demonstrated in the classroom with transparencies by putting the place-value slots on one (lower) transparency and the digits on an overlay (upper transparency). To multiply by 10, all the digits are promoted one space left by sliding the upper transparency so that each digit moves up one place.",52,mtms2011-03-430a,,
The following calculation is hidden  inside the first part of the standard algorithm (multiplying 524 by 16): (5.24 × 100) × (1.6 × 10)  = 524 × 16 = 8384,53,mtms2011-03-430a,,
"It explains how whole numbers are produced from decimal factors. The resulting product is too big by a factor of 100 × 10, so we need to divide the product by 100 and again by 10. Here, we demote each numeric digit in 8384 by a power of 10 for each division by 10. We need to do that three times (two times for each factor of 10 in 100 and once for the one factor of 10 in 10) to find the product of 5.24 × 1.6 = 8.384.",54,mtms2011-03-430a,,
"Although this explanation tells more than the rule “multiply whole numbers and move the decimal point,” I have found that students are better able to justify why the values make sense when their explanations rely on various contexts and interpretations of the decimal factors and of multiplication.

"Scaling Groups Up and Down One explanation for the decimal multiplication algorithm relies on the familiar equal-groups interpretation. The problem 5.24 × 1.6 could be understood as 5.24 bags that have  1.6 kg of potatoes in each bag. Because fractional bags are difficult to imagine, we might consider 524 bags with 16 kg of potatoes in each bag, which is 524 × 16 = 8384 kg. But we only have 1.6 kg, which is one-tenth of the 16 kg we calculated, so 8384 kg is 10 times as big as it should be, or 838.4 kg.

Then the denominators are multiplied (100 × 10), and that product is placed in the denominator.

Changing the Size of Units,71,mtms2011-03-430a,,
"An approach that connects with renaming decimals as fractions is to change the size of units to one-tenth, one-hundredth, or one-thousandth of the original so that the same numerical amounts are represented but with different unit names. ",72,mtms2011-03-430a,,
"In the garden example, instead of  changing the dimensions of the 5.24 m × 1.6 m garden, we can write the same dimensions as whole numbers by changing the units of measure:  524 cm × 160 cm = 83,840 cm2. ",73,mtms2011-03-430a,,
"Measuring 524 cm is equivalent to 524 hundredths (524/100) of a meter, and 160 cm is equivalent to 160 hundredths (160/100) of a meter. The resulting whole-number product (524 × 160) represents the number of cm2 in the garden. As 10,000 of these (cm2) area units fi t inside a 1 m2 area, we would need to divide 83,840 by 10,000 to yield the area in square meters, 8.384 m2.

deePening UndeRstanding,75,mtms2011-03-430a,,
"When middle school students represent and reason about decimal numbers and multiplication, they are less likely to memorize and quickly forget  isolated mathematical procedures. Instead, they are able to construct a connected web of relationships among mathematical ideas and processes. By introducing referents for decimal numbers, learners connect multiple representations for the same amount, such as decimal notation (0.347), currency (almost 35 cents), metric measurement (0.347 meter, or 347 millimeters), and fraction notation (a little more than 1/3). Through discussion of several robust interpretations of multiplication (equal measures, area, and scalar multiplication), students construct meanings for the operation that make sense with decimals and fractions. Simultaneously, they enhance their multiplicative thinking and understanding of geometry and measurement. Other mathematical concepts (estimation, base-ten place value, and the distributive property) are interwoven as students develop their solution methods. ",76,mtms2011-03-430a,,
