11,The Great Mathematician Project,"Sabrina R. Goldberg tThe Great Mathematician Project  (GMP) introduces both mathematically sophisticated and struggling students to the history of mathematics. This endeavor helps students develop literacy about mathematics as a scientifi c discipline and about mathematicians as research scientists. The project was originally designed to accommodate the special learning needs of gifted and talented students in a homogeneous school setting. However, it has been successfully adapted and implemented in a setting that values social and emotional learning, innovation, collaboration, and technology. This project’s expanded purpose directly addresses NCTM’s Equity Principle (NCTM 2000). ",11,The Great Mathematician Project
12,The Great Mathematician Project,The GMP is based on the ,12,The Great Mathematician Project
13,The Great Mathematician Project,"Autonomous Learner (AL) model developed by George Betts to differentiate a curriculum for gifted and talented students (Betts and Kercher 1999). The Autonomous Learner model views the teacher as a facilitator and students as self-directed learners. In addition, the AL model emphasizes communication, collaboration, and consultation between teacher-as-facilitator and student. ",13,The Great Mathematician Project
14,The Great Mathematician Project,"The rationale for the GMP is twofold. First, mathematics is a uniquely people-centered discipline that is used, in part, to make sense of the world around us. For instance, we use  mathematics to communicate, problem solve, measure, and barter. Second, students often express curiosity about the history of mathematics. They want to know how mathematical concepts and  the great Mathematician Project differentiates instruction",14,The Great Mathematician Project
15,The Great Mathematician Project,"A diverse population of students is provided with laptop computers to optimize their learning. In so doing, the GMP affords curricular differentiation through both content choice and students’ access. Content is— •	 accelerated	or	advanced	and	 contains a higher degree of complexity; •	 introduced	that	goes	beyond	the	 prescribed curriculum; and •	 selected	according	to	students’	 interest.",15,The Great Mathematician Project
16,The Great Mathematician Project,Students are given the opportunity to— •	 work	on	abstract	concepts; •	 create	or	generate	something	new;	 •	 work	on	personal	growth; •	 acquire	sophistication	in	attitude;	 and  •	 learn	to	appreciate	feelings.,16,The Great Mathematician Project
17,The Great Mathematician Project,"procedures evolved, where math symbols came from, and what purpose math holds. Students also express curiosity about careers in mathematics-related fields, such as engineering and technology. Because the history of mathematics is so vast and students’ interests so varied, the GMP validates a broad range of middle school students’ intellectual interests and developmental needs. Therefore, a key goal of the GMP is to expand how students think about and experience learning mathematics. ",17,The Great Mathematician Project
18,The Great Mathematician Project,"The notion of expanding students’  conceptual views of mathematics is warranted. Researchers have found that girls begin to shy away from mathematics in the middle grades because of gender role stereotypes and other factors (Linver, Davis-Kean, and ",18,The Great Mathematician Project
19,The Great Mathematician Project,"Eccles 2002). Walker (2009) notes that in high school, minority students are often discouraged from pursuing higher mathematics because the social aspects of learning mathematics are not adequately addressed. This research is significant. It validates not only my experience but also the importance of offering opportunities for individual inquiry and social interaction. ",19,The Great Mathematician Project
20,The Great Mathematician Project,"These experiences empower  students to make connections among famous historical figures in mathematics, science, and technology. When middle school students explore how individuals from historically underrepresented groups have made substantive contributions to mathematics and science, their views expand. They also learn how sexism and racism have challenged famous mathematicians and scientists alike. ",20,The Great Mathematician Project
21,The Great Mathematician Project,"Students also develop insight into how historical figures in mathematics and science have coped with adversity. This knowledge benefits all students as they develop empathy and an appreciation for the processes of collaboration and innovation that characterize the work of mathematicians and scientists. Moreover, students are free to imagine new possibilities in mathematics and science. In addition to writing a formal research paper for the GMP, seventhgrade students use technology as a tool to become “visions of possibility” (Greene 2000) as they explain the circumstances that led to a mathematical discovery or innovation. The seven stages of the GMP are described below (see also table 1).",21,The Great Mathematician Project
22,The Great Mathematician Project,stage 1: PRe-assessMent,22,The Great Mathematician Project
23,The Great Mathematician Project,"The teacher assesses students’ prior mathematical learning experiences. Students complete several activities including a mathematics biography,  or mathography; a mathematics questionnaire (Borasi and Siegel 2000) that targets students’ experiences with specific mathematics teaching  methods and learning strategies; and a GMP student interest survey that asks students to identify a mathematical concept, procedure, or innovation that they would like to study in depth. These student writings provide insights into their interests and dispositions toward learning mathematics.  stage 2: gMP leaRning contRact",23,The Great Mathematician Project
24,The Great Mathematician Project,"This document outlines the basic requirements for the GMP, provides due dates for written assignments, and lists previously researched historical figures. Because students’ responses to the pre-assessment writing prompts have provided information, the teacher can offer suggestions as students begin selecting a historical figure to research. Students are given two weeks to examine several historical figures in the fields of mathematics, science, and technology before making a final decision and signing the GMP learning contract. Because every student researches a different historical figure, students often race to hand in signed contracts to lock in their first choice of mathematician.  stage 3: indePendent inQUiRY",24,The Great Mathematician Project
25,The Great Mathematician Project,"Students amass 40–75 facts from books and Internet resources, then begin the process of composing the research paper. Student inquiry encompasses the following categories:  •  Biographical data (e.g., place and date of birth, family background, siblings, and other pertinent facts); •  Educational background (formal and informal; significant relatives, mentors, or internships); •  Professional life; •  Influence on a body of knowledge;  and •  Global applications of the   subject’s work in the real world (past, present, and future).",25,The Great Mathematician Project

39,The Great Mathematician Project,"Students use digital media to optimize the GMP learning experience. First, they learn about social network theory (Daly 2010) and connectivism, the latter described as a theory for learning in the digital age (Siemens 2004). The rationale for integrating a GMP social network is to increase students’ digital literacy and exposure to the big ideas that underlie social network theory. They also identify core themes of complexity in the GMP social network. By investigating social network theory, students develop an understanding of the relationship between technology and social media that are used in the real world and popular culture, such as Facebook and MySpace®. ",39,The Great Mathematician Project
40,The Great Mathematician Project,"Through an examination of social networks, students are empowered to analyze similarities, connections, and possible relationships among historical figures. They then apply this knowledge when completing a series of tiered tasks that require technology integration. These tasks emphasize the process of learning and provide challenges that are tailored to individual students within the mixed-ability classroom (Tomlinson 1995). The tasks also enable students to synthesize, analyze, and interpret connections among famous historical figures in the GMP social network. Students create digital profiles for the historical figures that they researched on the social network site. It is important to note that up to this point, student inquiry has occurred outside of math class and has been kept top secret from peers. ",40,The Great Mathematician Project
41,The Great Mathematician Project,"To enlarge on the digital profiles of their historical figures, students log on to the GMP social network using the name of the historical figure that they researched. Students assume the avatar of their historical figure to begin the  process of listing skills, interests, and factual associations that are embedded in the research paper (see ﬁ g. 1). The process of creating tags to link each historical fi gure requires specifi c and descriptive language. Excitement is palpable as students spontaneously collaborate, discover connections among one another, and consult with each other to determine others’ avatars in the GMP social network. ",41,The Great Mathematician Project
42,The Great Mathematician Project,"Students also create concept maps (see ﬁ g. 2a) with an Inspiration® application to illustrate how their subject is linked to other mathematicians, theorists, scientists, and inventors in the GMP social network (e.g., by gender, university affi liation, nationality, religion, area of mathematical or scientifi c expertise). ",42,The Great Mathematician Project
43,The Great Mathematician Project,"As students blog about their  observations and connections to each other in the GMP social network (November 2009), they are applying higher-level thinking skills. Blogging enhances their literacy about the subject that they have researched and boosts each student’s ability to articulate his or her selected GMP research topic (see ﬁ g. 2b). ",43,The Great Mathematician Project
44,The Great Mathematician Project,"After blogging, technology is  further integrated into the research enterprise as students are challenged to design an infographic or a visual display of data associated with their subject. To create an infographic, students view assorted designs that are thematic or referential in nature, such as gapminder.org® (Rosling, Rönnlund, and Rosling 2005). They also view suggested tutorials on infographic designs online. Students have successfully designed infographics in a Wordle™ format using Tagxedo applications. Because a strong emphasis is placed on integrating technology, middle school students tend to be technologically savvy and generally embrace opportunities to learn how to integrate new technological innovations.

49,The Great Mathematician Project,"Students orally present their fi ndings to their classmates in preparation for the GMP exposition at stage 6. These oral presentations serve several practical purposes. First and foremost, they provide an opportunity for the teacheras-facilitator to assess and students to refi ne oral presentation skills in advance. Second, oral presentations give everyone a chance to complement, question, or critique peers. Third, students are often too busy at the GMP expo fi elding questions or engaging in constructive problem solving to actually listen to one another present their work. ",49,The Great Mathematician Project
50,The Great Mathematician Project,"Students also prepare hands-on  mathematics activities for school buddies, middle school peers, and adults who attend the GMP expo. These problem-solving activities are meant to enhance the student’s oral presentations; show how the historical fi gures might have used mathematics to problem solve; or demonstrate how the historical fi gures applied a mathematical formula, innovation, or idea. The process of creating such activities for the GMP expo varies from student to student. Generally, it begins as soon as the fi nal draft of the research paper is completed",50,The Great Mathematician Project
51,The Great Mathematician Project,"Although some students immediately know what they want to  do, others may require more support creating mathematics activities for the expo. Bearing this in mind, all students confer with the teacher-as-facilitator about the selection of a strand of mathematics (e.g., number sense and operations, algebraic expressions and equations, geometry, measurement, statistics and probability) to incorporate in their presentation. When necessary, the teacher scaffolds stage 5 by providing resources for the student to adapt or modify for the expo. ",51,The Great Mathematician Project
52,The Great Mathematician Project,"For example, imagine that a student  has studied a number theorist who worked with advanced calculus. The student is not expected to know how to solve integral or differential calculus problems, but she becomes a mathematician by using a strand of mathematics that has been mastered and that is within her comfort zone (i.e., fractions, rates, ratios, percentages, proportions). Because of this, at the GMP expo students are empowered to share conceptual knowledge and explain the historical context in which mathematical concepts like trigonometry, calculus, and topology evolved. Students are prepared to explain how, for example, calculus is used in the real world because they are invested in being successful. In this dynamic way, the student exhibits ownership of the subject matter, becomes the teacher, and is empowered through self-directed learning to articulate what he or she has learned as they “fl ip teach” (November 2009) at the GMP expo.  stage 6: the gMP eXPo",52,The Great Mathematician Project
53,The Great Mathematician Project,"For this culminating event, students assume the persona of the historical fi gure researched and present their work dressed in costume at a grand exhibition of their work.

57,The Great Mathematician Project,"GMP expo illustrates how students are inspired to shape the fi nal project to their specifi c interests. For example, in addition to reciting key research facts, the student who assumed the avatar of John Miller, inventor of roller coasters, showed a video simulation of a roller coaster ride from the passengers’ perspective, discussed g-forces, and provided mathematics problems related to the measurement of distance and gravitational force. Other examples include the following: •  John Venn provided logic problems  for his audience to solve using Venn diagrams to categorize data.",57,The Great Mathematician Project

66,The Great Mathematician Project,"Guests at the GMP expo actively solve problems and informally evaluate presenters. After the GMP expo, students complete self-assessments and refl ect on the experience. They also receive a summative evaluation, which documents their performance throughout each stage of the GMP research process. The summative evaluation, or grading rubric, has been adapted from template designs offered by Wiggins and McTighe (1998). ",66,The Great Mathematician Project
67,The Great Mathematician Project,"From the introduction of the GMP project to its culmination at the  expo, independent inquiry is conducted outside of school. However, support is provided on an individual basis at school during study hall periods and by appointment when the teacher is available to provide guidance or special resources. In addition, students’ presentations adhere to the format for all oral presentations that are showcased across the seventh-grade curriculum. The oral presentations are tweaked in class before the GMP expo. ",67,The Great Mathematician Project
68,The Great Mathematician Project,"The amount of time that students  spend editing independent research varies, depending on their individual research topics and learning strengths. For example, students who fail to make baseline requirements receive support from the classroom teacher and learning specialist on an as-needed basis. On the other hand, students peer edit blogs before fi nal submission on the computer. From beginning to end, the  project is conducted in tandem with the core curriculum, as a form of academic enrichment. The GMP spans approximately six to seven months from start to finish. ",68,The Great Mathematician Project
69,The Great Mathematician Project,"Since its inception fifteen years  ago, the spectrum of historical figures researched for the GMP has broadened in response to students’ interests and suggestions. Initially, gifted and talented students at Hunter College Elementary School were assigned mathematicians from antiquity to research without the benefit of choice. However, as the GMP evolved, the selection of mathematicians grew to encompass famous scientists, technological innovators, engineers, architects, and inventors. ",69,The Great Mathematician Project
70,The Great Mathematician Project,"As the population of students  became more culturally and ethnically diverse, so too did the roster of historical figures. Social network theory also transformed the GMP from a biographical research report into a connected knowledge community (Daly 2010; Siemens 2004).",70,The Great Mathematician Project
71,The Great Mathematician Project,"The only caveat that has not  changed is that every student is required to integrate a strand of mathematics for problem solving at the GMP expo. Students have embraced the GMP whether or not they have been grouped by ability. As a result, the Great Mathematician Project boosts students’ research skills and confidence in public speaking. It has also increased students’ understanding of how mathematics is used in the real world. Stu-dents’ self-assessments and reflections on the GMP are impassioned yet varied, despite the hard work that was required:  “Very creative and free project with a lot of options, very fun and cool to set up poster board. . . . Challenges include editing writing and coming up with problems which little kids could solve. Highlights include it being fun and the best project all year.” “I loved learning about a person that I knew close to nothing about. It expanded my knowledge of the history and mathematics related to my own person, and I learned about other great mathematicians. Furthermore, the GMP helped my presenting skills and I got to learn and laugh as different age groups made comments on my costume, the fact that I couldn’t be dead if I was standing there talking to them, etc. Overall, it was a great learning experience.” “There were definitely some challenges. Writing the essay took some effort, but I learned how to write a wellstructured essay with MLA citations. I feel like l learned a lot of English and writing skills in math class. The GMP was a great project idea!” “It was a very challenging process, but when I was finished, I felt really good about myself.”",71,The Great Mathematician Project
72,The Great Mathematician Project,The most important result of the GMP is that it has ignited students’ imagination and has empowered them to envision professional possibilities in mathematics and science. ,72,The Great Mathematician Project
