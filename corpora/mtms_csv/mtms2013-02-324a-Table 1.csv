"As a political advocacy position, STEM is of critical importance to the health of the mathematics and science education communities. In this arena, STEM makes perfect sense. It is when the term “STEM” ﬁ lters down to states, districts, schools, and pre-K–12 teaching that the waters can become muddled. (Shaughnessy 2012)",120,mtms2013-02-324a,,
"In one of my ﬁ nal President’s Messages to the NCTM membership, I wrote about the strengths and potential weaknesses of the STEM movement in our country. The piece mentioned the potential power of STEM education to attract future generations of students to science, mathematics, and engineering, but also warned about programs that are only a STEM veneer, approaches that do not truly integrate the disciplines, and which may be devoid of signiﬁ cant mathematical work for our students. ",121,mtms2013-02-324a,,
"Working deﬁ nitions for and beliefs  about STEM abound and are quite varied. STEM could just mean “strong experiences in math, science, and technology” as separate disciplines. Or STEM might refer to the integration of the four disciplines in a carefully designed curriculum. Given that there are already numerous meanings and ",122,mtms2013-02-324a,,
"Context deﬁ nitions of STEM, let me offer my own deﬁ nition of STEM education.",123,mtms2013-02-324a,,
STEM education refers to solving problems that draw on concepts and procedures from mathematics and science while incorporating the teamwork and design methodology of engineering and using appropriate technology. ,124,mtms2013-02-324a,,
"From an NCTM perspective, STEM education must involve signiﬁ cant mathematics for students. Otherwise, the M in STEM is silent. If we are going to promote STEM education, as mathematics teachers we must make the mathematics transparent and explicit. We cannot just assume that everyone will “see” the mathematics that is involved in a particular problem. The M in STEM will remain silent for our colleagues unless we clearly shine the light on the mathematics. I see three necessary ingredients for any STEM activity:  1.  There must be a problem to solve.",125,mtms2013-02-324a,,
2.  There must be signiﬁ cant mathematics involved in the problem. 3.  The problem should require the teamwork that draws on knowledge and approaches from several disciplines. ,126,mtms2013-02-324a,,
"In this issue of MTMS, the authors present six potential examples of STEM education activities. Each article involves a problem that includes important mathematics while drawing on concepts and processes from several disciplines. The activities described in articles include building a robot, playing a battleship-like game, designing a staircase, analyzing crystalline-structure data, constructing weight-bearing tables out of paper, and designing a skate park. The mathematics in the articles spans measurement, data analysis, Cartesian coordinates, proportional reasoning, linear functions, and transformational geometry—topics that are central to the middle-grades curriculum and STEM-related ﬁ elds.",127,mtms2013-02-324a,,
"I applaud the efforts of the authors  of this special MTMS Focus Issue, and I thank the MTMS Editorial Panel for their development of this issue on STEM education activities.",128,mtms2013-02-324a,,
