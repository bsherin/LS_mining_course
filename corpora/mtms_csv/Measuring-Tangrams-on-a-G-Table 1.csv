0,Measuring Tangrams on a Geoboard - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Many of us are familiar with the tangram and the geoboard. A tangram is a dissection puzzle consisting of seven flat shapes. One objective of the puzzle is to form a specified shape using all seven pieces, with no pieces overlapping. Geoboards are generally used to explore basic concepts found in plane geometry, such as perimeter and area, or basic shapes, such as polygons. Using tangrams in combination with a geoboard provides a rich activity for students that will help them further develop their skills and understanding of operations and algebraic thinking, number and operations, measurement, and geometry, also mentioned in the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSM) (CCSSI 2010).",,
1,Measuring Tangrams on a Geoboard - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I originally developed this activity for my preservice elementary school teachers. The purpose was to give them practice working with irrational numbers, specifically square roots, and to practice using a ruler to measure in both English and metric units. In previous lessons, students had been introduced to rational and irrational numbers, so they understood that the square root of whole numbers between perfect squares were irrational numbers. Students were also familiar with basic fractional relationships found among the tangram pieces. Thus, the purpose of this activity was not to introduce students to these elements but to further their understanding of rational and irrational numbers and to foster their reasoning about mathematics using a geoboard in combination with a tangram. Although I presented this activity to preservice teachers, the activity could also be used with eighth graders who are familiar with the concepts noted above. In this activity, students use all seven tangram pieces (called tans) to create a square and then reconstruct the square on the geoboard (see fig. 1).",,

3,Measuring Tangrams on a Geoboard - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,The distance between two consecutive horizontal or vertical pegs is calculated using a ruler and measuring in both English and metric units. These measurements are then used to calculate the perimeters and areas of the seven tans. Students enter the perimeters and areas into a table and look for patterns and relationships based on their calculations (see the activity sheet).,,

5,Measuring Tangrams on a Geoboard - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,BEGINNING THE ACTIVITY,,
6,Measuring Tangrams on a Geoboard - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Give pairs of students a 5 peg  5 peg geoboard (the standard geoboard used at the elementary school level) and a copy of the activity sheet, and ask them to complete question 1. They are to work with a partner to measure the horizontal or vertical distance between consecutive pegs and list measurements in both inches and centimeters. After the measurements are recorded, hold a class discussion so that there is agreement on the measurements to use for the remaining part of the activity. Note that it is helpful to have class discussion about the differences in measurements because some students will measure from the middle of one peg to the middle of another peg, whereas other students will measure from the outside of the pegs. Two of the Standards for Mathematical Practice have been employed at this point in the activity: using appropriate tools strategically and attending to precision.",,
7,Measuring Tangrams on a Geoboard - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Once the distance between two horizontal or vertical pegs has been calculated (for our geoboards, generally 1 3/8 inches and 3 1/2 cm are used), ask students to use the Pythagorean theorem to determine the exact diagonal distance between two consecutive pegs.",,
8,Measuring Tangrams on a Geoboard - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Students might also recall the relationship between the sides of an isosceles right triangle to calculate the length of the diagonal. I require students to use fractions rather than decimals in their calculations so that they can practice simplifying radicals containing fractions. Similarly, ask them to work with exact values rather than approximate values because many students will round the values. Using exact values will also make it easier for students to identify patterns in the table.",,
9,Measuring Tangrams on a Geoboard - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Ask students to answer questions 2 and 3 on the activity sheet, forming a square using all seven tans. Although students have had previous practice with the seven tans, it is always a challenge for them to put the pieces together to form a square. Once they have completed the square, ask them to recreate it on the geoboard (see fig. 1) and also draw it on their geoboard dot paper for reference. Ask students to complete questions 2a and 2b, finding perimeters and areas of the entire figure as well as the individual pieces displayed on the geoboard. In calculating the total perimeters, students are given practice combining like terms and adding radicals. Also, having students calculate both the total perimeter and area along with the sum of the perimeters and areas of the individual pieces allows them to recognize conservation of area (area of the whole is the sum of the areas of the parts), but perimeter is not conserved because of the addition of the inside lengths.",,
10,Measuring Tangrams on a Geoboard - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Question 4 on the activity sheet asks students to describe patterns among the values in the table and state any relationships observed among the seven tans based on answers to previous parts. When area is involved, students will generally discuss percentages and ratios of the areas of individual tans to the largest square comprising all seven tans. Below is one students observations about the area:",,
11,Measuring Tangrams on a Geoboard - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I observed a lot of ratios and percentages. The two large triangles are 50% of the entire square, this makes the ratio of both of the large triangles to the square 2:1. If you just look at 1 large triangle, it is 25% of the whole square and the ratio for that is 4:1 because it takes 4 large triangles to fill one square. Comparing the medium triangle to the large triangle, I found that the medium triangle is 50% of the large triangle. The ratio of the medium triangle to the large triangle is 2:1 because it takes 2 medium triangles to fill one large triangle. I found the same for the medium and small triangle. The small triangle is 50% of the medium triangle and also has a 2:1 ratio where it takes two small triangles to fill a medium triangle. I also found that the medium triangle, square and parallelogram all have the same area. Their ratio would be 1:1:1 because they are equal. Knowing the area of the whole square made finding the area of the different shapes easier when you apply the percentages and ratios to them. For example, it was easy to find the area of the large triangle because you can take the area of the whole large square and divide it by 2 since there is a 2:1 ratio and the two large triangles are 50% of the square. Then take that number and divide by 2 again to get the area of the single (large) triangle. You can do this or something similar for all the shapes.",,
12,Measuring Tangrams on a Geoboard - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Although these observations could easily be based on previous experiences in working with tans, this activity provides an opportunity for students to see that the numbers they calculated from their measurements match what they expect. For instance, when measuring in inches and finding 1 3/8 (or 11/8) inches between two consecutive horizontal or vertical pegs, the large triangle will have an area of 121/16 in.2, which is one-fourth the area of the largest square on the geoboard. The area of the largest square on the geoboard using all seven tans is 121/4 in.2. Calculating the ratio of the area of the whole square to the area of the large triangle gives a 4:1 ratio.",,
13,Measuring Tangrams on a Geoboard - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,It is important for students to realize that there are no relationships among the perimeters of the individual tans to the whole perimeter. They will observe this fact through their calculations. One student made the following observation:,,
14,Measuring Tangrams on a Geoboard - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"My total perimeters in the chart were not equal to the original perimeter measurement because my measurement in #2 was only calculating the perimeter around the square whereas my chart showed perimeter around each individual piece, therefore the numbers are higher.",,
15,Measuring Tangrams on a Geoboard - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Although no relationships exist among the perimeters of the individual tans to the whole perimeter, interesting relationships are found among the individual pieces. One student described perimeter relationships among the individual pieces algebraically in this way:",,

23,Measuring Tangrams on a Geoboard - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
24,Measuring Tangrams on a Geoboard - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Algebraic relationships also exist among the areas of the tans, but the student only stated an algebraic relationship among the perimeters of the pieces. The algebraic relationships hold whether working in inches or centimeters because of the geometric relationship among the tans. One can see in the algebraic expressions above that the student was able to use the patterns in the table to look for and make use of structure, which is another of CCSSMs Standards for Mathematical Practice. The student further observed:",,
25,Measuring Tangrams on a Geoboard - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,The large triangles perimeter is twice as large as the small triangles perimeter. All except the square is a multiple of 11/8 plus the quantity of a multiple of,,
26,Measuring Tangrams on a Geoboard - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
27,Measuring Tangrams on a Geoboard - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,when it comes to inches.,,
28,Measuring Tangrams on a Geoboard - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Not all students were able to describe their observations, as seen in the following students statement:",,
29,Measuring Tangrams on a Geoboard - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,The way the triangles increase is a pattern.,,
30,Measuring Tangrams on a Geoboard - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
31,Measuring Tangrams on a Geoboard - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Here the student provided no indication of the pattern formed. It is important to allow time for class discussion of the observations made so that all students are able to understand the relationships among the perimeters of the individual tans.,,
32,Measuring Tangrams on a Geoboard - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"No students calculated the ratio of the sum of the individual perimeters to the outside perimeter, but whether using inches or centimeters in the calculation, the ratio is",,
33,Measuring Tangrams on a Geoboard - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
34,Measuring Tangrams on a Geoboard - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"This is the ratio found when using a slightly different measurement between two consecutive horizontal or vertical pegs, such as 3 3/5 cm versus 3 1/2 cm. Hold a discussion about why the ratio is not dependent on the units of measurement or the measurement used to help students understand the concept of ratio versus percentage, especially since many students used both ratio and percentage to describe area relationships.",,
35,Measuring Tangrams on a Geoboard - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Although this activity contains no extensions, students can be asked to consider whether the size of the geoboard poses a possible restriction in creating a square using the seven tans. The original activity used a 5 peg  5 peg geoboard. Is it possible to create a square using the seven tans on a 6 peg  6 peg geoboard? What about a 7 peg  7 peg geoboard? These questions could be explored using an interactive geoboard, such as that found at http://nlvm.usu.edu/en/nav/frames_asid_172_g_2_t_3.html (NLVM 2016).",,
36,Measuring Tangrams on a Geoboard - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"This activity allows students to work with both tangrams and geoboards in a manner that is different from what may typically be done using these manipulatives. Although it is possible that area and perimeter relationships could be observed without it, I believe that the geoboard provided a better platform for students because the rubber bands define the pieces on the board and are easy to move. The activity itself engages students in several of the Standards for Mathematical Practice and addresses many of the standards outlined in CCSSM by enabling students to practice measuring with a ruler, performing operations with radicals, making connections among geometric shapes, and identifying patterns to form algebraic expressions.",,
