"Problem solving can be taught in three distinct ways: Teaching about, teaching for, and teaching through problem solving (Schroeder and Lester 1989). Teaching about problem solving explores instruction focused on the processes used and strategies chosen, such as working backward or solving a simpler problem. Teaching for problem solving refers to the use of knowledge in application. Textbooks that employ this approach typically contain several numerical exercises followed by word problems where the skill is applied. This format may foster the perception that mathematics and problem solving are separate (Grischenko 2009). Teaching through problem solving typically begins with a concrete problem, sometimes characterized as a rich task. A rich task embodies one or more mathematics concepts, has the potential to engage students in complex forms of reasoning, and positions students to make sense of the problem’s contextual situation and the underlying mathematical concepts and procedures. As  students share their ideas for solving the problem, the teacher scaffolds students’ learning through questioning and discussion. As students participate in classroom discussions, they are articulating relevant mathematical concepts and skills.",3,mtms2012-12-262A,,
"A model-eliciting activity (MEA)  is one type of rich task that can be used to teach through problem solving. Like other rich tasks, MEAs embody one or more mathematical concepts and have the potential to engage students in complex forms of reasoning. Rich tasks typically involve scenarios that both motivate and interest students. They are open tasks, which means that they may be solved in multiple ways. These specialized tasks encompass these components, but, in addition, they have the distinct aim of promoting modeling.",4,mtms2012-12-262A,,

"In June, the Chicago Spanish Club is going on a study-abroad trip to Venezuela. It has hired your team to help them select which airline to fly. Last year, the club had a miserable experience when traveling to Barcelona. The connecting flight to Reykjavik, Iceland, was late, so the group missed its next flight to Barcelona. The entire class had to spend the night in the airport. Club members have identified five  airlines with economical fares that fly from O’Hare International Airport to Venezuela, but they are still in the process of identifying more airlines that fly to their destination. Most of the flights have a connecting flight in Mexico City. They are hoping to find the airline that has the smallest chance of departing late from O’Hare so that they are less likely to arrive late in Mexico City. They do not want to miss their one connecting flight to Venezuela this year.",12,mtms2012-12-262A,,

As you rank the airlines, keep track of your process.

"They are able to identify important quantities in a practical situation and map their relationships using such tools as diagrams, two-way tables, graphs, flowcharts and formulas. They can analyze those relationships mathematically to draw  conclusions. They routinely interpret their  mathematical results in the context of the situation and reflect on whether the results make sense, possibly improving the model if it has not served its purpose.

an MEA. It also implies what instruction would involve when modeling is an instructional goal. ,34,mtms2012-12-262A,,
"The MEA shown in figure 1,  called Departing on Time, asks students to rank airlines on the basis of their departure time. The first feature of MEAs is an expectation that problem solvers should develop an initial model that draws on some of the data. This initial model identifies important quantities and characterizes possible relations between them. For example, one model might be a bar graph displaying the largest and smallest amount of delay for each airline.",35,mtms2012-12-262A,,
"A second feature of MEAs is that there are several viable models. This example activity could be solved using models that deal with different features within the data. Each model highlights unique mathematical elements, operations, or relationships. Students can use these distinct models to better examine mathematical relationships within the problem. For example, one student’s model might capture each airline’s average number of minutes late and the statistical range of number of minutes late.",36,mtms2012-12-262A,,
"A third feature of MEAs is that  students are expected to translate between mathematical representations (e.g., a graph and an equation, text and a diagram, as well as a table and a graph) to draw conclusions. Solving this activity requires working fluently with a table listing information,   sentences describing the problem,  and models ranking the airlines.",37,mtms2012-12-262A,,
"A fourth feature of MEAs is that the initial model can be improved so that it effectively captures more of the mathematical nuances within the problem’s situation. This feature encourages individuals to re-engage in modeling with mathematics and determine whether the model is sufficient. In this problem, students might initially draw a bar graph, with the mathematical average and range for each airline, and later refine the average after excluding any outliers within the data set. Teachers can press this issue by asking students whether the model could be better.  Reexamining and improving the model to fully characterize a   problem’s situation captures the essence of modeling and is highlighted in instruction using MEAs. ",38,mtms2012-12-262A,,
A fifth feature found in all MEAs  is that problem solvers are expected to communicate their results using everyday language. Describing the process of ranking the airlines pushes students to explain their thinking and further reflect on their models. The solution for this MEA includes two components: an accurate model and a description of the modeling process.  cReating Model-eliciting actiVities,39,mtms2012-12-262A,,
"Current textbook materials may not provide problems that fit the criteria of MEAs, but teachers can alter textbook problems so that they become MEAs. The Pizza problem in figure 2 was developed for sixthgrade students who were learning about ratios, rates, proportions, and  data analysis (Bostic 2011). A goal of this activity was for students to create accurate models of a real-life data set to help someone choose a pizza. First, the teacher examined the mathematics Content Standards. He chose one Standard and unpacked what students were expected to learn during a lesson aligned with that Standard.",40,mtms2012-12-262A,,
"He then chatted with students  about their interests and their experiences to learn about contexts that they perceived to be realistic. Students were familiar with renting movies online, attending theme parks, buying pizza at local restaurants, analyzing U.S. weather patterns, and following well-known athletes (such as Tim Tebow). With these contexts in mind, the teacher examined the textbook (Larson and Boswell 2010) for a context and problem that could be adapted into an MEA. One task read, “You pay $27 for 3 pizzas.” It included  a picture of three pizzas and asked students to translate that verbal statement into a ratio and unit rate using symbolic representations (Larson and Boswell 2010, p. 198). Using pizza as a realistic and relevant context for the sixth graders, the teacher set out to modify this exercise and turn it into an MEA.",41,mtms2012-12-262A,,

Next, the teacher supplemented the original task with additional questions that required higher-level reasoning. For instance, students needed to find the smallest ratio describing the cost of one slice of cheese pizza and to think about appropriate ways to describe the data set (i.e., what is the average value for a large pepperoni pizza?). With these changes, students were expected to draw on their feelings about pizza from their restaurant experiences, as well as use mathematical reasoning to answer the question.

"After students created their initial models, they both reflected on and refined them. The teacher then pushed students to refine their initial models during the problem-solving phase. After students expressed confidence with their models, they presented both models and solutions to the whole class. Students later shared their knowledge with family and friends.

Implementing an MEA during instruction is best when students are prepared to explore a task over multiple class periods and know how to work together. Here are some guidelines and tips:  •	 Plan	for	at	least	two	forty-fiveminute class periods. Try not to rush students’ thinking. Allow time for students to develop and revise their models.  •	 Establish	and	maintain	appropriate	 expectations for working collaboratively while problem solving. ,61,mtms2012-12-262A,,
"For example, this expectation was stated in the sixth-grade classroom where students worked on the Pizza problem: “If we disagree with someone, we will ask a question about his or her idea and describe why we disagree” (Bostic 2011). •	 Use	a	variation	of	the	think-pairshare strategy. Most instructional time will be devoted to working in pairs or small groups.",62,mtms2012-12-262A,,
•	 Focus	questions	on	students’	models rather than on the solution. Did the student account for every factor within the problem’s situation? How would the model change if some information in the MEA was deleted or added?  souRces oF Model-eliciting actiVities,63,mtms2012-12-262A,,
"Both NCTM and CCSSM have advocated the positive benefits of teaching mathematics through problem solving.
