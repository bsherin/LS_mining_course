"developing essential Understanding of Mathematical Reasoning,  Pre-K-grade 8 2011. 96 pp., $32.95 paper. ISBN 978-0-87353-666-0. Stock no. 13794. National Council of Teachers of Mathematics; www.nctm.org.",4,mtms2012-09-125a,,
"This book introduces a model for mathematical reasoning as the big idea, which is supported by nine essential understandings. The model  for the big idea is presented as a cyclic process in which each component of the cycle contributes to the development of mathematical reasoning. Each component (conjecturing and generalizing, investigating why, and justifying or refuting) is supported by the essential understandings, and specific examples are used to clarify them.

The process of the mathematical reasoning in Mr. Martinez’s first-grade classroom in this chapter provides a rich example of a reasoning cycle that exemplifies the model. Since this information is from a first-grade classroom, it shows how mathematical reasoning is possible in early grade levels using the model.",7,mtms2012-09-125a,,
"This book is appropriate for in- service teachers who wish to learn about the mathematical reasoning potential in pre-K-grade 8 and implement it in their classrooms. The ideas outlined in the book would be appropriate for professional development teams, in-service teachers, and elementary school and middle school coaches. Moreover, the book can be used with preservice elementary teachers in their method courses as well as in mathematics content courses. For example, I see myself using students’ examples (e.g., justification items found on page 36) from this book to create a discussion about the norms of mathematical reasoning expected in my math content courses. Such examples will also help me engage students with authentic examples from the grade levels that they will teach. ",8,mtms2012-09-125a,,
This book has many strengths. ,9,mtms2012-09-125a,,
"First of all, the model that is introduced (the big idea) highlights mathematical reasoning as a process that has many important components. Second, each important component is described in a very explicit way, with appropriate examples from the grade levels that are under consideration. Both the math content and the grade  levels varied appropriately throughout the book. The focus was not on one particular grade or content area. The third strength is that authors provided nonexamples as well as examples to provide what they mean with the essential understandings. For example, the first vignette in chapter 3 is an important nonexample of the model (the process) of the mathematical reasoning with explicit description of the missing essential understandings. ",10,mtms2012-09-125a,,
"Few weaknesses were found. One involves a statement on page 20: “The fourth figure will have 8 toothpicks because 2n + 1 describes. . . .” It should probably have read “9 toothpicks” instead of “8 toothpicks.” In addition, chapter 2 needs to address essential understanding 5. The “Investigating Why” component of the model is neither highlighted nor mentioned at all in chapter 2. On page 30, the authors state, “Investigating why a general statement may be true or false is an often overlooked part. . . .” Not providing this information in chapter 2 actually supports this idea. Thus, I think the authors should highlight the essential understanding 5 in the examples in chapter 2.",11,mtms2012-09-125a,,
"Other minor suggestions include that the cyclic idea of the mathematical reasoning model can be highlighted again at the beginning of the “Investigating Why” (p. 30) and in the “Justifying and Refuting” (p. 35) sections. The essential understandings on the margin of page 16 are unnecessary; without them, the ideas still read well. On other pages, however, the use of essential understandings in the margins are very helpful.",12,mtms2012-09-125a,,
"I think this publication highlights an important concept. I recommend this book for professional development  teams, method course instructors, and also any pre-K-grade 8 in-service teachers. I personally would consider purchasing this book as a guide for training instructors who teach mathematics content courses.  —Gulden Karakok University of Northern Colorado Greeley, Colorado",13,mtms2012-09-125a,,

"This book contains a collection of problems and activities appropriate for the middle school mathematics  curriculum. It is divided into four chapters: “Number and Operations,” “Measurement and Geometry,” “Data and Chance,”  and “Algebra.” Each chapter contains a variety of problems and activities that focus on problem solving, representation, generalization, and making connections in mathematics.",17,mtms2012-09-125a,,
"Although many of the problems and activities are familiar and can be found in other publications, they are adapted for this book to provide a consistent format, thereby making it easier to read. Many of the activities contain additional information about how they align with the eight Mathematical Practices outlined in the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics. This book is therefore a good resource  for middle school teachers, teacher educators, and preservice teachers who wish to view activities that reflect the Mathematical Practices.",18,mtms2012-09-125a,,
"The teacher notes are particularly useful in helping readers understand the learning goals of the problem or activity. Solutions to the problems are provided, as well as ideas for extending the activities. One problem extension describes calculating the volume of a rectangular box. It asks students to compare the volume of two right circular cylinders created using the same size sheet of paper, rolling one vertically and the other horizontally. This is a familiar problem: Students place the taller cylinder inside the shorter one, fill the taller one with rice or popcorn, and then slowly lift out the taller cylinder so that the rice or popcorn empties into the shorter cylinder. Students then visually compare the volumes. The authors note that this activity connects to ",19,mtms2012-09-125a,,

This book and DVD are designed to support teachers or schools that would like to use lesson study to improve their instruction. Lesson study could be described as lesson research or instructional research. A group of teachers form a professional learning community and design collaborative lessons that focus on student learning. The authors carefully describe and illustrate the four-step process. The focus is on continuous improvement. ,33,mtms2012-09-125a,,
"The book includes background  information, research on teacher and student learning, sample lesson study cycles with accompanying video clips on the DVD, detailed instructions for  starting a lesson study group, and a variety of samples and templates. The authors have extensively studied and applied the Japanese lesson study process and have examined how it can be applied in the United States. Although lesson study is time-consuming to implement, the learning of teachers and students are enhanced by participating in this process. With the arrival of the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics, lesson study can be an effective tool to help teachers and schools effectively adjust and enhance their instructional lessons to incorporate recommended practices. This book and DVD are practical resources that can be used to support teachers as they begin this process.",34,mtms2012-09-125a,,

"Math teachers are aware of what is at stake with students mastering basic facts. Students who are fl uent with  their multiplication and division facts are better able to handle more rigorous math; students who struggle with their facts fi nd that their diffi culties are compounded, as they are slower to access and practice new skills. This book addresses this gap by presenting activities and strategies that facilitate a deeper and speedier acquisition of these basic facts.",40,mtms2012-09-125a,,
"The scope of the book is on multiplication and division facts with factors from 0 through 10. The authors devote  a full chapter to each factor. They suggest an order that helps students link unknown facts to previously learned ones. For example, the chapter “Multiplying by 6” creates a connection to the already learned “times 3” facts and builds on the “times 5” facts.",41,mtms2012-09-125a,,
"Each chapter lays out the big ideas for the factor and provides a series of activities, strategies, and accompanying activity sheets on a CD-ROM. After students have understood the conceptual piece, the authors provide activities to build automaticity. The dual focus on understanding and automaticity creates meaningful, lasting knowledge for students.",42,mtms2012-09-125a,,
This book helps move beyond rote memorization of basic facts in favor of deeper understanding. It will be invaluable to second-grade and third-grade teachers as they plan their instruction. It will also be a boon to teachers in later grades who are remediating students with weak basic fact fl uency.,43,mtms2012-09-125a,,
