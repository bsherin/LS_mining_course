A WorthWhile tAsk to teach Slope,1,mtms2009-10-168a,,
Consider the possibilities when teaching slope. It is a fundamental algebraic concept that has connections to advanced mathematics and to  the world outside the classroom.,2,mtms2009-10-168a,,
"are able to calculate the slope accurately but have difficulty moving beyond simple calculation-based comprehension to a more global understanding of slope as a rate of change (Walter and Gerson 2007). In other words, students are not prepared to apply their knowledge of slope in a meaningful way to the world outside the algebra classroom or see connections between slope and other mathematical concepts.",3,mtms2009-10-168a,,
An Alternative Understanding of Slope,4,mtms2009-10-168a,,
"In elementary school, students begin to understand discrete patterns of change, specifically, where input values can be ordered and counted. The most basic pattern of change is linear. In a discrete linear pattern of change, a given amount is added to each term to get the next term. In other words, the amount of change between consecutive terms remains constant.",5,mtms2009-10-168a,,
The problem below illustrates a  constant rate of change. ,6,mtms2009-10-168a,,
"Joe wants to go to summer camp. However, the camp costs $1000, and he can only attend if he  earns enough money to pay for it. He currently earn $15 per week mowing lawns. If camp starts in 30 weeks, will he be able to earn enough money to go? ",7,mtms2009-10-168a,,
"Table 1 presents the total amount earned during Joe’s first five weeks of work. Writing the amount earned each week until he reaches 30 weeks would be time-consuming. Instead, we can find a formula to describe the amount earned based on the number of weeks worked. Look at the table and observe that the pattern can be  described with the formula y = 15x, in which y is the amount earned and x is the number of weeks worked. In 30 weeks, Joe will have only earned $450, not the necessary $1000.",8,mtms2009-10-168a,,
"Observe that the set of possible input values is the natural numbers, N = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, . . . }, which is a countable and ordered set. Therefore, the pattern is discrete. By working 1 additional week, the total amount earned increases by $15. Thus, this is an example of a discrete linear pattern of change with a constant rate of change of $15.",9,mtms2009-10-168a,,
table 1 Will Joe have time to earn $1000 in 30 weeks at $15 a week? ,10,mtms2009-10-168a,,
Weeks amount $15 $30 $45 $60 $75 . . .,11,mtms2009-10-168a,,

"wWe live in a world in which rapid  change is a way of life. In fact, more changes in technology have occurred during the past fifty years than in all previously recorded history (Dubinsky 2000). Now more than ever, students must become skilled at navigating change to have some control over their future lives. Mathematics helps provide the roadmap necessary for understanding change. However, this understanding must be broad enough so that they can connect the math they learn in the classroom to life outside the classroom. ",13,mtms2009-10-168a,,
"Teachers’ task selections are crucial  for students to develop deeper, more connected mathematical understanding. In this article, I will explore— 1.  two conceptualizations of slope, 2.  determine which concept allows  for the greatest connection to slope as being a rate of change, and  3.  discuss selecting and implementing worthwhile mathematical tasks to help students understand this topic.  slope as “Rise oveR Run”",14,mtms2009-10-168a,,
"Slope is often conceptualized simply as a line’s “rise over run” (i.e., the change in y over the change in x on the Cartesian plane) ( Joram and Oleson 2007; Walter and Gerson 2007). Using this definition, students ",15,mtms2009-10-168a,,
"Since mathematics is found in every aspect of life, it is important  for teachers to  provide experiences that help students find connections and  develop an  appreciation for math and its use in their lives outside school.",16,mtms2009-10-168a,,
"In a prealgebra or first-year algebra course during late middle or early high school, students encounter continuous, rather than discrete, patterns of change. The input terms can still be ordered, but they are not countable. For any two inputs, other input values lie in between. This problem illustrates a continuous pattern of change. ",17,mtms2009-10-168a,,
"Suppose that Sara’s car gets 25  miles per gallon of gasoline. She plans to drive to a friend’s house and wants to determine how much gasoline she will use. Because the distance to the friend’s home is not known, she must determine a formula for the amount of gasoline needed for any given number of miles. ",18,mtms2009-10-168a,,
"In this formula, the number of  miles will be the input, and the amount of gasoline will be the output. The set of possible input values is the set of real numbers, R. We cannot create a list of the first five possible distances, as we did with the previous example, because for any two distances, there are possible distances in between, for which we must also be able to calculate the gas usage. Thus, this is an example of a continuous pattern of change, which can be represented by the formula y = x/25, in which y is the amount of gasoline and x is the number of miles she will drive for any number of miles, including fractional values.",19,mtms2009-10-168a,,
"A fundamental aspect of any  pattern is its rate of change. Similar to discrete linear patterns, continuous linear patterns of change (linear functions) have constant rates of change. However, continuous patterns of change do not have consecutive input terms. Therefore, the constant rate of change for a linear function, called slope, is defined as the uniform proportion of change in the output value to change in the input value. In other words, if we pick any two inputs, x1 and x2, and determine their corresponding outputs, y1 and y2, re- spectively, then the slope will be given by this proportion: ",20,mtms2009-10-168a,,
"From the previous example, inputs of 25 and 75 miles result in outputs of 1 and 3 gallons, respectively. Thus, the slope is",21,mtms2009-10-168a,,
"With this value, we are able to  determine how much the output will be altered by any given change in the input. If Sara originally expects to travel 30 miles to her friend’s house, but the house turns out to actually be 50 miles away, she will need to drive an additional 20 miles. Multiplying the additional miles by the slope, we find that she will need  of gasoline to get to her friend’s house in addition to what she originally anticipated. ",22,mtms2009-10-168a,,
"Although the two conceptualizations of slope are similar, the depth of understanding differs greatly. In the first example using the formula y = x/25, students may be able to use slope to determine the steepness of a line but often cannot see the connections between slope and their prior mathematics background or real-life applications. On the other hand, the second conceptualization of slope, using the value 1/25, is clearly bound to prior mathematical and real-life experiences with patterns and change, which consequently makes it a better choice for developing a deeper understanding of slope.",23,mtms2009-10-168a,,
"MatheMatical task selection “Students develop their sense of what it means to ‘do mathematics’ from their actual experiences with mathematics, and their primary opportunities to experience mathematics as a discipline are seated in the classroom activities in which they engage”  (Henningsen and Stein 1997, p. 525). As a result, selecting “worthwhile” mathematical tasks plays a central role in teaching mathematics (Arbaugh and Brown 2004; Jones and Tarr 2007; Stein and Smith 1998). A “worthwhile” task develops and connects mathematical ideas, concepts, and proficiency; piques students’ interests; and has multiple reasonable solutions to encourage students to hypothesize and reflect on their suppositions (NCTM 1991). This definition, in conjunction with the following categorization of mathematical tasks, will help teachers choose appropriate tasks. ",24,mtms2009-10-168a,,
"Stein and Smith’s (1998) categorization of mathematical tasks (see the sidebar titled “Levels of Cognitive Demand”) begins with the separation of mathematical tasks into levels of cognitive demand: higher and lower. Lower-level demands involve memorization and use of algorithms without context or meaning. Higher-level demands also involve memorized facts or algorithms but in a way that gives mathematics meaning and connects to underlying concepts and between various representations. Stein and Smith divided both the higher- and lower-level mathematical tasks into two groups, again on the basis of the level of cognitive demand. ",25,mtms2009-10-168a,,
"Higher-level mathematical tasks are separated into procedures with connections and doing mathematics; lower-level mathematical tasks are divided into memorization and procedures without connections. Thus, in order from lowest cognitive demand  to highest cognitive demand, the mathematical task groups are— 1.  memorization, 2.  procedures without connections, 3.  procedures with connections, and 4.  doing mathematics.  loW-level tasks",26,mtms2009-10-168a,,
"With memorization, students do not have to truly understand or justify the information; all they need to do is repeat it. Thus, any problem that simply asks students to state a formula is a memorization task. Being asked to recall the mnemonic “rise over run” for calculating slope from two points on a coordinate plane is a memorization task. ",27,mtms2009-10-168a,,
"Two types of procedures have no context. The first, called naked problems, includes the following two examples: 1.  Determine the slope of the line passing through (1, 2) and (4, 6).",28,mtms2009-10-168a,,
"2.  Find the equation of the line with slope 2 and a y-intercept of (0, 4).",29,mtms2009-10-168a,,
"The second type is called pseudoword problems, such as those typically found in traditional textbooks. An example is listed below:",30,mtms2009-10-168a,,
"Mary makes $30,000 per year. Her salary increases by $2,000 per year.  a.  Write an equation for the  amount of money that Mary will make in x years.  b.  Find the amount of money that Mary will be making in 10 years.",31,mtms2009-10-168a,,
"Pseudo-word problems are included in the procedure-without-context category because completing the task is algorithmic (i.e., there is little ambiguity for what needs to be done). The focus is on completing the task and obtaining an answer instead of on the development of deeper mathematical ",32,mtms2009-10-168a,,
"Worthwhile tasks,  which require  students to do the mathematics, do not have clear solution  paths and often  have many possible  correct answers.",33,mtms2009-10-168a,,
"understanding or on making connections, and little or no explanation or justification are required. ",34,mtms2009-10-168a,,
"Teaching math through low-level tasks (i.e., memorization and procedure without context) is important for ensuring that students know and have practiced using important facts and procedures. However, it does not allow students to make connections or determine the relevance of concepts. Therefore, teachers must find ways to further develop students’ understanding; one way is through the use of worthwhile mathematical tasks. ",35,mtms2009-10-168a,,
WoRthWhile tasks,36,mtms2009-10-168a,,
"Worthwhile tasks, which require students to do mathematics, do not have clear solution paths and often have many possible correct answers. To complete such a task, students cannot simply remember memorized facts or complete a rehearsed algorithm; instead, they must use their acquired knowledge to determine how to approach the problem and ensure that every step of the solution process is justifiable. The Hooke’s law problem (fig. 1) is an example of a worthwhile task for teaching the concept of slope as a rate of change. It also gives students the opportunity to solve a new type of problem.  iMpleMenting such a task",37,mtms2009-10-168a,,
Selecting a worthwhile task is just the beginning. Teachers must also maintain the level of cognitive demand throughout the task’s implementation (Doerr 2006; NCTM 2000; Stein and Smith 1998). The Hooke’s law problem is an example of just such a task.,38,mtms2009-10-168a,,
The Hooke’s Law Problem,39,mtms2009-10-168a,,
"A hands-on activity that can be used to introduce the concept of slope to first-year algebra students is shown in figure 1. The problem examines the length of a spring in relation to the weight pulling on it. I begin the lesson on the Hooke’s law problem by having students, in groups of two or three, discuss the problem and create a strat-",40,mtms2009-10-168a,,
Fig. 1 the Hooke’s law problem is a worthwhile task that requires higher levels of mathematical thinking. ,41,mtms2009-10-168a,,
"Use the spring to determine if there is a relationship between the amount of weight attached to the spring and the length of spring stretch. Describe your procedure. if there is a relationship, explain the relationship. Justify your answer. ",42,mtms2009-10-168a,,
"Instructor notes: 1.  the relationship should be approximately linear, and the constant slope is  called the spring constant, or Hooke’s law.",43,mtms2009-10-168a,,
"2.  the following materials, usually found in science classrooms, will be  needed: a spring, a rubber band, a ring stand, two clamps (one for the ring-stand clamp and one for the C-clamp), a spring scale, a ruler or meterstick, and a set of weights (or “known masses”). the following diagram illustrates the assembly of these items.

"Desk or Table egy for determining if a relationship exists. I do not tell the students how to approach a problem because doing so would lessen the cognitive demand by making it more procedural. As each group settles on an approach, students are asked to implement their procedures and make a determination on the basis of their results. To check that all students are participating in the activity, I typically make sure that each group member has a job: One student attaches the weights to the spring; another measures the distance; and the third records the results. ",49,mtms2009-10-168a,,
"As soon as all the groups finish, I ask the class to come to an agreement about the relationship through a whole-class discussion. Once agreement is reached, I present Hooke’s law, which states that the amount by which a material body is deformed (the strain) is linearly related to the force causing the deformation (the stress). A springs obeys Hooke’s law, so we should find that the distance the spring has been stretched away from its equilibrium position (i.e., the position where it would naturally come to rest) is directly proportional to the restoring force (i.e., the amount of weight attached to the spring). In other words,  is the spring’s displacein which ment,  is the amount of weight attached to the spring, and k is the spring’s constant. Note that the arrows above the F and the x in the equation indicate that each is a quantity that has both a direction and a magnitude (i.e., they are vectors). ",50,mtms2009-10-168a,,
"I discuss with the class that many laws in science, such as Hooke’s, are based on empirical observations of physical behavior and are agreed on by the scientific community after repeated experiments.

However, I do not say their relationship is incorrect. Instead, we spend time discussing possible reasons why their results might differ from Hooke’s law and what it would take to discount Hooke’s law. The students usually conclude that their measurements were not very precise. ",57,mtms2009-10-168a,,
"Next, I inquire whether the spring’s  relationship, as described by Hooke’s law, is a continuous or discrete pattern of change. (By this point in my classes, we have already discussed the two types of change patterns, so students are familiar with the terminology.) Some students decide that it is discrete, and others believe that it is continuous. I then invite one of the students who chose discrete to list five consecutive weights in their pattern (such as 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3) and ask why a value halfway between consecutive terms (such as 1.25) is missing from the list. By continuing in this manner, students realize that there is no way to list every possible value. All students come to see that this relationship must be a continuous pattern of change. ",58,mtms2009-10-168a,,
"To introduce the concept of slope, ",59,mtms2009-10-168a,,
"I ask students to find the rate of change for the discrete linear pattern 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, . . .  Most students quickly recognize that this pattern has a constant rate of change of 2 since each term is 2 more than the preceding term. I then ask students what we should do to determine the rate of change for a continuous pattern. ",60,mtms2009-10-168a,,
"Students come to see that continuous patterns of change cannot be written in the same way as discrete ones. Using the spring example, we cannot write the first six terms (or even the first two) because the set of possible inputs (i.e., weights) is impossible to list. Students realize that their understanding of discrete patterns’ rate  of change does not directly apply to continuous functions. At this point, I introduce the concept of slope. ",61,mtms2009-10-168a,,
"The Hooke’s law problem smoothly  integrates science and math, relationships between variables, and discrete and continuous patterns of change. Implementing this task and developing ideas through classroom discussion enable students to connect slope to their previous understanding of rates of change and emphasize the importance and relevance of mathematics.  conclusion",62,mtms2009-10-168a,,
"Since mathematics is found in every aspect of life, it is important for teachers to provide experiences that help students find connections and develop an appreciation for math and its use in their lives outside school. Slope is an excellent example of a math concept that is usually taught without context or connection. Students believe that it must be memorized for the next algebra test and then forgotten. Math educators must find ways to change this misconception. Central to such a change is selecting and implementing worthwhile mathematical tasks. Knowing math is not enough; we must empower our students to actively do math. Only then will we have succeeded in educating them to thrive and excel in an ever-changing world.",63,mtms2009-10-168a,,
