Open-ended projects will motivate your students to think at higher levels.,1,mtms2010-12-272a,,
"dDuring the unit on volume and surface  area, a strange shift occurs with my seventh-grade students. I fi nd students waiting outside the classroom door before school, ready to ambush me with new ideas before fi rst bell. They ask me to explain concepts and formulas outside of class so that they can jump ahead on their math work. At home, they perform Internet searches to fi nd the volume of footballs and ask surprised parents to explain the algebraic notation that they encounter. The pride in their fi nal projects motivates students to take photographs at home with their cell phones and share the results after school with friends. Their enthusiasm and creativity result from authentic assessment in the form of open-ended mathematical projects (OMPs). ",2,mtms2010-12-272a,,
"Teachers know that students arrive in class with a wide range of insights and abilities; they also struggle differently and exhibit different needs. One method of incorporating this diversity is the development of OMPs, which offer the opportunity for differentiation and high levels of engagement that go beyond solving a set of predetermined problems.",3,mtms2010-12-272a,,

"A classroom that encourages students to engage in mathematical thinking has many characteristics. Students should have time and freedom to pursue what interests them. They need to see that the topics they are interested in also relate to mathematics. When teachers carefully select classroom activities, students will be able to reveal their abilities and demonstrate advanced thinking (Greenes and Mode 1999). When the level of mathematics is raised, students will need the freedom to correct their mistakes. Too often, math class can evolve into a fast-moving series of problems to get students to master a concept. We can find mistakes but not always learn from them. Students must be able to reflect on and refine their work (Koshy 2001). ",8,mtms2010-12-272a,,
"With OMPs, students revise their work; with time, their understanding can be richer and deeper. As teachers, we must be ready to provide support so that students move beyond what ",9,mtms2010-12-272a,,
Authentic  learning and complex math are very rarely achieved on the  first try.,10,mtms2010-12-272a,,
is familiar into areas of challenge and creativity (Mann 2006). The dynamics in the classroom should encourage exploration. ,11,mtms2010-12-272a,,
"The use of OMPs allows teachers to weave together learning and assessment at deep levels. Although such projects use class time, they do not take away from instruction required by standards or curricula. Students participate in the creation of mathematics and are able to apply ideas later to meet expectations. They spend approximately two weeks working on   10 Questions to Develop an openEnded mathematical Project",12,mtms2010-12-272a,,
"With all these goals and components in mind, the OMPs begin to evolve. When considering a new project, the following questions help to provide structure:  1.  What topic is essential to the curriculum? 2.  What are some meaningful and real-world applications of this topic? 3.  What applications are appropriate for students of this age and level   of mastery? 4.  How can I include mathematical computation, algebraic notation,   written expression, visual representation, peer collaboration, evaluation  of complexity, and opportunities for reflection and revision? 5.  What choices can I offer in terms of content or product? 6.  What resources do I need for the project? Am I ensuring that all students  have equal opportunities for success in terms of required resources? 7.  What amount of time will students need to produce quality work? 8.  How can I structure a timeline that allows for creativity and rigor? 9.  Are adequate opportunities given for differentiation to accommodate  various student needs? 10. Does this project encourage a deeper understanding of mathematics than  students would otherwise have? a project in and out of class. Because the OMPs are created around core curriculum concepts, the time is well spent.",13,mtms2010-12-272a,,

"I have applied the following project structure repeatedly in seventh-grade math classes. It has been effective with students in large urban districts, in small private schools, and at all ability levels. I have used these projects in settings with a variety of ability groupings as well.",15,mtms2010-12-272a,,

"These OMPs first seek to provide engaging content to increase student motivation and learning. Challenging tasks yield higher cognition, metacognition, and motivation (Diezmann and Watters 2005). In a surprising paradox, my students often seem to be more motivated by more difficult tasks. ",17,mtms2010-12-272a,,
"The projects are worth their effort. When they successfully complete one, they are proud of their accomplishments. The projects are designed to give students the opportunity to move beyond being passive receptors of math curriculum to becoming creative thinkers who view the world around them through the lens of mathematics. Sheffield (1999) suggested that a mathematics continuum exists consisting of “innumerators, doers, computers, consumers, problem solvers, problem posers, creators” (p. 43). As students work through the OMPs, they move from the early levels to the more creative end of the spectrum. ",18,mtms2010-12-272a,,
"Finally, the projects provide an opportunity for student-driven differentiation in the realms of content, process, or product (VanTassel-Baska and Stambaugh 2006). As middle school math classrooms become more and more diverse, OMPs offer one way to tailor instruction to the wide range of students.",19,mtms2010-12-272a,,

"When developing a new project, ",21,mtms2010-12-272a,,
"I keep a few goals in mind. These OMPs are not simply fun activities. They must move students past “unimportant knowledge” to a deeper exploration of the world around them (Renzulli 1982). As they refl ect on and refi ne their work, students receive feedback from their peers and adults to allow for experimentation. Authentic learning and complex math are very rarely achieved on the fi rst try. Just as students are taught to refi ne their writing through the editing of different drafts, they need to learn mathematics by revising their work.",22,mtms2010-12-272a,,
"To create a new project, I spend several weeks determining the most important topics in a given course. I then begin looking for real-life applications. Textbooks contain some ideas that can be expanded to make a meaningful project. In addition, the NCTM Web site and other sites can help during this creation phase. In a few cases, the students themselves have helped me develop a project. Our class discussions may focus on a great application of content, which ",23,mtms2010-12-272a,,

"Although the specifi c mathematical content changes among projects, the format remains the same. Several components are always included. The fi rst four components provide the foundation of the student understanding. The latter three are structural patterns to help students generate the fi nal product (see fi g. 1).",26,mtms2010-12-272a,,

This project challenges students to design a container to hold a fi xed amount of water. To complete the assignment, they must create three sketches with appropriate dimensions and create a prototype of their favorite design. Extensive mathematical computation is the anchor for the project. Students should receive as much, or more, practice on essential skills when completing these projects as they would when working through traditional curricula. ",28,mtms2010-12-272a,,
"Although appropriate projects for students at other ages may not require a lot of computation, the particular courses I teach need to have this component. The Water Bottle Project requires students to complete dozens of volume and surface-area calculations. They use creative problem solving as they determine the appropriate dimensions of their shape and then verify the accuracy with elaborate computations. Similarly, algebraic notation is important in developing abstract thinking and reasoning. Students are motivated to understand  complex formulas so that they can find a good shape and size for their design. For example, the surface area equation",29,mtms2010-12-272a,,
SA = 2pr 2 + 2prh becomes meaningful to students as they calculate the amount of cardboard needed to build a cylindrical  model. This equation is no longer a line of math from their textbook to be memorized for a test and promptly forgotten. ,30,mtms2010-12-272a,,

"Total grade: allows students to integrate multiple ways of viewing mathematics. The student who doodles during class is now a popular resource who is asked to sketch ideas. The student known for his writing skills now helps other students craft their arguments. The artistic strengths, creativity with words, and strong interpersonal abilities that some students have can be tapped to lead to a deeper understanding and explanation of the math.",50,mtms2010-12-272a,,
"As the teacher, the structure that I provide allows students to approach the project in manageable pieces. Students begin each project with a proposal. They are given time to brainstorm and ask some “What if?” questions during the beginning phases of a project. The day I introduce the Water Bottle Project is typically filled with lots of raised hands.  •	 “How	would	I	do	the	flat	pattern	 for a Superman symbol?”  •	 “Do	you	know	how	to	find	the	 volume of a doughnut?”  •	 “Has	anyone	ever	made	a	car?”	 •	 “Can	I	ask	my	dad	to	help	me	 build it?” ",51,mtms2010-12-272a,,
"My favorite response is from students who will start sketching shapes that they cannot yet name or measure but can imagine. As time progresses, students learn that they need to refine their ideas. Some ideas that were originally fascinating will remain on the proverbial drawing board. Two  examples are the water bottle in a shoe and the flat pattern for a sphere. ",52,mtms2010-12-272a,,
"Many of the OMPs contain rough- draft deadlines (see fig. 2). Students must bring in their work in progress to get reactions and suggestions from peers and the teacher.

"A few weeks after the end of  the Water Bottle Project one year, I received a telephone call from the mother of one of my students.

Her	son	picked	the	P	as	a	link	 to Purdue University, his grandfather’s alma mater. Spencer spent days on his schematic drawings and had the volume within 3 cm3 of the requirements.	He	had	his	heart	set	on	making	 the	water	bottle	out	of	metal.	His	 other grandfather had a basement full of “cool tools,” and they spent several hours one Saturday making the final prototype out of sheet metal.

The increase in the diversity of our students and the complexity of their needs can be a rich addition to a mathematics classroom. The challenge for teachers is to find a way to include students’ interests and creativity in a way that allows for rigorous mathematics. The idea of open-ended  mathematical projects has allowed me to look beyond textbooks when planning instruction. This structure gives students opportunities to excel and flourish. The elements of collaboration and reflection enrich the culture in my classroom. These long-term projects invite creativity into math class. The results are well worth the additional effort required to move beyond what is familiar.,58,mtms2010-12-272a,,
