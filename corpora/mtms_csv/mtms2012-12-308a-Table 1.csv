"Estimation is an essential mathematical competency that is closely linked to the development of number and number sense in K–12 mathematics education (CCSSI 2010; NCTM 2000). Very young students are encouraged to estimate quantities in terms of more, less, heavier, lighter,  longer, and shorter (NCTM 2006). After the first grade, students at every grade use estimation skills to approximate measurement and computation. By high school, students should be skilled at recognizing and employing a wide range of computational estimation strategies.",3,mtms2012-12-308a,,
"However, despite its prominence throughout school curricula, estimation has proven to be difficult for students to learn (McIntosh, Reys, and Reys 1997). One reason would be a disconnection between the development of students’ estimation abilities in measurement and computation. ",4,mtms2012-12-308a,,

"Although connecting computational estimation to measurement estimation is efficient, the former is typically emphasized and taught separately from the latter. In this article, we present guided discovery activities, providing students with opportunities to explore and measure geometric figures to connect measurement estimation with computational estimation. The activities are intended to be used sequentially, activity 1 through activity 4. The goals are to help students accomplish the following: •	 Investigate	triangles	and	circles	by	 measuring lengths with rulers •	 Use	relationships	between	parts	 and computational estimation to find approximate lengths of missing parts of triangles and circles  lengths, ranging from about 1/2 inch to 6 inches, and stored in a paper bag; a 12-inch ruler; a pencil; a red pen or pencil; and activity sheet 1.

"Each pair of students selects two  straws and measures their lengths with the ruler. They record the lengths as side a and side b of a triangle. The students construct a triangle using the straws to form the first angle of the triangle and positioning the ruler as the third side, side c (see fig. 1). By aligning the beginning of the ruler with the end of one straw and adjusting the angle formed by the straws, students estimate many possible lengths for the third side along the ruler. Figure 1 displays two possible triangles that can be formed with straws that are 2 1/2 and 5 inches long.  •	 Discover	the	interconnectedness	of	",7,mtms2012-12-308a,,

"Students, working in pairs, investigate and estimate the length of the third side of a triangle when the lengths of two sides are known. Each pair of students needs the following supplies: a dozen straws, cut to different  two possible triangles, one constructed with a short side c and the other with a long side c. They draw the side c with a red pen (for emphasis) and label each side with its respective measurement. Students repeat these steps, selecting new straws, constructing triangles, and recording their work. Students will begin to see  patterns, and teachers can prompt students to reason by asking questions that may help them recognize that the length of side c is greater than the difference between the first two sides. Such questions include these:  •	 Can	an	estimate	for	the	shortest	 possible side c be computed since we know the lengths of side a  and side b? •	 Do	you	see	a	pattern	relating	the	 lengths of side a and side b to a maximum length of side c? •	 What	is	the	difference	between	 side a and side b? How does that compare to side c? ",9,mtms2012-12-308a,,
"Likewise, asking “How does the sum of side a and side b compare with the length of side c?” helps students understand that side c is less than the sum of side a and side b. ",10,mtms2012-12-308a,,
"To complete activity sheet 1,   students make generalizations about the length of the side c in terms of sides a and b (see fig. 2). Side c is greater than |a - b| and less than  a + b, which can be written as a compound inequality:  |a - b| < c < a + b",11,mtms2012-12-308a,,
"If students have not learned absolute value, then consistently using a to represent the longer of the two sides of fixed length will eliminate the need for including absolute value.",12,mtms2012-12-308a,,

"Students use computational estimation with addition and subtraction to estimate the shortest and longest possible lengths for an unknown side of a triangle when the lengths of two sides are known. Each pair of students will use the paper bag containing the dozen precut straws, the 12-inch ruler, a pencil, and activity sheet 2. Activity 2 builds on activity 1.",14,mtms2012-12-308a,,

Next, they estimate the range of lengths that are possible for side c by estimating the difference between the lengths of side a and  side b and estimating the sum of these two lengths.

"Students investigate the relationship between the diameters and the circumferences of circles. Each pair of students needs a couple of circular  objects that vary in size (e.g., a lid, a plate, a can, or a Frisbee®), different colors of ribbon, scissors, a measuring tape, and activity sheet 3.

"Each pair of students selects one  circular object and one color of ribbon and records their choices on the activity sheet. Each pair, working together, cuts two lengths of ribbon so that one length is equivalent to the diameter and the other length is equivalent to the circumference. Students examine the two lengths of ribbon and describe how the length of the circumference ribbon compares with the diameter ribbon. Students may describe the  ",22,mtms2012-12-308a,,

"circumference ribbon simply as “longer” than the diameter ribbon. They may need to be prompted for more specific comparisons with such questions as “How much longer? Is it twice as long, three times longer, or four times longer?” This exercise is  repeated with different-size circular objects, using a different color of ribbon for each circle. The desired outcome of this investigation is for students to generalize their findings: •	 The	circumference	of	any	circle	is	 approximately equal to three times its diameter, or C ≈ 3d.  •	 The	diameter	of	any	circle	is	  approximately equal to 1/3  its diameter, or d ≈ C ÷ 3 or  d ≈ (1/3)C.",24,mtms2012-12-308a,,
Note that students may need to be informed that the ≈ symbol means  approximately equal. The equations  C ≈ 3d and d ≈ C ÷ 3 provide an example of inverse operations. The concept of dividing by a number being the same as multiplying by its reciprocal is demonstrated in d ≈ C ÷ 3 and  d ≈ (1/3)C.,25,mtms2012-12-308a,,
"In the next part of the activity,   students investigate further the  estimation of diameter. They use a measuring tape to find the actual length of the circumference of a circular object, then they use the gener- alization, d ≈ C ÷ 3 or d ≈ (1/3)C, to compute an estimate for the circle’s diameter. Next, students measure the actual diameter of the object and compare the measured diameter with the estimate. These steps are repeated with circles of different sizes, thus revealing a pattern: The actual diameters are a little shorter than their estimates. ",26,mtms2012-12-308a,,
"The last part of this activity is a further investigation into circumference estimation. After using a measuring tape to find the actual length of the diameter of a circular object, students use their generalization,  C ≈ 3d, to estimate the circle’s circumference. They then measure the actual circumference of the object and compare it with the estimate. After they discover that the measured  circumferences are all a little longer than their estimates, students are  provided the following information  to complete their activity sheets:  •	 The	circumference	is	actually	 3.1415926 . . . times longer than the diameter.  •	 This	constant	value	is	called	pi, its symbol is p, and it is typically rounded to 3.14, or 22/7. ",27,mtms2012-12-308a,,
"A discussion about number sense and operations can be introduced by posing	the	questions,	“Why	were	the	 estimates for diameters a little more than	their	actual	lengths?	Why	were	 the estimates for circumferences a little less than their actual lengths?” The discussion should revolve around the fact that when estimating, the value 3 was used, which is less than the actual value of pi. Thus, dividing by 3 instead of 3.14 resulted in estimated diameters that were greater than their actual lengths; multiplying by 3 instead of 3.14 resulted in estimated circumferences that were less than their actual lengths.",28,mtms2012-12-308a,,

"In this fourth activity, students will use computational estimation for multiplication and division to estimate the lengths of circles’ circumferences or diameters. For review, students are asked to recall that the symbol for pi is p and its value is typically rounded to 3.14, or 22/7 (see activity sheet 4). ",30,mtms2012-12-308a,,
"Teachers provide values for the lengths of diameters for circles, and students use estimation strategies to compute approximate circumferences. In the last part, circumferences are supplied by teachers and students estimate diameters. Figure 4 presents possible student responses to these tasks.",31,mtms2012-12-308a,,
"Exploring the relationships  between parts of a circle provides an opportunity to discuss the properties of equality and the interconnectedness of the formulas for circumference, diameter, and pi. Some students will understand this concept based on their knowledge of solving one-step equations. In other words, solving  C = pd for the value of p is similar to solving 12 = 4x for the value of x. To solve 12 = 4x, both sides are divided by 4; thus, x = 3. Similarly, if both sides of C = pd are divided by d, then p = C/d; pi is equal to the ratio of the circumference to the diameter. Likewise, if both sides of C = pd are divided by p, then d = C/p; the  diameter is equal to the circumference divided by pi.",32,mtms2012-12-308a,,

This article presents a series of activities that combine geometry, relative lengths, measurement estimation, and computational estimation. The interconnectedness of the mathematical concepts is intended to expand students’ conceptual understanding of estimation. ",34,mtms2012-12-308a,,
"Through pair work, students are  encouraged to communicate their mathematical decision making and discuss their reasoning. Students have the opportunity to develop a deep understanding of the mathematics related to these activities as they experience the concrete-representational-abstract (CRA) instructional strategy (Flores 2010), beginning with concrete models (straws and ribbon), progressing to representational models (drawings of geometric fi gures), and fi nally using abstract symbols (variables, numbers, and operations).",35,mtms2012-12-308a,,
