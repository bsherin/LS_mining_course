"Research has shown that students internalize mathematics through challenging and open-ended problems. Unfortunately,  some teaching tends to reduce math to memorization and multiple-choice questions. The authors feel that although teachers face challenges with district and state mandates, the true roles of a mathematics educator have been overshadowed. These roles are to promote mathematical thinking through problem solving and to close ",6,mtms2011-10-188a,,

"The authors offer a wide variety of strategies and step-by-step procedures for remedying this problem while honoring and acknowledging the many other requirements that teachers currently face. Creating classrooms with visible thinking, or involving students in the learning process so that they are better able to articulate their learning and thinking, is the recurring theme. ",8,mtms2011-10-188a,,
The book’s obvious strength is that  the authors are keenly aware of their audience of mathematics educators and write accordingly. They acknowledge the disconnect between research and real-world practice and provide viable options for finding a comfortable balance between the two. ,9,mtms2011-10-188a,,
"I found the example problems and lesson plans to be the most useful portions of the book. As a middle school math teacher, I am always looking for new and practical strategies to engage and challenge my students. The ideas in this book are easy to implement and definitely worth a try. Although the book provides insight for administrators, it would be most useful to mathematics educators at the upper elementary and middle school levels.",10,mtms2011-10-188a,,

"This activity book is designed to give students familiarity and practice with coordinate graphing while they create art in the form of traditional quilt blocks. It includes directions for thirty-six different quilt block designs, which, when finished, could be used for a bulletin board display. The difficulty of the designs varies, so they can be selected to match student skill level. In addition, each set of directions includes appropriate geometric vocabulary that can be used to name the shapes on the design. Students may select the colors, or the teacher might select holiday colors or school colors to build school spirit. ",13,mtms2011-10-188a,,
"The activities reinforce an understanding of integers and coordinate graphing conventions. Two different coordinate grid templates are available, one with numbered axes and one without. All the designs can be made with these templates.",14,mtms2011-10-188a,,
I like the numerous design choices  and that all students can be challenged. The author also provides links to resources that would allow teachers to connect these activities to the history of quilts as part of an integrated unit. Extensions suggest how students can create their own quilt designs and then write graphing directions. ,15,mtms2011-10-188a,,
"This book could be a resource for teachers looking to fill short days or weeks or for emergency substitute planning. Note that it has limited usefulness for teaching concepts, since it offers only cursory background content about integers and coordinate  graphing. However, it is an engaging and effective review and reinforcement activity.",16,mtms2011-10-188a,,

"Making Math Accessible is designed for the teacher of mathematics, whether a mathematics educator, special educator, TESOL  educator, or other specialist. The introduction and first six chapters are designed to provide background information on at-risk students: who they are, why they struggle, and what educators can do to modify teaching to provide support and opportunities to succeed. The author develops the activities presented in chapter 7 to reinforce the points that she is making in the earlier chapters. This chapter provides templates and teacher pages that more thoroughly describe the activities. The author describes these activities, which she recommends, as “best practices tweaked.” This is an accurate description. ",20,mtms2011-10-188a,,
"From game boards to interactive  bulletin boards, Ptacek takes algebraic and geometric content and shows educators how to more actively engage learners in fun-filled mathematical practice. The content and materials provided are appropriate for her target population and students in 7–12 classrooms. The background information in the first chapters, especially 1 and 2, is somewhat superfluous, because it is something that all educators know  and understand. However, since it sets the stage for the activities she recommends, it is not unacceptable. ",21,mtms2011-10-188a,,
"The CD is a PDF/Word version of the documents in chapter 7. The inclusion of both formats will be helpful to educators, because many of the activities can easily be modified for other content. The text is useful, and overall I recommend the book. It is a user-friendly easy read that can also be adapted to meet the needs of all students.",22,mtms2011-10-188a,,

"This book is intended to address mathematics using the context of arts and crafts. The intended audience is middle school students. Pottery,  woodworking, cooking, and art provide the primary examples for the content.",27,mtms2011-10-188a,,
"The book tries to set mathematical examples into real-world contexts in an attempt to provide connections for students and broaden the appeal of mathematics. Unfortunately, the treatment of the mathematics is done at a very procedural level, so many opportunities to connect the context to the mathematical concepts are lost. For example, on page 16 the shrinkage rate of clay is given as the raw clay length divided by the fired clay length: 10 inches ÷ 8.75 inches = 1.14. The shrinkage rate is said to be 0.14, or 14%. On the following page, the conversion between decimals and percents is given in this way: “Basically, just move the decimal over 2 places.” This statement ignores the main area where students stumble with this type  of problem: understanding where the 1 went when converting 1.14 into 0.14. On page 75, a doll house is said to be 1/12th scale of a house that is 24 feet tall; the answer given is 24 feet ÷ 12 = 2 feet. The underlying concept that multiplying by 1/12 is dividing by 12 is left unmentioned, which loses the connection to the concept of fraction multiplication. ",28,mtms2011-10-188a,,

"Saraswati’s Way takes its reader to rural India, where young Akash is about to embark on a journey that will bring him from loss to belonging,  from despair to hope, and from childhood into young adulthood. With honesty and without sentimentality, this book addresses the pressing challenges of child labor, poverty, drug abuse, and homelessness. Through this adversity, Akash clings to the dream in his heart—to continue his education. From ancient Vedic texts, he has learned how to multiply large numbers in his head. Some nights he falls asleep thinking about “triangle” numbers and other sequences. Throughout his journey, Akash dreams and schemes to find a way to get a tutor in math so that he might win a scholarship to high school.",32,mtms2011-10-188a,,
"This is not a book about math,  and students will not learn math by reading it. However, strong themes of mathematics run throughout the  book. It will be deeply engaging to middle schoolers because Akash’s love for numbers is compelling and perhaps even contagious. Although students may not learn a great deal of math content through this book, they will have much to think about with respect to the place that mathematics has in our lives. The book could be used as an introduction to mental math strategies or number sequences. It would also be an excellent choice for an integrated curriculum. ",33,mtms2011-10-188a,,

"This book provides a comprehensive discussion of middle school mathematics teacher development around the world. It begins with snapshots of K–12 schooling, teachers’ roles, and teacher preparation in the six participating countries. The remainder of the book looks at data-driven comparisons in the context of preservice teachers’ opportunities to learn (OTL) in teacher preparation both within and across countries. The OTL are organized into the areas of mathematics, mathematics pedagogy, general pedagogy, and school-based practice. A strong point of this book is its  ability to empirically explore the complex milieu of middle school mathematics and teacher education. The theoretical framework and data analysis are validated through extensive discussions of study limitations. The hypothetical pedagogical applications based on the results are explored from multiple perspectives. This approach shows a realistic and rigorous way to conduct sound research, contextualized in multilayered educational environments. ",37,mtms2011-10-188a,,
"The authors also provide a rich context for comparing and understanding middle school mathematics education and teacher preparation in the participating countries. From the described strengths of this book, there are two clear uses. First, the book offers a methodological guide for present and future studies of mathematics teacher preparation. Second, the context of the book makes an excellent resource for rich, educational discussions. Thus, it is highly recommended for mathematics teacher educators, novice teachers, practicing teachers, administrators, and policymakers working in mathematics education.",38,mtms2011-10-188a,,

"This monograph tells the story of a mathematics teacher who was successful in teaching African American students in a high-poverty school in Gaines- ville, Florida. Success was defined through colleagues, parents, children, and educators who described Gloria Jean Merriex’s mathematics teaching  methods as culturally responsive, masterful, and highly demanding; and through consistent highest pass rates on the state’s math assessments. This monograph is organized into three parts. In part 1, readers learn that Merriex was nurtured in the community in which she taught; consequently, she understood the resources available and the challenges found in her community. Glimpses into her life provide readers with a lens of her communal roots, beliefs, and persistence for excellence. ",43,mtms2011-10-188a,,
"In part 2, Merriex’s pedagogical  methods are described within a working theory of Culturally Responsive Mathematics Teaching (CRMT). CRMT consists of four cornerstones: knowledge of math and pedagogy, relationship and trust, communication, and constant revision and reflection. Part 3 uses the voices of students,  parents, and colleagues to describe Merriex’s impact on teaching, the community, and the profession. Implications for the classroom, mathematics teacher education programs, and future research are also provided in part 3. This monograph is a wonderful  tribute to this teacher, who passed away suddenly in May 2008. The author authentically integrates Merriex’s voice and actions to allow readers to see her classroom. Educators should read this monograph to learn of her effective use of pedagogy. Teacher educators and researchers will find this monograph appropriate for mathematics and qualitative research methods courses.  —Robert Q.

"The lessons and accompanying handouts are designed to develop spatial reasoning, explore transitioning between dimensions, and present problems that require an understanding of spatial reasoning. Students move through tasks that are multidimensional. Topics include drawing cube structures; projecting solids into two dimensions; and analyzing polycubes, slices, solids of revolutions, and Sierpinski triangles and pyramids. The author does not always use precise mathematical language. For example, a horizontal fold is described as “hamburger style” (p. 18). Using an overhead screen as a model of a line (p. 15), students are asked to imagine it as a set of fat points (p. 15). I was also surprised to fi nd typographical mistakes in the text (p. 21); the word “diffi culty” is printed as “di# culty.” ",48,mtms2011-10-188a,,
