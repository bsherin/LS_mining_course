0,Exponent Rummy - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"As classroom teachers, we try to provide opportunities for students to practice and use the algebra skills they are learning in ways that are nonroutine. We also want to help students connect the big ideas of math with the skills they are learning as part of the balance between understanding concepts and procedures. Math games can be used to accomplish these goals.",,
1,Exponent Rummy - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Exponent Rummy was designed for students to use the properties of integer exponents to simplify expressions with a variable base. Such practice can help them increase procedural fluency as they practice manipulating the symbols. It is appropriate for students to practice when they are learning these properties and also later as review. The specific exponents shown in the cards were chosen on purpose so that students could both work mentally and increase their facility with exponents.,,
2,Exponent Rummy - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"A deck of Exponent Rummy cards includes eleven sets of five cards. One card in each set is an exponential expression in simplest form, indicated by the box around the expression. The other four cards in the set have expressions that can be simplified to match the simplest form card by using the properties of exponents. One complete set is shown in figure 1; a complete set of cards appears at the end of this article as activity sheet 2.",,
3,Exponent Rummy - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
4,Exponent Rummy - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Each group of three to five students will need a deck of Exponent Rummy cards. Printing each deck of cards on card stock of a different color makes organizing easier if the decks get mixed up or if a card gets separated from its deck.,,
5,Exponent Rummy - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The cards can be used for three different activities. Exponent Rummy was originally designed as a game, but students needed additional practice sorting the cards into sets, so sorting is done before the game. One group of students created a second game after completing the other two activities.",,
6,Exponent Rummy - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,SORTING CARDS,,
7,Exponent Rummy - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"For the sorting activity, the simplest-form cards are placed on the table. Students match the remaining expression cards to the appropriate simplest-form card. The students in most groups worked individually on the cards they identified quickly and then worked together to figure out where the more challenging expressions belonged. In other groups, rather than giving each student some of the cards to sort, the students looked at each card together and decided where to place it.",,
8,Exponent Rummy - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"After a group has placed all its cards into sets, students may be dismayed to learn that each set should have the same number of cards. If the sets are unequal, it is time to re-examine and reorganize the cards in each set. Students discuss why a card belongs to one set and not another.",,
9,Exponent Rummy - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The teacher can circulate among the groups to assess how well the exponent properties are understood by listening to students justifying why a card belongs in a particular set. I find that listening to students can also alert me to the necessity of raising other issues involving language use and concepts. I frequently hear x2 described as x two, so I know I will need to address this nonstandard mathematical language, which may stem from an incomplete understanding of an exponent. If a group seems stuck and does not yet have the cards sorted correctly, I can remove a card that is placed incorrectly, thereby asking the group to focus on one card only to find its simplest form.",,
10,Exponent Rummy - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,PLAYING THE GAME,,
11,Exponent Rummy - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"When students have completed the sorting activity, they can begin playing Exponent Rummy. Games can serve many purposes in math class. They can",,
12,Exponent Rummy - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,engage student interest with little fear of failure;,,
13,Exponent Rummy - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,allow for group interaction and communication among students;,,
14,Exponent Rummy - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,provide skill practice without paper-and-pencil drill;,,
15,Exponent Rummy - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,be used for concept development; and,,
16,Exponent Rummy - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,provide a nice change of pace to the classroom routine.,,
17,Exponent Rummy - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Games can also be used as formative assessment because the teacher can watch and listen to the students work and thereby determine how accurate and confident they are with the topic and the mathematical language involved.,,
18,Exponent Rummy - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The first game of Exponent Rummy requires somewhat different thinking strategies than the sorting activity because not all the simplest-form cards are on the table at one time. While playing the game, a student is constantly scanning the cards on the table and in hand for matches. This means that a card in hand may be simplified mentally several times by the student before it is actually played on the table.",,
19,Exponent Rummy - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In one instance, a group playing the first game realized that an incorrect card had been played. They decided to remove that card from the table and mix it in with the remaining cards in the draw pile. Their decision highlights a nice aspect of this game in that the rules are flexible and can be adjusted by the students or by the teacher as needed.",,
20,Exponent Rummy - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Some students have not grown up playing board games and card games, so game etiquette should be explained. For example, cards need to be shuffled; they are dealt, one at a time, to members of the group, starting to the dealers left; players take turns dealing; and play proceeds to the left.",,
21,Exponent Rummy - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,The second Exponent Rummy game is played like Go Fish. (See activity sheet 1.),,
22,Exponent Rummy - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Games such as Exponent Rummy are effective when there are several pieces of information that go together or when there are different ways of viewing the same idea. Teachers at my school and other schools have used this game. It is a go-to activity that we make time for when practice with properties of integer exponents is the objective.,,
