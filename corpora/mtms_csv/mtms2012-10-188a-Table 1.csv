"administrator’s guide: interpreting the common core state standards to improve Mathematics education 2011. 113 pp., $23.95 paper. ISBN 978-0-85753-695-0. Stock no. 14288. National Council of Teachers of Mathematics; www.nctm.org.",4,mtms2012-10-188a,,
This book gives school leaders the background information and tools to help build  high-quality mathematics programs that support the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSM). The author describes the data from research on college and career readiness as well as national and international tests of achievement in mathematics. The analysis underscores the need for a set of common career-readiness and college-readiness standards to ensure that all high school graduates are prepared for work or college.,5,mtms2012-10-188a,,
"One of the strengths of this book   is the clear explanation of how the  CCSSM are organized. From pre-K– grade 8, the standards are organized around critical areas of mathematics; in grades 9-12, they are organized into six conceptual categories. In each category, clusters of specific standards are ",6,mtms2012-10-188a,,

The comparisons made among the CCSSM, NCTM’s Principles and Standards for School Mathematics, and Focus in High School Mathematics are very useful. These comparisons help school leaders see how current school curriculum influenced by the NCTM Standards and Focal Points relate to the CCSSM. ",7,mtms2012-10-188a,,
"Actual examples of classroom   vignettes are provided to help the reader develop an understanding of what high-quality mathematics classrooms look like at the elementary, middle, and high school levels. The book also suggests actions that school leaders can take to support the development of mathematics programs that align with the CCSSM. Additional resources are provided to help both administrators and teachers continue to develop mathematics programs in their schools that support the CCSSM.",8,mtms2012-10-188a,,

"Denton, Texas  developing essential Understanding of algebraic thinking, grades 3-5 2011. 102 pp., $30.95 paper. ISBN 978-0-87353-668-4. Stock no. 13796. National Council of Teachers of Mathematics; www.nctm.org.",11,mtms2012-10-188a,,
"What does it mean to do algebra in the elementary school? How does early algebra prepare students for what they will encounter later with the subject? Have you wondered about these or similar questions? This recent volume in the Essential Understanding series provides valuable insights about what it means to engage in algebraic thinking in the elementary years. Although clearly geared toward grades 3-5, teachers of all levels up to and  including a formal course in algebra (or an equivalent) will find its concise articulation of “big ideas” useful. Mathematics educators will also appreciate this book because of the algebraic road map that it contains for the understandings that teachers should possess.",12,mtms2012-10-188a,,
"This book is composed of three easy-to-read and engaging chapters. The first chapter defines and describes five big ideas of early algebra: arithmetic as a context for algebraic thinking, equations, variables, quantitative reasoning, and functional thinking. The second chapter highlights the connections between the big ideas and across preceding and succeeding grade levels. The final chapter translates the big ideas of early algebra to classroom practices, identifying how discourse, task and assessment selection, and mathematical processes could play out effectively in an elementary classroom.",13,mtms2012-10-188a,,
"This book is an excellent product of  quality research and provides conceptual support for educators’ understanding of the Common Core domains of Operations and Algebraic Thinking as well as Expressions and Equations. If you wonder what it means to do early algebra or how your future students might be prepared for your classroom, this book is the resource for you.",14,mtms2012-10-188a,,

"Painless Algebra contains much of the same content as a traditional algebra textbook. The early chapters explain  basic algebraic content, such as integer operations, linear equations and inequalities, and graphing linear functions. The latter chapters include more abstract and advanced algebraic concepts, such as solving systems of equations, simplifying exponent and radical expressions, and solving quadratic equations. ",21,mtms2012-10-188a,,
"The book is organized in a clear, linear fashion. It provides examples, practice problems, and solutions to practice problems. It is concise yet still contains essential vocabulary with which students will need to be familiar. The primary purpose of the book is to develop students’ basic knowledge and skills of foundational algebraic concepts. However, the end of each chapter offers several word problems that  foster deeper conceptual understanding by helping students make mathematical connections and apply algebraic concepts to real-world settings.",22,mtms2012-10-188a,,
"Painless Algebra would be a nice resource for any student who needs extra practice with basic algebraic concepts and would appeal to a wide variety of students. It would be appropriate for advanced students in grades 4 and 5 seeking enrichment or acceleration, for students in grade 8 who need extra support, and as a tutoring resource for any student in grades 4 through 9. Parents seeking to give their child a head start and preview of algebra might also fi nd this book useful. It would also be a great supplemental textbook for teacher educators whose preservice teachers need to sharpen and refresh their algebraic knowledge.  —Kenneth Whaley",23,mtms2012-10-188a,,
