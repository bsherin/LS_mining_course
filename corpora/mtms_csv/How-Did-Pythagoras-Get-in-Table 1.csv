4,How Did Pythagoras Get into Calvins Homework_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"b. In the second panel, Hobbes says, “So we’ll draw a square and make this side 6 and that side 3.” What geometric error did he make in that sentence?",,

6,How Did Pythagoras Get into Calvins Homework_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"4. In the fourth panel, Calvin said, “But this diagonal is just a little under two.”",,
7,How Did Pythagoras Get into Calvins Homework_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,a. Explain how Calvin may have determined this number from the diagram drawn in the  second frame.,,

9,How Did Pythagoras Get into Calvins Homework_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"5. Calvin and Hobbes are at  the back-left corner of a  160 ft. × 360 ft. football field (including end zones). Looking out across the field, Calvin says, “Let’s race to the back-right  corner of the other end zone.”      Calvin’s speed is 14 ft./sec.    Hobbes’s speed is 16 ft./sec.   Hobbes agrees and says, “OK. I’ll run along the sidelines, and you run diagonally across the field from this corner to the other. That should make it a closer race.” Who wins the race and by how much?",,
10,How Did Pythagoras Get into Calvins Homework_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"6.  A triathlon is a race with three events: swimming, bicycling, and running. The person with the fastest combined time for all three events is the winner. Calvin and Hobbes are competing in a triathlon with a 2-kilometer swim and an 8-kilometer run. The course is the shape of a right triangle.",,

13,How Did Pythagoras Get into Calvins Homework_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"b. Calvin is 30 seconds behind Hobbes when he gets out of the water. He gets on his bicycle and rides at a rate of  40 km/hr. Meanwhile, Hobbes rides his bike at a rate of  36 km/hr. Who is ahead at the end of the bicycle portion of the race? By how much? Round to the nearest hundredth of a kilometer.",,

17,How Did Pythagoras Get into Calvins Homework_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"b. Hobbes drew a 6 × 3 rectangle, not a square. Since the dimensions of the sides are different, the figure is not a square.",,
18,How Did Pythagoras Get into Calvins Homework_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,3.  Yes; 9 is a square number because it can be written as the square of some other integer: 32 = 9.,,
19,How Did Pythagoras Get into Calvins Homework_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,4.  a.Sample answer: It looks like Calvin may have used a ruler to measure the diagonal on Hobbes’s drawing.,,

27,How Did Pythagoras Get into Calvins Homework_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,or about 6.71.,,
28,How Did Pythagoras Get into Calvins Homework_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"5.  Calvin wins by about 4.4 seconds. Sample solution: Hobbes runs  160 + 360, or 520, feet. Use the formula, d = rt, where d = 520 ft. and r = 16/sec.: 520 = 16t. Solving for t, it will take Hobbes 520 ÷ 16, or 32.5, sec. To find the distance that Calvin runs, use the  Pythagorean theorem: a2 + b2 = c2, where c is the distance he runs.",,

34,How Did Pythagoras Get into Calvins Homework_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"At a speed of 14 ft./sec., it will take him 394 ÷ 14, or about 28.1, sec. Thus, Calvin wins the race by  32.5 – 28.1, or about 4.4, seconds.",,
35,How Did Pythagoras Get into Calvins Homework_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"6. a. The bicycle portion is about  8.25 km long. Use c 2 = 22 + 82, where c is the distance of the bike portion. This simplifies to  c2 = 4 + 64, or c2 = 68. Taking the positive square root of both sides,",,

47,How Did Pythagoras Get into Calvins Homework_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,FIELD-TEST COMMENTS,,
48,How Did Pythagoras Get into Calvins Homework_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Students struggled most with question 4. I pointed out that Calvin was holding a ruler in the last frame, but few caught on to the difference between measuring and calculating the answer. I had students draw a two-inch line, then draw a square around it such that the line formed the hypotenuse. Then I had them label the square like Hobbes did. That push helped them make the connection that the drawing was not to scale and was not proportional, and that the measurements did not correspond to the calculated dimensions.",,
49,How Did Pythagoras Get into Calvins Homework_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Several of my students were learning English as a second language, and they struggled with the “right/left back corner” phrase. They benefited from sketching out the problem and labeling the corners and sidelines, and identifying the line “across the field.”",,

54,How Did Pythagoras Get into Calvins Homework_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In talking with a colleague about this problem, we actually agreed that students sometimes overcomplicate solutions to problems that they do not understand. This is particularly true with students who have reading difficulties and/or are careless in dissecting a given problem.",,
55,How Did Pythagoras Get into Calvins Homework_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"My students, on the other hand, believe that some word problems are “convoluted” and ask simple questions in a roundabout way that may be confusing to them. My geometry students thought that Hobbes  had totally lost it! What does the  Pythagorean theorem have to do with 6 + 3? They actually got confused on the question of whether Y is a square number (“Of course,” they said, “since it is c 2.”); they had immediately found the length of the hypotenuse without reading the entire problem, thus prompting a lively discussion on whether",,
56,How Did Pythagoras Get into Calvins Homework_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
57,How Did Pythagoras Get into Calvins Homework_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"My students also found it funny when Calvin used a ruler and Hobbes decided to draw a larger scale. They mentioned, “The figure is not drawn to scale,” as being applicable to the comic.",,
58,How Did Pythagoras Get into Calvins Homework_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Finally, the question that prompted the most discussion in the class was the one about the triathlon. We actually looked up the information about how the course is planned in terms of moving from one event to the other. Students considered different shaped courses (keeping to polygonal shapes), and researched and computed times and distances, considering mean speeds on real triathlon events. Ultimately, we all learned a great deal and discussed the applications of geometry in an event like a triathlon.",,

62,How Did Pythagoras Get into Calvins Homework_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Making sense of problems and persevering when solving them is a mathematical practice my sixth-grade prealgebra students emphasized that Calvin and Hobbes should develop! Analyzing these cartoon characters’ comical errors gave my students confidence to tackle problems 4 and 6.,,
63,How Did Pythagoras Get into Calvins Homework_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"To calculate the distance for Hobbes, some students added 160 ft. + 360 ft. to arrive at a distance of  520 ft. and then divided the sum by 16 sec. Others calculated the distance by partitioning the problem and finding the portion of each side of the field traveled: 360/16 + 160/16 =  22.5 + 10 = 32.5 sec.",,
64,How Did Pythagoras Get into Calvins Homework_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The triathlon question was tricky for a few students. Some calculated the area of a triangle rather than the hypotenuse. This led to a discussion about looking for meaning in their work. Would calculating area really tell me the distance traveled? Likewise, the time traveled became an interesting discussion when the students converted hours into minutes and seconds. The most common misconception was that some students believed that 0.21 hr. = 21 min. By considering that 0.21 is about one-fifth of an hour, students then recognized that it could not possibly equate to 21 minutes!",,
