"NCTM’s Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for School Mathematics (1989) called for a shift in curricular emphasis for eighth graders in a number of areas. These areas included number and operation sense (integers; rational numbers; using estimation to determine reasonableness of solutions; and understanding ratio, proportion, and percent), algebra (in particular, understanding variables, expressions, and equations), and using geometry and measurement to solve problems (understanding relationships of geometric objects and using estimation in solving measurement problems). The authors of NCTM’s Principles and Standards for School Mathematics (2000) further recognized that within an integrated mathematics curriculum the focus of mathematics instruction would differ by grade-level needs, with number and operations instruction encompassing the majority of instructional emphasis in the primary grades and geometry ",6,mtms2012-04-516a,,

Since the Standards documents  have often been cited in state standards and have influenced the content of multiple textbook series, we conjecture that the curricular shifts suggested in the Standards documents have influenced the content emphases of mathematics taught in U.S. public schools (i.e., early exposure to algebraic thinking, increased emphasis on number sense and estimation, and the integration of geometry and measurement concepts across the curriculum) and have impacted students’ mathematical learning in these areas.",7,mtms2012-04-516a,,

"Educational Progress (NAEP), the federal program that assesses knowledge of students in grades 4, 8, and 12, provides extensive data on the extent to which mathematics performance has changed since the first NCTM Standards were introduced. It also provides insight into instructional trends in school mathematics. Specifically, of the eighth-grade teachers surveyed as part of the 2011 NAEP assessment, 85 percent self-reported a heavy instructional emphasis in algebra and functions and 83 percent self-reported a moderate to heavy emphasis in geometry content. These data suggest that the Standards  documents have had a significant impact on what is emphasized in eighthgrade mathematics classrooms. Has the increased emphasis led to improvement in student performance in these areas? gains in Math achieVeMent",9,mtms2012-04-516a,,
"The NAEP reports scale scores that are similar to SAT or ACT scores in that it is impossible to connect a given score with the number of items a student answers correctly or to interpret exactly what a student knows and does not know. The grade 8 scale scores range from 0 to 500. In 1990, the average NAEP mathematics score for eighthgrade students was 263. By 2011, that score had increased 21 points to 284 (NAEP Data Explorer 2011). Based on the fact that the average score for twelfth-grade students in 1990 was only 31 points higher than the score for eighth-grade students, the gain of 21 points since 1990 is remarkable.",10,mtms2012-04-516a,,
"NAEP also reports scores based on  the percentage of students reaching various predetermined achievement levels. In 1990, only 15 percent of eighth-grade students were at or above the proficient level; however, by 2011, that number had increased to 35 percent. NAEP indicates that “Proficient represents solid academic performance” and “students reaching this level have  demonstrated competency over challenging subject matter” (NCES 2011, p. 7). Thus, although the percentage of students reaching the proficient level is low, those at this level know a substantial amount of mathematics. ",11,mtms2012-04-516a,,
"Another way to think about the gains in mathematics is to compare them with gains in other subject areas. In reading, the only content area that has been assessed as frequently as mathematics, scale scores for eighthgrade students increased from 260 in 1992 (reading was not administered in 1990 or 1991) to 265 in 2011, a mere 5 points. The percentage of students reaching the proficient level in reading went from 29 percent to 34 percent, again, a minimal gain in relation to mathematics. In fact, gains in mathematics since 1990 have been substantially greater than gains in any other subject area assessed (NAEP Data Explorer 2011).",12,mtms2012-04-516a,,
"In addition to reporting overall scores, NAEP reports scores in the following areas: •	 Number	properties	and	operations •	 Algebraic	thinking •	 Geometry •	 Measurement •	 Data	analysis,	statistics,	and	  probability",13,mtms2012-04-516a,,
"Between 1990 and 2011, scores in these areas increased by 14, 28, 21, 21, and 23 points, respectively (NAEP Data Explorer 2011). Although substantial gains occurred in the number properties and operations strand, the gains in the other strands were much greater. As noted previously, the 1989 Standards emphasized changing the way we approach number and operations, but the greatest changes proposed by that document were increased emphasis on algebra and geometry along with data  analysis and statistics. Although simple coincidence can never be ruled out, the data strongly suggest that gains in these areas are a direct result of what NCTM proposed in 1989. In other words, the Standards had an impact on what was covered in textbooks and emphasized by teachers—two factors that contributed to the substantial jumps in performance in these areas.

"Member:  $  8.76 posters0212_518x      MT journal which is based on the types of mathematics that students typically experience in school, the scores of U.S. eighth graders are below those of students in the highest scoring countries but above the	international	average	(Gonzales	et	 al. 2008). This is not a new phenomenon—students in the United States have never done well on international assessments (Loveless 2011; Robitaille and Travers 1992). Although catching up to the highest performing countries is difficult and ambitious, the gains over time on the mathematics NAEP show that eighth-grade students are doing much better than they were before the Standards documents were published. Because NAEP is a survey rather  than an experimental study, it is impossible to argue that the Standards documents are the only, or even the primary, reason for the large gains in performance. Some of the gains could be from increased parental pressure on students to do well in math, increased time in math classes, more in-service programs for teachers, and so forth. Some politicians have claimed that the gains are due to the increased accountability associated with the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act of 2001, although the pattern of gain is exactly the same before and after NCLB was enacted. ",24,mtms2012-04-516a,,
"It is inconceivable, however, that  the Standards have had a negative impact on student achievement. The patterns of gain in mathematics relative to other content areas, along with the gains in areas of mathematics emphasized in the Standards documents (i.e., number sense, algebra, geometry, data analysis), provide strong evidence that the Standards have had a positive impact on student achievement.",25,mtms2012-04-516a,,
"Clearly, plenty of work remains to be done. Helping all students score at the proficient level is ambitious and will take time. In addition, catching up to other countries that are also realizing gains is difficult. NAEP  data show major equity issues—Black and Hispanic students score well below White and Asian American students. The gap is closing slowly if at all (NCES 2011). However, dramatic change in the way we teach mathematics at the middle school level does not make sense in light of NAEP performance data. Math teachers, many using guidance from the NCTM Standards, have made major strides in student learning since the introduction of these documents. Mathematics teachers have reason to be proud of what has been accomplished and need to continue in their efforts to move mathematics instruction in the direction emphasized by NCTM’s Curriculum and Evaluation Standards (1989) and Principles and Standards (2000).",26,mtms2012-04-516a,,
