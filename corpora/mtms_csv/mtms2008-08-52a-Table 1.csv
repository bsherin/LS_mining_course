"The finale of the day involved  sharing a big cake in the shape of a rectangular prism. This activity raised interesting mathematical questions and led to many discoveries and much discussion. Initially, we asked the children to cut the cake and serve it to the guests. They talked about how many pieces they needed and how big each piece should be. As with many children who choose a piece of cake, they wanted more icing. Subsequently, the children and adults began asking questions about the method of cutting the cake, the amount of icing all would get, and the ",5,mtms2008-08-52a,,

"MatheMatical eXPloRations thRoUgh shaRing a caKe Students can be asked to cut and serve pieces of cake to a group of people. Set the stage for the exploration by discussing how big each piece of cake would be and how many pieces are needed. Students will likely agree to make all the pieces equal. At this point, little mathematics is involved except for simple counting and measurement skills. However, as pieces  begin to be distributed, students will likely want pieces with the most icing. The stage is set for several questions: •  Will everyone get the same ",13,mtms2008-08-52a,,

"At our gathering, Soodong (3 years  old), Limmy (a second grader), Joel (a sixth grader), and Lyta (an eighth grader) were in charge of this work. Everyone agreed that the amount of icing per piece would differ once we started cutting. For example, Limmy wanted a corner piece rather than a middle piece because three faces of the corner would be covered with icing. The children investigated the questions by actually cutting the cake, drawing pictures, constructing charts, and communicating verbally. Lyta and Joel led the discussion while the adults asked questions; Limmy and Soodong patiently waited for their pieces of cake. The following activities explore relationships between the number of cuts and the number of faces with icing. ",15,mtms2008-08-52a,,
Activity 1: Cutting the Cake  in One Direction Only	,16,mtms2008-08-52a,,
"This activity helps students identify several initial conditions that set the stage for in-depth investigation. Be sure to explicitly define a cut as being vertical or horizontal from edge to edge. Question 3 on activity sheet 1 leads to an investigation of the impact of the direction of the cut on the number of faces with icing. For example, Lyta and Joel initially made vertical cuts only (see fig. 1) and found some patterns: (1) the number of pieces is always one more than the number of cuts; (2) after the first cut, ",17,mtms2008-08-52a,,
Fig. 2 Joel’s chart illustrates the  possible cases when the total number  of cuts is given.,18,mtms2008-08-52a,,
"there are always two pieces with icing on four faces; and (3) after the first cut, the number of pieces with icing on three faces is always one fewer than the number of cuts. However, Lyta and Joel easily realized that they would not cut in one direction only but would make both vertical and horizontal cuts when they served the cake. At this point, Lyta preferred to use drawings and charts, and Joel explained his reasoning verbally instead of cutting into the actual cake. ",19,mtms2008-08-52a,,
Activity 2: Cutting the Cake Horizontally and Vertically,20,mtms2008-08-52a,,
Part A of activity sheet 2 investigates the different ways the cake can be cut ,21,mtms2008-08-52a,,
"Fig. 3	Lyta’s chart shows a grid for the relationships among the number of cuts, the methods of cutting, and the number of faces with icing.",22,mtms2008-08-52a,,
"both vertically and horizontally. Lyta and Joel noticed two situations when the cake is cut twice: (1) 2 vertical or 2 horizontal cuts are considered one way in terms of the number of pieces and the number of faces with icing and (2) 1 vertical and 1 horizontal cut with an intersection is a second way. In figure 2, Joel charted all the possible ways to make cuts. For example, the possibilities for 2 cuts are 2 vertical and 0 horizontal, 1 vertical and 1 horizontal, or 0 vertical and 2 horizontal. Joel eliminated the last choice because it created the same results as the first choice. After 3 cuts, he did not write all the cutting choices that would eventually be eliminated. After 5 cuts, he was able to determine the total number of cuts (see the circled numbers in fig. 2) based on the pattern he discovered. Lyta had a similar process, as shown in figure 3; rather than write  the number of ways the cake could be cut, she listed the number of pieces obtained for the given number of cuts. ",23,mtms2008-08-52a,,
"When asked the number of ways resulting from 12 cuts, Lyta and Joel answered, “Seven.” When asked about 20, Joel kept counting: “Seven [for 13 cuts], 8 [for 14 cuts], 8 [for 15 cuts], 9 [for 16 cuts], 9 [for 17 cuts], 10 [for 18 cuts], 10 [for 19 cuts], 11 [for 20 cuts]. It is 11.” At this point, an adult asked Joel and Lyta whether they could find the number of cases for 100 cuts. After some discussion, they determined that the number for 100 cuts would be 51. Joel explained: “I looked at the pattern. I found that when the total number of cuts is an even number, we need to divide it by 2 and add 1 to get the number of possible ways. If the total number of cuts is an odd number, we have to add 1 to it and then divide it by 2; 100 is an even number, so the answer is 100 divided by 2, which is 50, plus 1. That is 51.” We asked, “If we cut n times, how many possible ways can we get?” Lyta wrote the following formulas using the letter n:   When n is an even number:  (n ÷ 2) + 1  When n is an odd number:  (n + 1) ÷ 2",24,mtms2008-08-52a,,
Part B of activity sheet 2 helps  students investigate how the number and methods of cutting change the number of faces with icing. ,25,mtms2008-08-52a,,
"Students use the rectangular templates to explore the number of pieces of cake and the number of faces with icing when 2 cuts are made in different ways. With 1 horizontal and 3 vertical cuts, students get eight pieces of cake: four with icing on three faces and four with icing on two faces. With 2 vertical and 2 horizontal cuts, students get nine pieces: four with icing on three faces, four with icing on two faces, and one with icing on one face. Part C encourages students to illustrate other cases. ",26,mtms2008-08-52a,,
"Lyta excluded cutting in one direction only for a practical reason: She would not cut the cake that way for serving. After she completed the computations shown in figure 3, both she and Joel started drawing the top view of the cake (a two-dimensional shape) to explore patterns. ",27,mtms2008-08-52a,,
"Activity 3: Cutting the Cake: Exploring More Patterns Part A of activity sheet 3 helps students find patterns to determine the number of pieces of cake when 10 or more cuts are made. They stopped constructing their charts (see figs. 2 and 3) at 9 cuts, so we wanted to see how they would calculate 10 cuts without using drawings. ",28,mtms2008-08-52a,,
"Lyta and Joel identified different  patterns in the tables. Lyta added 1 to the number of vertical cuts and the number of horizontal cuts, respectively.  horizontal cuts, and nine pieces with 4 vertical and 4 horizontal cuts. Joel concluded that the number of pieces for 5 vertical and 5 horizontal cuts would be sixteen. Additional cases can be explored in part B of activity sheet 3. Figure 4 shows the thirty-two pieces of cake made when there are 7 vertical and 3 horizontal cuts: four with icing on three faces, sixteen with icing on two faces, and twelve with icing on one face.  ideas FoR eXtending  the eXPloRation",29,mtms2008-08-52a,,

"She found that the number of columns of cake is always one more than the number of vertical cuts, and the number of rows is always one more than the number of horizontal cuts. Then, she multiplied these two numbers to find the total number of pieces of cake. For example, 2 horizontal and 8 vertical cuts will make twenty-seven pieces of cake: (2 + 1) (8 + 1) = 27. ",33,mtms2008-08-52a,,
"Joel looked at his previous outcomes when the cake had 1 vertical and up to 8 horizontal cuts. He found that the number of pieces of cake increased by two. Thus, the number of pieces for 1 vertical and 9 horizontal cuts would be twenty: 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18,  and 20. In the same way, the number of pieces of cake for 2 vertical and up to 8 horizontal cuts increased by three: 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, and 27. Joel concluded that the number of pieces for 2 vertical and 8 horizontal cuts would be twenty-seven. ",34,mtms2008-08-52a,,
"After students complete the tables  in part A, ask them to discuss their approaches. This provides an opportunity for students to realize that different strategies can lead to the same solution.",35,mtms2008-08-52a,,
Part B of activity sheet 3 is  designed to help students look for patterns in the number of faces with icing when the cake is cut 10 or more times. Lyta and Joel identified some patterns jointly:  1.  There are always four pieces (the four  corners) with icing on three faces.,36,mtms2008-08-52a,,
"2.  The number of pieces with icing  on two faces will be the same for a given number of cuts, regardless of the way the cuts are made.",37,mtms2008-08-52a,,
3.  The number of pieces with icing on two faces increases by two per additional cut. ,38,mtms2008-08-52a,,
They concluded that for 10 cuts (1) there are always four pieces with icing on three faces and (2) there are always sixteen pieces with icing on two faces. ,39,mtms2008-08-52a,,
Fig. 4	A cake containing	7	vertical cuts and 3 horizontal cuts,40,mtms2008-08-52a,,
"For the number of pieces with icing on one face, Lyta and Joel used different approaches to find patterns. Lyta determined that the number of columns of pieces with icing on one face is one fewer than the number of vertical cuts and that the number of rows of pieces with icing on one face is one fewer than the number of horizontal cuts. The number of pieces with icing on one face was (the number of vertical cuts – 1) × (the number of horizontal cuts – 1); for 4 vertical and 6 horizontal cuts, (4 – 1) × (6 – 1) = 15 pieces that have icing on only one face. Joel used a pattern similar to the one he used previously. He noticed that when only 1 cut is vertical or horizontal and the rest are in the other direction, no pieces have icing on only one face. Then, he arranged the numbers of pieces with icing on one face when he made 2 vertical and 1, 2, . . . , 7 horizontal cuts. The number with icing on only one face would be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. In addition, 2 vertical and 8 horizontal cuts would create seven pieces with icing on one face, and 3 vertical and 7 horizontal cuts would produce twelve pieces with icing on one face. ",41,mtms2008-08-52a,,
"What happens if there are 5 vertical and 5 horizontal cuts? Lyta simply applied her rule: (5 – 1) × (5 – 1) = 16. Joel looked for a pattern when the number of vertical cuts and the number of horizontal cuts were the same: zero pieces with 1 vertical and 1 horizontal cut, one piece with 2 vertical and 2 horizontal cuts, four pieces with 3 vertical and 3  aPPendiX: solUtions to the activity sheets",42,mtms2008-08-52a,,
