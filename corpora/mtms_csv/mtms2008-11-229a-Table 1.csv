"A Social Security number is a nine-digit personal identification number (xxx–xx–xxxx). There are three parts to a Social Security number: the area number (the first three digits), the group number (the fourth and fifth digits), and the serial number (the last four digits). According to the Social Security Administration, or SSA, not all Social Security numbers are valid. According to the SSA, no Social Security numbers with— 1. an area number over 772 have been assigned.",6,mtms2008-11-229a,,

For each of the nine digits in a ,17,mtms2008-11-229a,,
"Social Security number, there are ten choices, specifically, the digits 0–9. That means there are 103 = 1000 possible area numbers; 102 = 100 possible group numbers; and 104 = 10,000 possible serial numbers; which mean a potential 109 = 1,000,000,000 Social Security numbers. Let’s start with the first condition: No Social Security numbers with an area number over 772 have been assigned. The largest area number possible is 999. If we subtract 772 from 999, there are 999 – 772 = 227 area numbers greater than 772. This means that there are 227 invalid area numbers. Each one will have ten choices for each of the remaining digits of the Social Security numbers. From this condition, 227 × 106 = 227,000,000 Social Security numbers are invalid. Let’s look at the third condition  next: No Social Security numbers with an area number of “666” have been or will be assigned. This calculation is similar to the previous one. One value is invalid for the area number, specifically, 666. Each of the remaining six digits will be chosen from 0−9. There are 1 × 106 = 1,000,000 invalid Social Security numbers that begin with 666.",18,mtms2008-11-229a,,
Let’s look at the second condition: ,19,mtms2008-11-229a,,
"No Social Security numbers with  a “000” area number, a “00” group number, or a “0000” serial number have been assigned. If we start with the area number, we know from previous calculations that there will be 1,000,000 invalid Social Security numbers that begin with 000.",20,mtms2008-11-229a,,
"We have already invalidated some of the area numbers, namely, 000, 666, and 773 to 999. The remaining area numbers might have a group number of 00. Since there are 1000 possible area numbers and 229 of them are invalid, 1000 – 229 = 771 area numbers need to be analyzed. Since there are 771 choices for area numbers and only 1 choice for the invalid group number, 00, we have to consider the 104 = 10,000 choices for the serial number: 771 × 1 × 104 = 7,710,000 remaining Social Security numbers will have 00 as the group number. ",21,mtms2008-11-229a,,
"Let’s look at the serial number. From the remaining 771 valid choices for the area number and 99 valid choices for the group number, we only need to account for the 1 invalid choice, 0000, for the serial numbers. This will give us 771 × 99 × 1 = 76,329 Social Security numbers that would have valid area and group numbers and 0000 as a serial number. To find the total number of valid Social Security numbers, see table 1. We subtract the total number of invalid numbers from the 1,000,000,000 possible Social Security numbers. Therefore, 1,000,000,000 − 236,786,329 means that there are 763,213,671 valid Social Security numbers. ● table 1 Totaling the numbers of invalid Social Security numbers 227,000,000 Social Security numbers with 773 to 999 area numbers 1,000,000 Social Security numbers with 666 area number 1,000,000 Social Security numbers with 000 area number 7,710,000 76,329",22,mtms2008-11-229a,,
