0,The Fire Pit (December 2014) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"A local company installs fire pits in residential areas. The basic pit is installed in the center of an 8 ft. Ã— 8 ft. square concrete pad. Some people want larger seating areas around the pit, so the company will add 1 ft. Ã— 1 ft. concrete pavers around the pad. For example, to make a pad that is 12 ft. Ã— 12 ft., builders will add 2 rows of pavers around the 8 Ã— 8 pad, as shown below, by using a 2 foot wide border of pavers.",,
