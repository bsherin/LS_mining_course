Teacher as Musician versus Teacher as Composer,2,mtms2009-09-70a,,
You have probably heard this analogy: Learning math skills without concept development and problem solving is like practicing musical scales and never getting to play music. ,3,mtms2009-09-70a,,
"I like that analogy. Who would deny  1990; Hall and Hord 2006). There is also growing evidence that variation in implementation results in variation in student learning and that closer adherence to the written curriculum often results in greater student achievement (Romberg and Shafer 2008). All this leads me to wonder: When it comes to instructional materials, why do teachers often behave like composers instead of like musicians?",4,mtms2009-09-70a,,
"I first heard this musical analogy at a NSF-sponsored curriculum developers meeting, having since forgotten the name of the presenter. I was intrigued by the analogy’s potential to describe relationships between math teachers and the instructional materials (textbooks) they use. In what ways is the work of a teacher like that of a musician, and in what ways is it like that of a composer? I wondered how far I could push the analogy before it no longer made sense or was useful. I enjoy many styles of music, from country to opera. However, for the sake of this analogy, consider a Beethoven symphony. The scope and complexity of such a musical composition seem to parallel those of a comprehensive mathematics curriculum.  a budding musician the opportunity to play music, and who would deny a budding mathematician the chance to solve problems? It seems ridiculous if not cruel. I have another musical analogy for you to consider about teachers. I offer it in the form of a question: When it comes to using mathematics instructional materials, should teachers resemble musicians or composers?",5,mtms2009-09-70a,,
Part of my work for the past fifteen  years has been to support the implementation of one of the middle-grades curricula whose development was funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF). This work has introduced me to many teachers and many different classrooms. I have seen wide variation in how teachers use the curriculum and the degree to which they implement it as it was designed. There is a growing body of evidence that all curricula are subject to varying degrees of modification by classroom teachers (Ben-Peretz ,6,mtms2009-09-70a,,

Allow me to share some of my  thoughts about this analogy. My hope is that these musings will cause you to think more deeply about the parallels between composers and textbook developers as well as between musicians and teachers.,9,mtms2009-09-70a,,

"Composers create/write/compose music for musicians to perform. Composers are very deliberate when writing a piece of music: Each individual note and musical phrase is carefully chosen. A composer would not write a B flat if it sounded better with a B natural. In a performance, a musician might play a B flat, but everyone who knew the composition would hear and recognize the mistake. When creating music, composers have clear ideas about how their composition should be performed. These “directions” are communicated through such information as the key signature, dynamic markings, tempo instructions in the form of andante and allegro, and repeat markings. Developers of textbooks or units write materials for teachers to use while teaching. I experienced firsthand the thinking, the sequencing of ideas and wording of questions, the field-testing with students, the analyzing of student work, the revising, and the negotiating that go into producing quality, comprehensive materials. ",11,mtms2009-09-70a,,
"The developers of the NSF-funded  curriculum materials had clear goals in mind when they wrote their curricula. Assumptions were made about the knowledge and skills that students would bring to the instructional materials. The units were designed to provide mathematical experiences that will move students along a trajectory of learning toward the goals of the program. The NSF-funded curricula differ in terms of these goals, experiences, and trajectories, but they all have them. Likewise, the  a musician usually plays a piece as written. should math teachers perform a lesson as written? developers had clear ideas about how the materials should be used by teachers. These ideas are carefully documented in the teacher’s guide. A teacher’s guide is considered an essential component of instructional materials, and no school or district would consider adopting these materials without it. In fact, many believe that when it comes to teacher support materials, “more is better.” ",12,mtms2009-09-70a,,
MUsicians/perforMers  and teachers,13,mtms2009-09-70a,,
"Music is written to be performed by musicians. In that sense, composers and musicians are codependent. Composers depend on musicians to bring their music to life; musicians depend on composers to produce music that can be performed. A composer expects professional musicians to carefully prepare before a performance. Musicians who prepare for a public performance study the musical score, play it note by note, repeat difficult passages, listen to the conductor, rehearse with and listen to other musicians, and maintain their instruments. This preparation may take hours, days, or weeks, depending on the complexity of the composition. ",14,mtms2009-09-70a,,
"When classical musicians encounter an unfamiliar piece of music, there is never a question of adaptation. They always play the piece as it was written,  because that is the only way they can know how it sounds. In subsequent performances, a conductor or a soloist might decide to change the key, increase the tempo, add ornamentations, ignore a repeat, or play fewer verses. Some talented performers could improvise variations on a theme but not before playing the piece in its entirety. This is not to say that every time the piece is performed it will sound the same. Different musicians, orchestras, and concert halls will make a piece sound different because of variations in tempo, emphasis, dynamics, instrument quality, or acoustics. In musical performance, these natural variations and interpretations are expected and even desirable. Why else would there be numerous recordings of the same symphony?",15,mtms2009-09-70a,,
"Similar to music, instructional  materials are not self-enacting. The NSF-funded curriculum materials were written to be taught by teachers. The developer and the teacher are co- dependent. Materials developers depend on teachers to bring their ideas to a classroom full of students, and teachers depend on developers to produce their textbooks. The developer expects that, as professionals, teachers will prepare themselves to teach a unit. The teacher prepares by studying the unit as it is written, working through each problem,  repeating difficult ideas to anticipate student misconceptions and errors, reading the suggestions in the teacher’s guide, discussing the lessons with other teachers, and learning new mathematics and teaching techniques as needed. This preparation may take hours, days, or weeks, depending on the complexity and length of the lesson or unit.",16,mtms2009-09-70a,,
The question of fidelity to the composition reveals a startling difference between a musician and a teacher. ,17,mtms2009-09-70a,,
"Whereas a musician encountering  an unfamiliar piece of music always plays it as written, a teacher often adapts materials before teaching them. Fidelity to the curriculum materials is a topic of much research today. Huntley defines fidelity as “Author Intentions + Acceptable Adaptations” (Huntley 2006). For the NSF-funded curricula, author intentions are relatively easy to find. The teacher guides provide a written record of the authors’ intentions about the math, the embedded principles of good learning, and how to use the materials. That assumes, of course, that the teacher guides are in fact read by busy teachers who are trying to meet the needs of many students. ",18,mtms2009-09-70a,,
The second part of the fidelity  definition is unclear. ,19,mtms2009-09-70a,,
"What are acceptable adaptations? When I was a classroom teacher, for the most part I played the music as written. I would generally start teaching on page one of the textbook and work my way through each chapter until I either ran out of book or days in the school year. It was usually the latter. Sometimes I questioned the order of topics, taught one chapter before another, or left out a few sections but only if it made sense mathematically and in terms of prerequisites that were needed. I used the textbook to plan my lessons. ",20,mtms2009-09-70a,,
The typical two-page-spread  format made it easy for me to identify how much would fit into a class period and what I could choose for homework. As the textbook became ,21,mtms2009-09-70a,,
Some teachers play only “Top 40” music  and never expose students to opera.,22,mtms2009-09-70a,,
"more familiar, I would sometimes find confusing explanations or examples but did not hesitate to look for a clearer explanation or a better example to give meaning to the mathematics. I thought that was part of my job as a teacher. I was able to make acceptable adaptations to the “musical score.”",23,mtms2009-09-70a,,
"After first teaching a lesson or unit  as it was written, it is reasonable for teachers to modify contexts to make them more relevant, scaffold questions that need clarity, and identify sections that can be left out. In a musical sense, some teachers will need to “transpose” the lesson to a higher or lower key to make it more appropriate for their students. Other teachers will see possible improvisations that tempt them to go off on their own. Such adaptations should be made only after the original materials are well known. I am not suggesting that individual  teachers cannot or should not make the instructional materials their own. While teaching a lesson as written, different teachers will make it feel different because of variations in pacing; emphasis; individual styles; the timing of the class period relative to the beginning of the day, recess, lunch, and the end of the day; as well as the personalities of the teacher and the class. As with musical performance, these natural variations and interpretations are expected and even desirable.",24,mtms2009-09-70a,,
teachers as coMposers,25,mtms2009-09-70a,,
"Teachers adapt materials and behave more like composers than musicians for a variety of reasons. Some teachers  have the experience and skill to make reasonable adaptations to better meet the needs of their students. These are the “first chairs” of the orchestra. Other teachers may adapt because of a lack of trust in the instructional materials (This will never work!); in the developers (Who are they to tell me what and how to teach?); and in their students (My students will never be able to understand this!). For other teachers, adapting materials is an attempt to make something unfamiliar (I never learned math this way, and I turned out OK) and unsettling (I do not understand this) into something familiar and comfortable. Some teachers might view using materials exactly as written as a form of teacher laziness (Aren’t teachers expected to adapt curricula?). ",26,mtms2009-09-70a,,
"In the years following the release of  the 1989 NCTM Standards, adaptations to previously published materials were expected. In my university methods class, I taught my preservice teachers how to adapt the lessons in their current textbooks to prepare a generation of teachers who were more like composers than musicians. This felt like important and necessary work at a time when few materials matched the vision of Standards-based school mathematics. This was difficult work, because most of us had few firsthand experiences learning mathematics in the way envisioned by the Standards and even fewer experiences with how materials could support our teaching toward these goals. ",27,mtms2009-09-70a,,
"Now that teachers can choose  from several curricula that are closely aligned with the Standards, is it time for teachers to reclaim their primary role as musicians and leave more of the composing to instructional materials developers?",28,mtms2009-09-70a,,
"In addition to the acceptable adap- tors, I have found another group of hard-core adaptors who are difficult to work with when implementing a Standards-based curriculum. They are the seasoned teachers who have file  cabinets full of favorite lessons that they do not want to abandon. They are equivalent to the virtuoso performers who have a vast repertoire of well-practiced pieces. These teachers play from memory, and they play well. I understand them. At one time, I probably aspired to be in their ranks. For many, making adaptations to the instructional materials is not an issue, because they often see no need to teach from the materials at all. ",29,mtms2009-09-70a,,
"I cannot fully address this problem  in the short time that I usually work with a district or school. This is a job for a respected conductor (principal, curriculum supervisor) or even fellow musicians (teachers). ",30,mtms2009-09-70a,,
"However, some hard questions need to be asked of these teachers: •	 Why	is	composing/adapting	so	 highly valued?  •	 Is	your	music	being	heard	and	appreciated by all your students?  •	 Although	parts	of	your	music	are	 good and even great, could there be some missing passages in your score? •	 Might	there	be	value	in	all	the	musicians in the school playing from the same score? ",31,mtms2009-09-70a,,
I will conclude this musical analogy  with a few other thoughts and questions. ,32,mtms2009-09-70a,,
"Producing the audience. If teachers are musicians, who is in the audience in addition to students? ",33,mtms2009-09-70a,,
"Making a connection. With some exceptions, it is safe to say that the audience is interested in the musical performance. Concertgoers are often familiar with the composition and anticipate and eagerly await their favorite parts. During a performance, a connection and interaction occur between musician and audience. How do math teachers make this same connection with their students, with the goal of learning with understanding? ",34,mtms2009-09-70a,,
Receiving feedback. A musician gets feedback in the form of applause or a standing ovation. What do teachers get in response to a well-taught lesson?,35,mtms2009-09-70a,,
Balancing “Top 40” and opera. ,36,mtms2009-09-70a,,
Teachers make decisions about what instructional materials to use on the basis of what they believe students are capable of and need to understand. Some teachers play only music from the “Top 40” and never expose their students to opera. Other teachers take the opposite view. What kind of balance should instructional materials provide?,37,mtms2009-09-70a,,
"Planning sufficiently. The professional musician sight-reads to begin preparing for new pieces of music. Teachers prepare for new lessons by sight-reading the contexts, explanations, and questions and imagining their use in the classroom. What would happen if a musician depended on sight-reading during a public performance? What would happen if a teacher tried to teach without sufficient planning? It might be possible to get by with some instructional materials, but only if the content was at the “Mary Had a Little Lamb” musical level of mathematical complexity.",38,mtms2009-09-70a,,
Being first chairs. We do not all  have to have first-chair skills before we play music. What degree of musicianship is needed before teachers perform publicly? How good of an ear for the music do teachers need?,39,mtms2009-09-70a,,
Teaching from experience. What is the role of experience? Should we expect more experienced teachers to be composers while expecting beginning teachers to strive to be musicians?,40,mtms2009-09-70a,,
"Computing success. If “good music + good performance = a good listening experience,” does it always follow that “good instructional materials + good  teaching = good learning”? If not, what else must go into the equation? ",41,mtms2009-09-70a,,
"How far can we push this musical analogy? Have you thought of other dimensions to add to the analogy? When it comes to using mathematics instructional materials, should teachers be more like musicians or more like composers?",42,mtms2009-09-70a,,
