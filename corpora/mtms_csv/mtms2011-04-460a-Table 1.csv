A variety of approaches and strategies can help English language learners understand and solve mathematical word problems.,4,mtms2011-04-460a,,
"Jane M. Wilburne, Barbara A. Marinak, and Martha J. Strickland  A dalinar receives a large cash donation and uses the funds to double the number of sarps it owns. Then a sarp coshin gives the dalinar 3157 sarps. After this, the dalinar has 48,293 sarps. How many sarps did the dalinar have before the cash donation and gift of sarps?",5,mtms2011-04-460a,,
"Suppose that you were faced with the preceding middle school problem. Although the computation is fairly simple, and you could solve it correctly without knowing what the terms dalinar, sarp, or coshin mean, the unfamiliar context and vocabulary make the problem confusing. Replace dalinar with library, sarps with books, and coshin with collector. The problem may be more understandable because it is now set in a familiar context. This is the challenge that many ",6,mtms2011-04-460a,,
"English language learners (ELLs) and immigrant students face when solving  mathematics problems often found in textbooks or on standardized tests. The language and context of many word problems may be familiar to U.S. students who speak English, but they are often unfamiliar to the evergrowing population of students from different cultures or those who are not fl uent in English. Students who have diffi culty reading, understanding, and solving word problems because of cultural and linguistic differences present challenges to teachers who are working to help every student achieve mathematical profi ciency. ",7,mtms2011-04-460a,,
"In many middle school classrooms, teachers emphasize traditional textbook word problems, which are meant to engage students in solving problems with a real-world context (Verschaffel, Greer, and de Corte 2000). It is important to understand, however, that the real-world context might not be the real world of some students in the class. ",8,mtms2011-04-460a,,
"Since mathematical word problems require students to understand language, culture, the context of the problem, and the mathematics, the problems can be rather complex and often confusing for culturally and linguistically diverse (CLD) students. Thus, today’s middle school teachers are faced with identifying when a traditional word problem may be culturally or linguistically biased and determining ways to help CLD students solve such problems. ",9,mtms2011-04-460a,,
Mathematics teachers must implement “culturally relevant practices” to ensure that all students have access to equitable learning opportunities (NCTM 2008). We relate the instructional strategies used by middle school mathematics teachers who participated in a study that addressed this need. ,10,mtms2011-04-460a,,

"Yielding requested that each teacher discuss the problems that were selected. During this conversation, the teachers responded to two questions:  1.  How are the problems you selected  culturally biased?  2.  How do you handle such problems when they arise in your textbook?  identiFYing cultural Bias",58,mtms2011-04-460a,,
"Throughout our conversations, the teachers shared their insights into how and why they selected the word problems they considered culturally biased. They chose problems that included concepts, words, or phrases that were unfamiliar to CLD students or that considered only the viewpoint of an average U.S. student. ",59,mtms2011-04-460a,,
"In the textbooks, problematic  language included forms of measurement, money, proper nouns (persons, places, and things specific to a country, region, or historical era), and holidays unique to the United States. For example, problems dealing with Old Faithful, Thanksgiving, and the Super Bowl were considered culturally biased because the teachers felt that only students living in the United States would understand the context. ",60,mtms2011-04-460a,,
"The teachers also identified cultural bias when problems included unfamiliar or confusing words or phrases, such as roller coasters, washers in a jar, drawing a counter, down payment, flower bed, and kitchen island. One sixth-grade teacher had a student who asked how an island could be in a kitchen. In another class, a seventh-grade teacher said that a student solved a flower-bed problem by drawing a picture of a bed with flowers growing on it. The teachers described how misunderstanding a word or phrase creates a roadblock for the CLD student. Figure 1 lists problematic words and phrases found in word problems.  diFFerentiating instruction",61,mtms2011-04-460a,,
"After identifying the cultural bias in word problems, the teachers were asked to explain how they handle such issues. Our conversations revealed that the strategies teachers employ fall into two categories:  1.  Promoting understanding of the  mathematical concepts, and  2.  Addressing the culture-specific  vocabulary embedded within the problems. ",62,mtms2011-04-460a,,
"In other words, to differentiate their instruction, the teachers either made revisions to their mathematics instruction or the vocabulary in the problems. ",63,mtms2011-04-460a,,
ProMoting understanding,64,mtms2011-04-460a,,
The mathematics in word problems often requires students to have knowledge of specific concepts as well as an understanding of the mathematical relationships and connections that exist. Students need both conceptual and procedural knowledge (Hiebert 1986) to apply the mathematics and be able to solve the problems. Our conversations revealed instructional strategies that the teachers used to enhance CLD students’ conceptual and procedural knowledge as they worked on word problems. ,65,mtms2011-04-460a,,
"One strategy often used was to provide a diagram or picture of the mathematical concept in the problem. Teachers also supplied manipulatives to scaffold CLD students’ understanding of the mathematical concepts, then discussed the mathematics as students used the manipulatives. These strategies helped students connect the English language to the mathematics.",66,mtms2011-04-460a,,
"Teachers often acted out the  mathematical concepts and modeled the meaning of key words or phrases. For example, a teacher modeled the  meaning of “draw a counter” in a problem that asked students to draw a counter from a bag ten times and find the probability of finding the same color. Other strategies included revising or rewriting a more mathlike problem in a context familiar to the students. One particular problem dealt with finding the area of Madison Square Garden, which is circular. The “Square Garden” part of its official name confused many students, so the teacher changed the problem to “a circular garden.” They also used these situations as teachable moments to introduce culturally diverse students to American culture and English words.  addressing culturallY Biased VocaBularY",67,mtms2011-04-460a,,
"The teachers identified a variety of ways that they help students understand the cultural references that are embedded in the language of the problem. Several indicated that they rewrite problems using different words and remove or replace words without sacrificing the integrity of the specific math concept. For example, one seventh-grade teacher changed a problem that discussed a race between a tortoise and a hare to runner A and runner B. She felt that some of her students would not understand what a tortoise or a hare was and might question why they would run a race. ",68,mtms2011-04-460a,,
"Another seventh-grade teacher changed a problem that described sequoia and General Sherman trees. Apple and pear trees replaced the two varieties. Students who lived on the East Coast were unfamiliar with the former tree variety and questioned who General Sherman was in the problem. This teacher took advantage of the teachable moment to discuss different types of trees, but he also changed the names to help his students focus on the math.  8 strategies to help ells and immigrant students 1. Read problems aloud, pausing after each sentence to allow students time  to think about what was said.",69,mtms2011-04-460a,,
"2. After reading the original version, restate a problem to help students build  their vocabulary and lighten the cognitive demands of the problem.  3. Engage students in a discussion of the cultural issues presented in a problem rather than eliminating or ignoring the issues.",70,mtms2011-04-460a,,
"4. Use manipulatives to represent the mathematics and help students explore mathematical relationships. Encourage verbal discussions as you work with the manipulatives to link language to the mathematics.  5. Use gestures, facial expressions, and visuals to provide cues to the meaning of the problem or vocabulary.",71,mtms2011-04-460a,,
"6. Encourage peer-to-peer assistance, either pairing students with similar cultures or languages or pairing native English speakers with ELL and  immigrant students.",72,mtms2011-04-460a,,
7. Collaborate with ELL colleagues and other mathematics faculty to discuss  ways to accommodate CLD students.,73,mtms2011-04-460a,,
"8. Encourage students to create their own story or word problems, embedding  some element of their own culture.",74,mtms2011-04-460a,,
All the teachers stated they regularly read word problems aloud because so many ELLs struggle to read in English. Reading problems aloud gave teachers an opportunity to ensure that students understood the vocabulary. Pausing between sentences and the main question allowed students time to process the information. ,75,mtms2011-04-460a,,
Making rooM For conVersations,76,mtms2011-04-460a,,
"The teachers grappled with how CLD students relate to the cultural bias and context of word problems. They recognized the need for teachers to hone a cadre of strategies to increase the ability of their culturally and linguistically diverse students to read, understand, and solve math problems. See the sidebar for a summary of these strategies. Each teacher reported using one or more of the strategies discussed in this list. Note that all these strategies involved conversation—a researchbased and powerful tool for negotiating understanding in diverse classroom settings (Villegas and Lucas 2002).",77,mtms2011-04-460a,,
"As teachers recognized the difficulty that some of their CLD students had with understanding either the problems or the vocabulary, they conversed with these students. Using teachable moments, substituting or changing the wording, using manipulatives, and scaffolding concepts were strategies employed to help them understand. ",78,mtms2011-04-460a,,
"Additionally, these teachers sought to connect with their students by discussing the meaning of the words that were misunderstood. They would also substitute words with similar meanings, such as a library, neighborhood blocks, and casserole with a large bookstore, groups of houses, and dinner. This focus on language in conversation is one culturally responsive approach to translating mathematical concepts for student understanding (Barnett-Clark and Ramirez 2004). The teachers also used a number of collaborative strategies to encourage conversation as supported in the research, including grouping CLD students who speak the same language and grouping  ",79,mtms2011-04-460a,,

"Collaborative conversations with  an ESL faculty colleague can also help math teachers create challenging and culturally relevant problems for all students. Forming a professional learning community that works to locate and review mathematics resources beyond textbooks (print, Web-based, and so on) could become a source for identifying math problems free of cultural bias. Pursuing a conversation, focused on the impact of language on students’ mathematical learning, within the professional community can provide opportunities for teachers to reflect on these important issues (Sleeter 1997).",82,mtms2011-04-460a,,

"Multiple cultures are represented in today’s middle school classroom. As a result, today’s mathematics teachers must be able to recognize cultural assumptions embedded in word problems. Teachers should examine their  a “cultural broker,” such as a classmate, can translate difficult language.",84,mtms2011-04-460a,,

"Research suggests several additional strategies for handling cultural bias, which also involve conversation. Villegas and Lucas (2002) noted the importance of dialogue when teaching in culturally diverse settings. Meeting with mathematics colleagues to preview and revise problems is another powerful strategy for eliminating bias  in mathematics problems while maintaining mathematical rigor. ",86,mtms2011-04-460a,,
"Another culturally responsive  strategy that remained untapped by the teachers was intentional dialogue with those familiar with the students’ cultural context. “Cultural brokers” (Leonard 2008), such as family members, students’ friends who have a shared cultural background, and those with more proficient English language ",87,mtms2011-04-460a,,

"Source: Adapted from Carroll et al. (2009)  textbooks and instructional materials to look for culturally biased problems or those that fail to address the ethnic diversity of their classroom (see fig. 2). Once these problems are identified, teachers must consider revising or adapting them to enable all students to comprehend the mathematics rather than grapple with the cultural nuances or difficult vocabulary. Effective mathematics teachers looked for problems that fit their own students’ contexts and applied their pedagogical tools to adapt problems to fit their unique classrooms. ",93,mtms2011-04-460a,,
Our colleagues valued the rigor  of mathematical word problems and were committed to offering the differentiated instruction necessary for all students to learn from these important activities. They embraced the diversity of their classrooms and used these teachable moments in mathematics to bridge relationships and share different ethnic groups’ cultural practices. ,94,mtms2011-04-460a,,
"Clearly, the teacher colleagues  made room for important conversations when faced with cultural bias in mathematics problems. We suggest that all teachers have these conversations and consider inviting others into the conversation, including mathematics and ESL colleagues as well as the family and friends of the CLD students. Conversations are the key to enriching the collaborative learning community focused on equity in the mathematics classroom.",95,mtms2011-04-460a,,
