"A train is composed of an engine and cars of various sizes, ranging in length from 1 unit to 10 units. The cars are placed end to end following the engine of the train. The train is described by the total length of the cars, not counting the engine. For example, all trains below have 4 units. ",4,mtms2012-12-274a,,
"Note: Although all cars of the same length are indistinguishable from one another, the different arrangements of the cars make different trains.",5,mtms2012-12-274a,,
"a. In how many ways can you create a 6-unit train?  b. In how many ways can you create a 10-unit train? c. Determine the number of different ways that you can create a train of unit length n, using an unlimited number of cars of length 1 through length n.",6,mtms2012-12-274a,,
"teacher’s tip: To represent the cars of length 1 to 10, ask students to use Cuisenaire rods, copies of the template (note: see the template that is online with the April 2012 issue), or grid paper to outline cars of various lengths. The template can be printed and cut into separate “train cars” to help students count the possible trains. ",7,mtms2012-12-274a,,

"FroM the classrooM I presented Trains of Thought to my class of sixth-grade gifted students. We had not worked with problems like this, and I had not discussed any problem-solving strategies that would have helped them attack this problem. ",9,mtms2012-12-274a,,
"I drew a 4-unit train on the board (a 2-1-1 train), and students offered other ways that a 4-unit train could be made. The 3-1, 2-2, and 4 train were discussed. However, students had not thought about being able to rearrange the units within the train, so I asked if a 1-2-1 train would be different from a 2-1-1 train. They decided it would be, and quickly found other rearrangements. ",10,mtms2012-12-274a,,
"At this point, I asked the questions  that were presented in the problem: In how many ways could they build a 6-unit, a 10-unit, and an n-unit train? We briefly discussed what an n-unit train meant, and I asked students to devise a rule to determine how many ways were possible to build a train of any size. ",11,mtms2012-12-274a,,
"I mentioned that we had jumped from a 4-unit to a 6-unit train and wondered if we needed to be more systematic about how many units we viewed. One group reported that it had built 5-unit trains and found fourteen possibilities. I suggested that they revisit that conclusion and asked them to look into how many ways they could build a 1-, 2-, and 3-unit train. At that point, groups either continued trying to find all the arrangements for 6-unit trains, starting with 1-unit trains and working with longer and longer trains, or thought only about arrangements of 5-unit trains.",12,mtms2012-12-274a,,
"At the end of the period, several  groups had successfully generated nearly all the arrangements of 6-unit trains, and many groups had found all arrangements of 5-unit trains. I asked students to continue the analysis using the online discussion forum and told them we would talk about the problem the next week. ",13,mtms2012-12-274a,,
"Daniel immediately posted online the patterns his group had found. Another student noticed that the “second number was doubling every time the first number goes up by 1” and asked how to find n. A small number of students discussed the pattern and decided it was not proportional, but it had a pattern of some sort. One ",14,mtms2012-12-274a,,

"I gave the students no direction  as to beginning the task. All but one group started by making random arrangements. One group used Cuisenaire® Rods. These students started with the ones and then worked with the twos and ones, but within their rearrangement of the latter group, no system was apparent (see fig. 1).",17,mtms2012-12-274a,,
"After about ten minutes, I stopped  the class and asked students how many ways they had found for the 6-unit train. The answers ranged from twelve to thirty-five possibilities. Students admitted that there were a lot of ways to arrange the trains and that they were unsure how to know if they had found all the possibilities. They were also unable to determine any patterns from the combinations we were working on.  snap cubes represented trains without the car length being obvious.  students worked with cuisenaire rods and recorded their findings.",18,mtms2012-12-274a,,
"student posted all his 5-unit arrangements, but no one could devise a rule for the nth train. I posted a question to the online forum:   Can you describe the number of ways for each train in terms of the preceding train? Also, consider reorganizing your list so that it is in order by number of cars needed.",19,mtms2012-12-274a,,
"This question helped more students see the recursive pattern. Daniel suggested the formula was 2n, then revised it to 2(n-1) when he realized that he was off by a factor of 2. I asked if anyone could verify his rule, and several did, but they were bothered by the fact that the rule implied that 20 was 1. ",20,mtms2012-12-274a,,
"In class the next week, many students shared that they had made a list or drawing of the 32 ways to make a 6-car train (see fig. 2). After students worked in their groups briefly, I asked Daniel to share what he had found, and we discussed his pattern. We drew a t table on the board so that students could view what was happening. The pattern of doubling the number of arrangements was easy for students  to see; finding an explicit rule for the nth train was more difficult, but many finally understood Daniel’s thinking.",21,mtms2012-12-274a,,
"Students continued to be bothered by the fact that 20 = 1, so we looked  at the pattern going backward from 512, 256, 128, . . . to 2. I asked students what was happening each time, and they articulated that we were dividing the preceding number by  2. I asked if the pattern held for 20. They agreed that it did and that 20 was 1. Nick then asked if that meant that 2-1 would be 1/2, and many students agreed that if the pattern held, this would be true.",22,mtms2012-12-274a,,
"After presenting this problem, I  had several thoughts:  1.  I need to present more problems similar to this one and help students develop problem-solving strategies.  2.  Although I asked students to  record their progress, I have been fairly unsuccessful in getting them to do it. I need to provide explicit instructions to help them organize their thinking better.",23,mtms2012-12-274a,,

"Fig. 2 Illustrating the various permutations of trains helped students visualize potential solutions to 6-unit, 10-unit, and n-unit trains.",25,mtms2012-12-274a,,
haphazard colors on the snap cubes impeded students’ ability to see if they had found all possible arrangements.,26,mtms2012-12-274a,,
"4.  The group that did not use ma- nipulatives was the first to successfully find the pattern. I wonder if the use of manipulatives impeded the other groups? What caused this group to work symbolically? Could the solution be attributed to the specific members of that group and not to the decision to forego using manipulatives?  5.  I like the idea of being able to  continue class discussions online, and I think it has potential, but I need to think more deeply about how to accomplish this with students who have limited access to technology outside of school.",27,mtms2012-12-274a,,
reFlection on the task,28,mtms2012-12-274a,,
"Salls’s experience exemplifies what can happen when we ask students to solve complex problems. It is meaningful to the Solve It! task designers that Salls realized the value of this problem after watching her students work and listening to their analyses. When a teacher asks her students to attack problems, rather than the teacher standing before them and drilling a set of skills, students will often address many of the Content Standards we would normally teach. In so doing, they will often discover new mathematical ideas on their own. This situation was clearly the case with Salls’s students as they discovered that 20 = 1 and that 2-1 = 1/2. Such discoveries will definitely aid in deepening their understanding of mathematics. If students had developed their lists more systematically, it could have led to additional discussions or connections with Pascal’s triangle and binomial distributions. We applaud Salls for giving students a choice of manipulatives and also allowing them to work without  them if they desired. We definitely agree that Cuisenaire Rods are much more appropriate than snap cubes for this task. But making an appropriate choice of a manipulative and recognizing if it is helpful or not are skills that students should develop as part of their mathematical modeling skill set. The group that chose not to use manipulatives drew pictures of their trains, then began working symbolically as they saw patterns emerge.",29,mtms2012-12-274a,,
"However, many middle school  students are not successful with simply drawing pictorial representations of a situation and must physically manipulate blocks to see the various possible arrangements. It may be that students who choose to work symbolically are better at visualizing the item in their heads and do not need to actually move pieces around to “see” the different groupings. Again, the importance of the manipulatives was to offer students a choice: deciding when to use them, realizing which ones were beneficial in solving the task, or choosing not to use them.",30,mtms2012-12-274a,,
"Many students are comfortable communicating with technology, and its use presents another potential layer of student understanding. However, Salls’s concerns are valid. If all students do not have access to technology outside the classroom or school, then the online discussions leave them out, and they automatically miss an integral part of the  learning experience. Replicating part of the online discussion in a followup class session will help, but the students who participated online will quickly lose interest if they are merely repeating the same discussions. There is no simple solution to this problem. Until we find an equitable way to provide all our students with the same technologies outside the classroom, their use will need to be approached thoughtfully.",31,mtms2012-12-274a,,
"We would like to thank Jennifer Salls of Clayton Middle School in Reno, Nevada, for her comments and reflections. We also wish to thank Daniel, her student, as well as the other students who completed this task.",32,mtms2012-12-274a,,
