"One student begins to write some passwords as they come to mind, producing the list in figure 1. Does it include all possible passwords? How can you tell? Does the list help efficiently answer such questions as “How many of the words start with an A?” or “What is the probability that a word will have a B and a C next to each other?” ",11,mtms2012-10-132a,,
"Tasks like the one described above, in which the goal is to determine how  many possibilities exist for a given situation, are called counting problems. They fall under a branch of mathematics called combinatorics. Counting problems are straightforward to state and understand, but can be surprisingly complex to solve. They have significant applications in computer science and probability and are appearing more frequently in middle school math curricula. NCTM (2000) indicates that discrete topics (which include counting problems) are important, noting that, “discrete mathematics should be an integral part of the school mathematics curriculum” (p. 31).

Students can move from randomly generating possibilities toward more refi ned strategies of systematically listing these outcomes (e.g., English 1991, Piaget and Inhelder 1975). In high school and college mathematics, this act of counting can look quite different and can become a matter of memorizing formulas, identifying key words, or matching problems to formula types to determine the number of possible results. Unfortunately, as counting problems increase in complexity and are no longer contingent on a key word or a certain type, students who rely on such triggers can be unsuccessful. There is evidence that students face diffi culties when they have not had experience with generating sets of outcomes (Lockwood 2011). Middle school, therefore, presents a prime opportunity to lay the foundation for helping students recognize the importance of generating and organizing sets of outcomes.  geneRating and oRganiZing oUtcoMes",27,mtms2012-10-132a,,
The way in which a person solves a counting problem is intrinsically linked to the set of outcomes. Different counting processes lead to organizing possibilities in different ways. Middle school teachers can draw on students’ natural tendencies to generate lists of possibilities to help students understand what they are counting when they solve a counting problem. ,28,mtms2012-10-132a,,
"Consider again the counting  problem about three-letter passwords. Instead of randomly writing down letters (see fi g. 1), students could work toward a systematic listing by picturing the three positions of each letter.

"be an A, B, or C, the set of possible passwords can be systematically generated. Using a counting tree diagram (see fi g. 2) can help students see how this counting process generates the resulting list of possibilities. However, it is not the only viable solution. Because of the nature of the  counting process (considering the choices for the fi rst, second, then third positions), the list of outcomes could also be organized alphabetically (see fi g. 3a). Students could also break the problem into cases, organizing combinations according to the number of distinct letters that appear in a particular password (see ﬁ g. 3b). Students could fi rst consider the passwords with one letter appearing repeatedly (all As, all Bs, or all Cs). Next they could consider possible outcomes with ",31,mtms2012-10-132a,,

Finally, students could consider passwords with all three letters appearing. This example, involving two different ways of organizing the set of passwords, illustrates the fact that students’ counting processes can generate and organize outcomes.",55,mtms2012-10-132a,,
"Unlike a random list, in which it can be difficult for a student to tell if a certain word has been missed or repeated, being able to generate a systematic list allows students to determine if the list contains all the passwords. Such lists can support a justification for why the proposed number of outcomes is accurate. If the foundation is laid for students to explicitly relate their counting activity to the set of outcomes, they are better equipped to face more complicated problems with large numbers.

"If middle school students develop the skill of generating outcomes, they may be less likely to use memorized formulas in a rote way when they get to high school or college. Students will become more confident and successful at counting if they develop systematic ways of listing possible results and can clearly tie the generation of those results to counting processes. Consider the following three specific ways of developing an awareness of and an appreciation for being able to generate and organize outcomes in a middle school classroom setting.  1. Establish What Is Being Counted Clearly identifying what is (and is not) being counted is a vital aspect of successful counting. Before trying to solve the problem, it can be helpful for students to articulate what they are trying to count. Doing so can help them avoid unnecessary errors. For example, if students are asked,  In how many ways can you  choose a pair of hall monitors  from 8 people?  they should realize that the pair Rick and Sara is the same as Sara and Rick. Recognizing that they want to count pairs of students, and not an arrangement of those students (order does not matter), can help them avoid overcounting the outcomes. ",58,mtms2012-10-132a,,
"By establishing the objects being  counted (such as pairs of students or three-letter passwords), students can better understand what is being asked of them. They are also more likely to avoid errors that might arise from blindly applying incorrect formulas. To foster a focus on generating and organizing outcomes, teachers might explicitly ask students to first list three examples and then three nonexamples of desirable possibilities when they approach a counting problem. Students should also get in the habit of stating, either in writing or verbally, what exactly they are trying to count.  2. Focus on a Systematic Listing As students eventually encounter powerful and efficient formulas for counting outcomes, they may dismiss the concrete, systematic listing as being unsophisticated. While formulating habits for what counting problems are asking mathematically, students should continue to engage in generating and organizing outcomes. Doing so will help them ground their counting activity meaningfully in concrete sets of outcomes and enable them to recognize and avoid potential errors. One practical tip is to give students some experience with listing complete sets of possibilities, such as for the  following problem:   How many ways can four students ( John, Kyle, Luke, and Martha) stand in line for recess? ",59,mtms2012-10-132a,,
This is an example of a manageable task for constructing a complete and organized list of outcomes. Shortcutting the step of listing all possibilities too early can prevent students from reinforcing the connections between their counting strategies and the outcomes they generated. Students could also be encouraged to compare their lists with their classmates and discuss the efficiency or elegance in generating those lists.,60,mtms2012-10-132a,,
"Completely listing all outcomes is not always feasible, and students will, at some point, inevitably encounter problems for which all possibilities cannot easily be generated. An example of this is the following:  How many ten-character  identification (ID) numbers  can be made using the  digits 1 to 9? ",61,mtms2012-10-132a,,
"Although it is impractical to list all the ID numbers (especially since the list numbers over three billion, in this case), a student could still draw on prior experience with systematic listings from a smaller problem to gain insight into a more complex, or larger, version.  3. Connect Different Counting Processes to Different Ways of Organizing Outcomes Envision a classroom discussion in which two different groups of students used two different strategies to solve a counting problem. A teacher could take advantage of such a situation by encouraging each group to show how its respective approaches relate to how they organized the set of outcomes. If the two strategies yield the same set of outcomes, their strategies should each be accomplishing the same task. The three-letter password example discussed earlier demonstrates this. As another example, consider the following:",62,mtms2012-10-132a,,
"Fig. 4 Different approaches to listing the 36 results of rolling two dice can be tied to one another.  1-1  1-2  1-3  1-4  1-5  1-6 2-1  2-2  2-3  2-4  2-5  2-6 3-1  3-2  3-3  3-4  3-5  3-6 4-1  4-2  4-3  4-4  4-5  4-6 5-1  5-2  5-3  5-4  5-5  5-6 6-1  6-2  6-3  6-4  6-5  6-6 (a) A 6 × 6 array   1-1  1-2  1-3  1-4  1-5  1-6  2-1  3-1  4-1  5-1  6-1   2-2  2-3  2-4  2-5   3-2  4-2  5-2    3-3  3-4 4-3     2 7  6-6 4-6  5-6 6-4  6-5 5-5  2-6  3-6 6-2  6-3 3-5  4-5 5-3  5-4 4-4  10  11  12  (b) Eleven columns sorted by sums  JD is playing a game. He rolls two dice, one green and one red. What are all the different possibilities he could have rolled?",63,mtms2012-10-132a,,
"One student may approach the  problem by combining all 6 possibilities on the green die with the 6 possibilities on the red die. This student could list the outcomes in an array by starting with 1-1, 1-2, . . . , 1-6; then 2-1, 2-2, . . . , 2-6; and continuing through 6-1, 6-2, . . . , 6-6. When completed, the student should have produced a list of 36 roll combinations (see fig. 4a). Another student may have approached the problem by considering the different possible totals (2 through 12) that could appear on two dice. This student could list the outcomes in eleven columns, with the number of ways of summing to 2, 3, 4, . . . , up to 12 (see fig. 4b). ",64,mtms2012-10-132a,,
Both of the solutions processes and  answers in figure 4 are correct. This highlights a situation in which two different approaches to the counting problem yield different ways to organize the same set of results. Discussing such a situation with students will impress on them the fact that their counting procedures are fundamentally linked to generating and organizing the set of outcomes. ,65,mtms2012-10-132a,,
"Other interesting connections  exist between different ways of organizing the set of outcomes. In the example above, the pairings in the eleven columns in figure 4b can be seen in the diagonals of the array in figure 4a, although reordered in the diagonal. Although this relationship might not be clear to students who generated the respective strategies, this connection could be raised by the teacher, fostering meaningful discussion in the classroom about how the two solutions are related to each other.",66,mtms2012-10-132a,,
conclUsion,67,mtms2012-10-132a,,
"When teaching counting, it can be tempting to gloss over an examination of the actual set of possible results in favor of teaching more efficient formulas, tricks, or use of key words. However, students can benefit from grounding their counting processes  in generating and organizing sets of outcomes. To develop confident and capable counters, teachers can leverage middle school students’ natural tendencies to list sets of possibilities. When your middle school students are assigned to write all the outcomes for a counting problem and ask, “Do I really have to list them all?” you should respond with a resounding “Yes!” At some point, students will outgrow the need to list all outcomes. Until then, it is absolutely essential for them to engage in the process of systematically listing all information so as to strengthen the connection between the counting process and the set of outcomes.",68,mtms2012-10-132a,,
