"During 2004’s presidential election, voters could choose between incumbent George W. Bush (Republican) and John Kerry (Democrat). That year, I had the opportunity to work  grade students on an Electoral College investigation. My  with several classes of eighth- students’ prior knowledge of this institution edge of this institution was limited. During was limited. During our fi rst discussion, our fi rst discussion, they were surprised they were surprised to discover that to discover that their home state of their home state of North Carolina was North Carolina was historically a “red historically a “red state” and that all its state” and that all its electoral votes would electoral votes would go to a single candigo to a single candidate on Election Day.",3,mtms2012-09-118a,,

"An overarching goal of education is to prepare students to be informed and engaged citizens. Currently, more than one-third of Americans do not understand the Electoral College and the role that it plays in the election process (Ross 2009). The 2000 election was notable for its controversy: Although Al Gore won the popular vote, George W. Bush won the Electoral College vote and, therefore, the election. Although the 2004 election was not similarly notable, a knowledge of the Electoral College enabled my students to engage in the presidential election. As a result, they understood the mathematics of the process and became better-informed citizens. Engaging in these tasks with your students will prepare them for Election Day, even though they are too young to vote.  eXPloRing electoRal college Math",6,mtms2012-09-118a,,

Their enthusiasm the day after the election was palpable because students had understood the process as it unfolded. I remember one student saying to me, “I saw all those red and blue states come up, and I knew what it meant!” Two class  is to understand the computation behind each candidate being able to procure enough electoral votes to win the election. This activity requires simple addition, subtraction, and comparison of whole numbers. Calculator use is probably warranted; there are several numbers to add, and students could potentially lose track of them.",8,mtms2012-09-118a,,
"It is impossible for us to predict with certainty how the election map will appear close to Election Day. In addition, various sources may predict states’ voting differently, so answers will depend on the individual state analyzed as well as the source used in the classroom. Regardless, it is important to present data that do not produce a landslide win for either candidate so that students can consider the multiple ways that the election may be won or lost. The target quantity is 270; the candidate earning 270 electoral votes will win the election.",9,mtms2012-09-118a,,
"Question 5 on activity sheet 1  gives students the opportunity to use the data they have analyzed to suggest candidates’ campaign strategies. They may consider which states are most likely to swing toward one candidate or the other as well as the electoral vote weight of individual states for launching a final campaign push. Of course, there is no right answer, and the staff of each campaign will surely consider additional factors when making these decisions. This thread of discussion can be pulled in class to identify additional information or variables that might be significant to campaigns.",10,mtms2012-09-118a,,
"If adequate time is available, ask  students to consider the possibility of a tie between candidates, with each garnering 269 electoral votes—an unlikely but possible scenario.  Students might search for combinations of swing states that would create an electoral vote tie; parsing electoral votes from Maine and Nebraska can also assist with this endeavor. Finally, it would be worthwhile for ",11,mtms2012-09-118a,,
Basics of the electoral college,12,mtms2012-09-118a,,
"Every four years, U.S. citizens go to the polls to vote in a presidential election. This November, voters will either re-elect President Barack Obama (the Democratic candidate) for a second term in office or elect Mitt Romney (the Republican candidate) to succeed him in the White House. The popular vote does not decide the election because the United States adheres to the tenets of the Electoral College, which grants to states a specific number of electoral votes. This quantity is determined for each state by summing the number of representatives in the House of Representatives (which is based on population) and the two senators in the United States Senate. ",13,mtms2012-09-118a,,
"State legislatures determine who serves as an elector; an elector cannot be a member of Congress or hold a federal office. In December, the electors of each state meet to vote for president and vice president. The electors use the results of the popular election to determine their vote. With the exception of Maine and Nebraska, which can split their votes between candidates, all states grant all their electoral votes to a single candidate. A candidate needs 270 electoral votes to win the presidency. If no candidate receives a majority of electoral votes, the House of Representatives elects the president from the 3 candidates who received the most electoral votes. States are typically dubbed blue states (predominantly Democrat) or red states (predominantly Republican) on the basis of how their electoral votes will most likely be cast. ",14,mtms2012-09-118a,,
"Mandating the Electoral College system was one of the most difficult  decisions made by the Constitutional Convention in 1787 (Rothwell 2001). By using electors to vote, the founding fathers were hoping to avoid voting by “mob rule” as well as for favorite sons (a locality’s nominee). In addition, smaller states were hesitant to endorse a direct popular election because it would limit their power and voice in the election. Turner (2007) has argued that the current Electoral College system promotes compromise and government moderation. Some people, however, want to abandon the Electoral College and adopt a purely popular election, pointing both to advances in wider communication and greater knowledge and the fact that a candidate can potentially win the popular vote and not win the election (Clayton 2007). ",15,mtms2012-09-118a,,
"Changes to the Electoral College process have occurred over time, particularly with the passing of the 12th Amendment in 1804 (Rothwell 2001). Before 1804, electors could cast two votes, with the expectation that they would use one vote for the president and one vote for the vice president. This proved problematic in the 1796 and 1800 elections when electors used both votes for the president and there were too few votes cast to elect the vice president (Turner 2007). Currently, electors cast one vote for president and one vote for vice president. Since 1804, many proposals for changing the presidential election process have been introduced, such as a direct popular election; to date none have been passed by Congress and sent to the states for ratification (Clayton 2007). Thus, it is important for all citizens, including students, to understand how the electoral system works.  students to research what would happen in the event of an electoral vote tie. The website About.com clearly describes what happens if a tie throws the election into the House of Representatives and the Senate (see http://usgovinfo.about.com/od/ thepoliticalsystem/a/electiontie.htm).

"Activity sheet 2 explores how the  number of electoral votes is determined for each state. This activity is more appropriate for students in grades 7 and 8 because it involves  creating a scatterplot, sketching a trend line, and making predictions on the basis of the trend line. ",17,mtms2012-09-118a,,
"Consider the resulting scatterplot for the 25 states (selected for question 1) in ﬁ gure 1. The individual data points demonstrate a remarkably linear relationship. It is not challenging for most students to sketch a trend line for the data points. Because of the  substantial numerical variation in state populations, using the trend line to predict a state’s population from the number of electoral votes is diffi cult and inexact (question 3).",18,mtms2012-09-118a,,
"However, using a state’s population to predict the number of electoral ",19,mtms2012-09-118a,,
Fig. 1 A scatterplot using the population and electoral votes for 25 states shows a direct relation that can be represented by the linear equation y = 0.0014x + 2.0039.,20,mtms2012-09-118a,,
"Fig. 2 The numbers in this cartogram, illustrating electoral votes by state, were based on 2010 census data (Colley and Gott 2011).  votes is more precise, and students ought to be able to generate a prediction within a few electoral votes (question 2).The actual line of best fi t generated by Excel for these 25 states is y = 0.0014x + 2.0039.",21,mtms2012-09-118a,,
"The model demonstrates some meaningful connections to how the number of electoral votes is determined for the individual states (see ﬁ g. 1). Consider fi rst the slope of the linear equation, 0.0014. In context, this is the number of electoral votes awarded to a state for every 1,000 residents. Therefore, for every 1,000,000 residents, approximately 1.4 electoral votes are awarded. ",22,mtms2012-09-118a,,
"Basing electoral votes on population alone would diminish the infl uence of states with smaller populations. Consider 2.0039, the y-intercept of the equation. In this equation for the line of best fi t, this number refers to the Electoral College votes that are awarded in addition to those based on the state’s population. Note how close this value is to 2, which is the actual number and based on the number of senators allotted for each state. Of course, error is associated with the line of best fi t. From these equations, it might be interesting to examine which states benefi t with a greater number of Electoral College votes, as well as which states lose out.",23,mtms2012-09-118a,,
"An intriguing extension is provided  at the end of activity sheet 2. Cartograms depict statistical information in a distorted, diagram-like representation. The cartogram in ﬁ gure 2 represents Electoral College votes by numbered and colored squares. This map of the United States is distorted because population (rather than land area) is a substantial contributor to the size of the state on the cartogram. For example, examine Alaska and Montana, two of the four largest states in the United States by  area. Both appear quite small in the cartogram because they have very low population densities and each has only 3 electoral votes. In contrast, Rhode Island is the smallest state by area, yet appears larger than Alaska or Montana because of its high population density. Other cartograms are equally intriguing as depictions of 2008 election results (e.g., explore the website http://www-personal.umich.edu/~ mejn/election/2008/).",24,mtms2012-09-118a,,
conclusion,25,mtms2012-09-118a,,
"Preparing students mathematically to make sense of the Electoral College engages them in a process that is vital to our democracy. Although they are unable to vote, they will—like my own students eight years ago—watch the results with enthusiasm and understanding. These tasks will prepare them not only for this presidential election but also for future elections in which they are able to vote. This activity will also help them understand how individual votes influence a larger process.",26,mtms2012-09-118a,,
