"Students are often encouraged to work on problems “like mathematicians”—to be persistent, to investigate different approaches, and to evaluate solutions. This behavior, regarded as problem solving, is an essential component of mathematical practice. Some crucial aspects of problem solving include defining and interpreting problems, working with different solution methods, verifying solutions, and drawing conclusions (NCTM 2000). Students typically, however, are not encouraged to pose problems or carefully and critically analyze and reformulate the problems that they are given or that they find in textbooks (Brown and Walter 1983). ",6,mtms2012-09-86a,,
"Problems present and contain situations. Word problems usually present scenarios that carry various implicit assumptions. For example, calculating  a train’s arrival requires its departure time, the distance traveled, and the speed of the train. This problem contains several tacit assumptions:  •	 The train will not break down.",7,mtms2012-09-86a,,

"Students have to infer relevant missing information to interpret the problem and solve it successfully. By factoring their assumptions—even the ones held unconsciously—into the given data, students are reformulating the initial problem. ",12,mtms2012-09-86a,,
"The assumptions that play a part in  such interpretations are often considered common sense and are rarely discussed explicitly. However, different students might rely on different assumptions in making sense of a problem situation, which can lead to different reformulations of the problem and solutions. Therefore, learning to critically identify and evaluate assumptions should be an essential part of students’ strategic competence in math problem solving (i.e., the ability to formulate, represent, and solve mathematical problems) (NRC 2001). Helping students become aware of the role that their assumptions play in mathematical problem solving is an essential attribute of critical thinking. ",13,mtms2012-09-86a,,
"It is recommended that students grapple with rich, well-structured problems that allow multiple paths for problem solving. This grappling will enable students to explore and discuss alternative ideas (NCTM 2000). Frederiksen (1984) makes a distinction between well-structured, clearly defined problems that can be solved using one or multiple methods and ill-structured, unclear problems that require clarification before a solution can be devised. Unclear problems contain elements that are unspecified or ambiguous; these problems require that students reformulate the problem statement before a solution can be attempted. Sketchily formulated and fuzzy problems can have pedagogical value in the classroom, however. Students can be asked to interpret and reformulate the initial problem, identify and analyze their classmates’ assumptions, and trace the relations between assumptions made and solutions considered. ",14,mtms2012-09-86a,,
THE PROJECT,15,mtms2012-09-86a,,
"To explore students’ assumptions, a math teacher decided to devote one period per week during the year to word problem discussions. Her objective was for the problem solving to be performed collaboratively, within a community of inquiry, in which students were expected to state their mathematical ideas and offer supporting evidence. Her role was to orchestrate and manage students’ contributions. She also promoted a caring-for-ideas disposition by helping students restate, clarify, and build on one another’s arguments. She modeled this practice and coached students on how to identify and evaluate unstated assumptions and how to reach consensus about reasonable solutions. She also helped her students understand how assumptions provide information about a problem’s solution. The excerpts presented below are characteristic of this collectivework process. The following problem launched the discussion: ",16,mtms2012-09-86a,,
"A frog finds itself at the bottom of a 30-foot well. Each hour, it climbs 3 feet and slips back 2 feet. How many hours would it take the frog to get out? ",17,mtms2012-09-86a,,
FOCUSING ON ASSUMPTIONS: A CLASS DISCUSSION,18,mtms2012-09-86a,,
"After the problem was presented to the class, suggestions immediately emerged. The teacher asked students to present and justify their positions. Sidney thought that the frog would need 30 hours to get out of the well, since “every hour it climbs up 3 and goes down 2 feet, so it climbs only 1 foot [per hour]” (see fig. 1a). This position was challenged by Victor, who suggested that after 28 hours the frog could be out since “it won’t have more to climb” (see fig. 1b). It was obvious from the discussions that students read and interpreted the ",19,mtms2012-09-86a,,

"Summing up the positions and  their underlying assumptions made it easier for students to track and reflect on them. The students knew that they were expected to work together to examine all identified assumptions and make a judgment. To that end, they spent considerable time clarifying and interpreting ambiguities. They discussed what was meant by “the frog to get out” and whether the problem implies that once out, the frog could slide back into the well. It was unclear when the getting out was going to occur.",33,mtms2012-09-86a,,
"Students had difficulty making  sense of the problem situation. Some thought that the frog might get out of the well in less than 30 hours but then it “needs” to go back; assuming otherwise would violate the problem’s conditions, they thought. Others thought that the frog’s goal was to get out and that there was no reason to assume that it would slide back. The students also noted considerations such as whether the frog siderations such as whether the frog needed some sleep during this long needed some sleep during this long climbing period.

The teacher incorporated Chas’s  and Victor’s suggestions and reformulated the question to be more specific. Students saw that Sidney’s assumption was now irrelevant. ,43,mtms2012-09-86a,,
"While the students were grappling with clarifying the problem, the teacher encouraged the group to express their ideas, agree and disagree with their peers, and give reasons. She often articulated assumptions, for example, “Nellie is assuming that it’s in the problem’s conditions that starting at the 27th foot and climbing up 3 feet the frog will be out of the well, but then it will slide back in.” Her comments mediated between different students’ positions, thus helping the students reach consensus. She focused students’ attention on certain issues by asking clarifying questions, summarizing discussions, paraphrasing comments, and connecting ideas:",44,mtms2012-09-86a,,
Assumptions buried deep in the statement of a problem can make a distinct difference to the final solution.,45,mtms2012-09-86a,,
"Once the question was reformulated, the problem discussion moved to an exploration of possible solutions. Two suggestions had been given so far: 28 hours and 30 hours. The solution of 30 hours was rejected because it was associated with Sidney’s then-discounted assumption that the frog was going back in the well once it reached the surface. It appeared for a while that the only convincing answer was 28 hours. Then another new turn and another plausible solution were presented, reflecting a different assumption about the frog’s mode of climbing:",46,mtms2012-09-86a,,

"Teacher: OK, so we have several possible interpretations of the problem, depending on what we assume about how the frog climbs. Who could summarize the conclusions that we’ve reached so far? Nora?",56,mtms2012-09-86a,,

"These excerpts portray how the group dealt with understanding and solving an ambiguous problem that allowed for different interpretations, and thus solutions, because of a lack of specifics. Each interpretation of the original problem was aligned with an associated set of assumptions. The interpretation and the corresponding solution became apparent when the assumptions were identified and clarified. The discussion zigzagged  between negotiation of the problem formulation and reflection on and evaluation of the proposed solutions and justifications. ",58,mtms2012-09-86a,,
"A BRIEF SUMMARY OF ANOTHER DISCUSSION By way of further illustration, here is another problem the class encountered: ",59,mtms2012-09-86a,,
A clock strikes 6 times in 5 seconds. How long would it take the clock to strike 12 times? ,60,mtms2012-09-86a,,
"The problem did not specify whether the strokes were produced in equal time intervals or how the time was counted. Many different assumptions were broached. Students observed that different clocks might have different chiming patterns. Mark remarked that we did not know whether the clock would continue silently after the first 6 strokes. Rashaad then suggested that we assume that the clock chimed once every second on the second; such a clock, he thought, would sound 6 times in 5 seconds. This statement was accepted and followed by a discussion about when the count began: with or after the first stroke. ",61,mtms2012-09-86a,,
"Some students thought that the  clock chimed first, and then the time count began, since “The stroke says now the next second begins.” Following on this assumption, Vincent said, “I think the total time [for 12 strokes] is 11 [seconds]. The stroke is per second. The clock strikes and then the time [count] starts. It counts as 1 second when it strikes the second time, 2 seconds when it strikes a third time . . . and so I think it’s 11 [seconds].” ",62,mtms2012-09-86a,,
"Other students thought that the time count should start with the first stroke. “It’s a clock,” Rashaad argued, “so it does everything at the same time. It’s not like the brain . . . it’s not like it’s going to think first and then do something. If you just do 6 times 2 is 12 . . . if you just double . . . and 5 times is 10, so. . . .” The teacher encouraged the students to agree or disagree with the presented positions and the reasoning supporting them. Several students agreed with Rashaad’s solution at first. Sara used her fingers to explain: “Here are 5 fingers on your hand and only 4 spaces. How many spaces are there between 6 fingers? [She held her fingers wide open.] That’s 5. If you have another 6 [strokes], that will be 5 more spaces, so there will be 10 spaces altogether” (see fig. 2a). Casey agreed with both and offered to show his representation. He drew 2 segments above each other, each divided into 5 equal parts (see fig. 2b). “Two times 6 is 12 and 2 times 5 is 10, so [it takes] 10 seconds.” ",63,mtms2012-09-86a,,
"The teacher encouraged the class to evaluate this reasoning. Nicki then remarked: “What I’m confused about is why we have 5 seconds here and another 5 seconds here separately [pointing at Casey’s representation], since we continue from 1 to 12 [strokes]?” In responding to Nicki’s confusion, Bud clarified the difference in the reasoning of the students supporting the two positions: “What is confusing is that they [Rashaad, Sara, and Casey] count the time between the first 6 strokes and then the time between the last 6 strokes but not the second in between [dividing a single line segment into 11 equal parts]” (see fig. 2c). After further clarification, the group concluded that it should take the clock 11 seconds to make 12 strokes. The teacher asked them to consider whether it would matter to the final result whether the time count starts with the first stroke or after it, and they agreed that in either case it would take 11 seconds. ",64,mtms2012-09-86a,,
"During the discussion, the teacher  carefully led her students to explore each assumption and the consequences of each interpretation. They  did not discuss whether the time for the stroke itself should be deemed negligible or not; if the latter, how would it affect the interpretation of the situation? They finished their deliberation with a keen sense of the extent to which assumptions may be buried so deep in the statement of a problem that they are not immediately visible. They also realized that those assumptions make a distinct difference to the solution. ",65,mtms2012-09-86a,,
IN CLOSING,66,mtms2012-09-86a,,
"By the end of the yearlong investigation, students were more readily able to identify and critically evaluate assumptions when working with word problems. They also became more aware that math is a sense-making process; that mathematical problems are matters of interpretation and require careful examination of given data; and that any inferences made are based on implicit or explicit assumptions that call for examination.",67,mtms2012-09-86a,,
"The preparation of such a project requires an appropriate selection of math problems. These problems should be “noisy”—that is, contain enough ambiguity to allow different interpretations and prompt different solutions. One can find such tasks or devise others by removing some information from existing problems and making them ambiguous. For example, for the purpose of the discussion in the previous section, then was removed from the sentence “It climbs 3 feet and then slips back 2 feet” to open space for more interpretations.  ",68,mtms2012-09-86a,,
"This project’s setting requires an environment that welcomes collaborative deliberation, open expression, respect for ideas, and a teacher’s support in articulating ideas—all of which are best achieved in a community of inquiry, in which the teacher helps students identify and articulate assumptions in the interest of making reasoned judgments.

As such, a community of inquiry is a powerful environment for exploring assumptions and acquiring habits of mathematical thinking and problem solving. ",72,mtms2012-09-86a,,
