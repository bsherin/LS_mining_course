An electoral map is a good tool that can be used by students to look for voting patterns in a presidential election (see fi g. 1). Voters in the northeast, Great Lakes, and Pacifi c states tended to favor Obama; voters in the southern and  plains states tended to favor McCain. The demographics of states that aligned with each candidate can generate richer observations and discussions. States with predominately rural populations tended to favor McCain. However, as informative as the electoral map is, without a deeper  fig. 1 The electoral vote map of the United States during the 2008 presidential election would appear to show that the election was a dead heat.

"Throughout the fi nal months of the 2008 presidential election, there was tremendous interest in poll results. Projected percentages of votes for the candidates were continually updated as John McCain and Barack Obama  sought the electoral votes from each of the fi fty states and the District of Columbia (hereafter referred to collectively as “states”). The candidate who received at least 270 electoral votes would claim the presidency.",3,mtms2010-10-162a,,
"As election night progressed, the  electoral map of the United States was painted state by state: red for states claimed by the Republican candidate, John McCain, and blue for states claimed by the Democratic candidate, Barack Obama. By the end of election night, Obama had claimed 365 votes compared with McCain’s 162 votes and was declared president-elect. (Missouri’s close election was called several weeks later, and its 11 electoral votes were awarded to McCain.)",4,mtms2010-10-162a,,
"Both the plethora of polls leading up to the election as well as the analyses of the results offer mathematics teachers opportunities to integrate   Y, density of the electoral Map",5,mtms2010-10-162a,,
"We presented students with the 2008 electoral map in figure 2, showing  the number of electoral votes assigned to each state, and asked this question:   How did Obama win by such a large margin of electoral votes when  the difference in area between red and blue states appears small? ",6,mtms2010-10-162a,,
"Some students observed that some very large western states had only a few electoral votes (for example, Montana, Wyoming, and Utah each have 3 votes), whereas some states that are much smaller in area have a greater number of electoral votes (for example, New Jersey with 15 votes and Massachusetts  with 12 votes). This situation prompted the question: ",7,mtms2010-10-162a,,
How are electoral votes assigned to each state? ,8,mtms2010-10-162a,,

"The 538 electoral college votes are based on these totals: 50 (the number   of members in the Senate), 435 (the number of members of the House of Representatives), and 3 (for the District of Columbia). The number of  U.S. senators is not based on population; each state elects two senators.  Membership in the House of Representatives is based on population.  Each state gets 1 vote per each member in the House. ",10,mtms2010-10-162a,,
"As students looked at the electoral map in figure 2, showing the   number of electoral votes for each state, they observed that many states  have only 3 electoral votes. Their natural inclination led them to notice  which states have the most electoral votes: California and Texas.",11,mtms2010-10-162a,,

"If a casual observer were to mistake the color-designated areas to be indicative of the 2008 winner, he or she could incorrectly conclude that the race to achieve a majority of electoral votes was very close. If Alaska were drawn to scale, McCain would appear overwhelmingly favored. Such an interpretation is based on the erroneous perception that the area of a state is proportional to its vote count in the electoral college. States’ area versus population (their density) would be a good discussion for the middle school mathematics classroom. Students could be asked to consider multiple representations of election results and to make connections using a histogram among mean, median, proportion, and ratio. Figure 2 shows a distribution of electoral college votes.",14,mtms2010-10-162a,,
"To take advantage of the enthu-  siasm surrounding the election, we conducted two activities in the months leading up to the 2008 presidential elections with several groups of middle school and high school students from urban areas of Maryland. Both activities focused on the electoral map and ideas of states’ area versus population:  1.  The first activity used histograms to summarize the distribution of electoral votes. As a representation of data, the histogram removes the visually deceptive layer of states’ geographic area. By coloring sections of the histogram by candidate, students investigated voting trends in this area-neutral setting.  2.  The second activity directly confronted the seeming contradiction that more of one color (more area) does not necessarily imply the winner. Students constructed a cartogram, or pseudo-map, where area was proportional to population.",15,mtms2010-10-162a,,
"The two activities present very different mathematical lenses for viewing the electoral map results. The point is for students to engage in different approaches when communicating mathematical ideas while learning about civics and the demographics of their state and country. It is hoped that teachers try one or both of these cross-curricular activities during this, another election year.  histograMs and the election",16,mtms2010-10-162a,,
"The main mathematical purpose of this activity, with regard to the election process, was for students to gain a deeper understanding about what a histogram can and cannot tell them. Thus, rather than have students spend time constructing a relevant example, we chose to introduce a color-coded histogram that illustrates the distribution of electoral votes across all the states. Presented with the histogram in fi gure 3a (and having put aside the electoral map), we asked students to think about how measures of center might help them summarize the data: ",17,mtms2010-10-162a,,
"On average, how many electoral votes does each state have?",18,mtms2010-10-162a,,
"Students who wanted to add all the states’ electoral votes were confronted with the fact that the histogram, presenting grouped data, conceals individual data values. For those students who did not know how to calculate the mean, we asked them to think about what they need to fi nd the average number of electoral votes per state. Students had previously worked with mean as “fair share” and referred to the idea that you needed to take the total number of electoral votes and divide them by (distribute them evenly among) the number of “states.” In other words, if each state had equal representation in the electoral college so that the 538  fig. 3 The histogram of electoral votes across all 50 states plus the District of Columbia can be used to glean statistical information about the vote distribution among states.",19,mtms2010-10-162a,,

The more skewed the data, the less appropriate is the mean as a typical value. Since the median is the value that separates the lower half of the data from the upper half, it is not affected by skewness (or outliers) and is a better measure of center in notable cases where outliers occur. ",81,mtms2010-10-162a,,
"We asked students to use their understanding of median as well as how a histogram summarizes data to make an educated guess about the median value. Since the histogram contained 51 data values, they figured it to be the 26th ordered value. They determined that this value fell within the first bar on the graph, somewhere between 3 and 8, inclusive. Finally, we gave students an ordered list of  the number of electoral votes per state (see table 1) that allowed them to determine the median to be precisely 8. ",82,mtms2010-10-162a,,
"We then asked students to interpret the meaning of both measures of center: Of all the states, 50 percent have 8 or fewer electoral votes, and 50 percent have at least 8 electoral votes. Connecting this to the histogram, figure 3b uses two colors to illustrate that the median divides the area of the graph in half. Visually, the mean is where the graph balances along the horizontal axis, symbolized with an arrow (see fig. 3b). Comparing the relative positions of the median and mean, we pointed out that more than one-half the states (all the yellow, plus some green) received less than the fair share (mean) number of electoral votes. That is, the mean is greater than  color found predominantly to the right will dominate). ",83,mtms2010-10-162a,,
"This activity offers some instructional options for teachers. Teachers may choose to have students construct the histogram on their own, rather than presenting them with one to interpret. From a demographic viewpoint, the fi nal analysis can be extended when students notice the near-equal area of red and blue states on the electoral college map but see a clear victory in terms of total number of electoral votes for Obama. That is, students may naturally (or be prompted to) wonder what extreme  discrepancies could result between the electoral map and its corresponding histogram of the distribution of electoral votes. ",84,mtms2010-10-162a,,
"Students could be asked to create a colored electoral map that appeared to favor the losing candidate. Students could start by determining the fewest number of states needed to obtain 270 electoral votes to win the election.

Would the minimum number of states needed to win correspond to the minimum  fig. 4 A histogram of electoral votes is color coded by the results of how many votes each candidate captured. Although the particular red and blue pattern of coloring “shared” bars is arbitrary, this approach is meant to simplify the representation by keeping each candidate’s captured states contiguous.  the median, a direct result of the rightskewed shape.",85,mtms2010-10-162a,,
"Next, we gave students another histogram, this time color coded by 2008 election results (see fi g. 4). This is called a stacked histogram; both candidates’ colors are in one graph, and bars are shared. For comparative purposes, we also displayed fi gure 5, which shows two separate side-by-side histograms, one for each candidate. We asked a series of questions that prompted students to interpret the histograms and make observations of voting trends. These questions encouraged students to focus on which candidate tended to win states with a large (defi ned as larger than the mean) number of electoral votes.",86,mtms2010-10-162a,,
"Summarizing the interpretations, students found that Barack Obama not only won more states (29) than John McCain (22) but also was favored in states with a large number of electoral votes, with the exception of Texas. These states, outliers in terms of their number of electoral votes, can have an incredibly large impact on election results. An important point of discussion would be that on both the electoral map and the histogram, areas of colored regions designated to candidates do not correlate with their respective number of electoral votes. On the electoral map, issues of population come into play, whereas on the histogram, location along the horizontal axis is the critical factor (i.e., the  fig. 5 Side-by-side histograms of the 2008 presidential candidates’ separate electoral gains make the win a little clearer.",87,mtms2010-10-162a,,

Just after the 2008 election, our students completed this activity using our state of Maryland, which decidedly favored Obama.

The majority of the U.S. map for the 2008 election was colored red, even though in actuality an electoral landslide favored the blue states. This occurred because the area of each state was by no means directly proportional to its population. What would the map look like if it were? ",93,mtms2010-10-162a,,
"A cartogram is a map in which  regions are drawn by using a scale for area that is proportional to some variable other than land area. Figure 6’s cartogram of the U.S. map is based on population, with states color coded by the 2008 election results. It shows each state redrawn proportional in size to its population so that, for example, Connecticut appears to be nearly 3 1/2 times the size of Montana. Although inevitably the result is a distorted image of the original map, the fun is in trying to maintain relative locations and some semblance of the shape of regions. In addition to the cartogram in fi gure 6, interested readers can view other election cartograms, including ones based on electoral votes (very similar to, but not the same as, those based on population) at http://www-personal.umich.",94,mtms2010-10-162a,,

"Many were able to articulate that the map does not reflect population. Students were then given a reference map of Maryland broken into eight regions, some of those being single counties especially meaningful to the students and some being several contiguous counties that are often grouped together regionally, such as western Maryland. We gave them a data sheet that included the actual populations of each county and led a discussion focusing on how much of Maryland’s population lives in the different regions.",97,mtms2010-10-162a,,
"We clarified that since we wanted  to compare regions based on their populations, we wanted to talk about relative population rather than absolute numbers. A few immediately understood and used fractional language (for example: “The central part of the state has more than 1/3 of the entire  population!”). This eventually led to a discussion about the usefulness of expressing each region’s population as a percentage of the entire state’s population. Students pored over the data and were encouraged to give estimates:  “More than 10 percent of Marylanders live in Baltimore City.” Population (actual and estimated) data for any state can be found at the Census Bureau site at www.census.gov.",98,mtms2010-10-162a,,

"To ensure that the result was accurate, students were reminded that they must use the exact number of square units assigned for each region but could use them in chunks or slice and dice as much as they wanted. When they glued their squares together, they should have no gaps or overlaps, since the entire percentage—no more and no less—must be in view to represent the correct relative population. To distinguish one region from another, students darkened the outline of each region as it was completed.",105,mtms2010-10-162a,,
"Students approached the creative aspect of this activity with differing levels of precision and artistic license. The results therefore ranged from maps whose regions had been meticulously pieced together to mimic regional shapes to others that more abstractly represented Maryland’s general shape.   Ultimately, our goal was not only to create a cartogram for the population of Maryland but also to overlay the variable of political-party rule (by majority vote)—Democratic (blue) or Republican (red)—for each region. An obvious approach is to have students color the regions, similar to local media, as a final step. However, in the interest of time, our students had been given grid paper that was already printed blue or red. They had been instructed to pay attention to the color with which they should be working, depending on the 2008 majority vote of each region; a blue-and-red election map of Maryland by county was displayed at the front of the room to help them.  Thus, as they pieced their regions together, they could see how the cartogram map of Maryland compared with the original blue-andred county-by-county election map of accurate scale, and it became obvious why Obama won Maryland. ",106,mtms2010-10-162a,,
"The coloring approach described above mimics the “winner takes all” display for coloring states in the U.S. electoral map: The color of the county (or region) merely reflects which candidate won the majority of votes there. However, at the state level, county majorities are irrelevant to the election process—all votes in a state count equally to determine a majority. A more accurate way to color the map is to assign red or blue within each region in proportion to the actual  number of votes cast per candidate. ",107,mtms2010-10-162a,,
"The second color-coding option in the instructions refers to further subdividing regions by their proportions of red-and-blue votes.

Further, teachers can adjust the extensiveness of the calculations their students need to perform (and thereby move among various forms of rational numbers) by giving students the population and voting data in either raw (count), relative frequency, or percent form.

"These activities were presented in  the spirit of integrating an intriguing and timely example of civics with  mathematical representations. The media’s choice of the electoral map as a representation of election results is visually appealing, although fundamentally flawed, or at best potentially misleading, because a state’s dedicated number of electoral votes is not proportional to its area as displayed by the map. ",111,mtms2010-10-162a,,
"Our two activities countered this  flawed reasoning by taking geographic area out of the picture entirely. With the “winner takes all” method of distributing states’ electoral votes, states with large populations—far to the right side on the histogram and very large on the cartogram—have great influence on the outcome of the election. Until population demographics and, subsequently, the distribution of electoral college votes change, the histogram and U.S. cartogram will remain the same. Each election will  simply color them differently. ",112,mtms2010-10-162a,,
"In the case of the 2008 election,   a simple count found that Obama won more states (29) than McCain (22). However, overlaying the party (color) variable allowed us to see that all but one of these influential states went to Obama, resulting in a very decisive victory (67 percent of electoral votes). At the conclusion of each activity, students had not only expanded and applied their understanding of mathematical concepts (histograms and measures of center or proportion and percentage) but also gained a better appreciation for population distribution within both our state and country and its effect on our voting process.",113,mtms2010-10-162a,,
