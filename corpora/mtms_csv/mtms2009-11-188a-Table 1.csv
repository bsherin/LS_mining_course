How Students  Interpret Graphs hHow do your students perform when  you ask them to interpret graphs that are set in a real-life context? Do they interpret a graph as a literal picture (an iconic interpretation) of a situation? Or do they use a symbolic interpretation?,2,mtms2009-11-188a,,
The skill of interpreting graphs is important. Students will use this skill in many school subjects and settings and in real life. The Algebra ,3,mtms2009-11-188a,,
"Standard for grades 6−8 states that middle school students should be able to “explore relationships between symbolic expressions and graphs of lines, paying particular attention to the meaning of intercept and slope” (NCTM 2000, p.  222) and to “use graphs to analyze the nature of changes in quantities in linear relationships” (p. 222). One of the most frequently cited student errors when interpreting and constructing a graph is the use of an iconic interpretation (Leinhardt, Zaslavsky, and Stein 1990), in other words, interpreting a graph as being a literal picture of a situation without symbolic understanding. A symbolic interpretation of a graph means under-",4,mtms2009-11-188a,,

Raising a Flag,8,mtms2009-11-188a,,
"In the Raising a Flag task (shown in fig. 1), students are asked to choose a graph that represents the height of a flag above the ground as the flag is raised. Two of four graphs in the task can represent the situation. If the flag movement steadily increases over time, then graph A is the correct answer. If pauses occur during the flag-raising process, then graph C is the correct answer. Before presenting the problem, predict what your students will do. When they have completed the task, use the information about what graphs your students chose to assess their mathematical understanding.",9,mtms2009-11-188a,,

This task was completed by 78 undergraduate students in a middle school teacher education program and 170  seventh-grade students. The seventhgrade students’ graph work revealed solution strategies that may be classified in two categories: 1.  An iconic interpretation and 2.  A symbolic interpretation,11,mtms2009-11-188a,,
An Iconic Interpretation of the Graphs,12,mtms2009-11-188a,,
"Most of the seventh graders (91%) made iconic rather than symbolic interpretations of the graphs: The graph they selected represented or reminded them of the context of the question. Two trends of thought appeared. The students made iconic interpretations of either the flag or the pole, for example, “I chose D because the flag on the pole is parallel to the ground.” This student viewed the graph as a literal picture of the flag’s location. ",13,mtms2009-11-188a,,
"In some cases, the interpretation  is iconic because the student described the graph as a literal picture of what the pole looks like: “I chose this graph because flagpoleEgo up straight and so does graph B. Flags do not go up sideways (like D) or slanted and bumpy (like C) or diagonal (like A)” and “because it looks like a normal flagpole.” These latter interpretations reveal a misconception that one could raise a flag with no passage of time. ",14,mtms2009-11-188a,,
"Others also gave reasons that  revealed a lack of understanding of the time variables involved in the task. Bryan chose answer B and explained, “Because when the flag is raised, there is only going to be one variable, height above the ground, and the flag is going to be going up.” Julia said, “I say B because the flag starts at the bottom and rises straight up. Exactly like graph B.” The familiar, concrete situation of raising a flag made it difficult for students to reason abstractly and operate at a symbolic level. Nevertheless, some of the adults had similar problems, with just over half choosing iconic interpretations. One chose B ",15,mtms2009-11-188a,,

A Symbolic Interpretation  of the Graphs,20,mtms2009-11-188a,,
"Some individuals were able to examine the graphs abstractly, that is, at a level that took into account—but went beyond—the physical action of raising a flag. This strategy was more common among the adults, chosen by 49 percent compared with only 9 percent of the middle school students.",21,mtms2009-11-188a,,
"Some seventh graders were aware  that two variables were involved in raising the flag, the time and the height of the flag. Examples included these:  •	 “I	chose	this	[graph	A]	because	 time was on the bottom and height was on the side; it would rise up as time went on.”  •	 “Because	the	height	of	the	flag	 changes as well as the time.”  •	 “I	chose	this	graph	[A]	because	it	 shows the height of the flag over  the period of time that it takes the boy to raise it.” ",22,mtms2009-11-188a,,
"Other students recognized not only time passage and the height of the flag but also the rate of change, or the speed. One student said, “I chose this graph	[A]	because	it	isn’t	going	to	just	 instantly appear at the top; it’s going to gradually get there, and this correctly represents that.” Another said, “Because on A the boy begins raising the flag above the ground already and the height of the flag should gradually increase as he pulls the rope to raise it.”",23,mtms2009-11-188a,,
"The adults showed more advanced thinking. They were able to articulate the abstract relationship between time and the height of the flag, which indicated that they had reached the abstract understanding of the flagraising context. They identified the functional relationship in the case of raising the flag. Some described a linear relationship:  •	 “I	chose	A	because	it	increases	 steadily as a flag does when it is being raised.”  •	 “The	flag	would	be	going	on	a	 linear slope because it is steadily rising.”  •	 “Because	he	is	raising	the	flag	at	a	 steady rate and a graph is a linear line meaning that the line is increasing at the same rate the whole time.”",24,mtms2009-11-188a,,
"Some adults realized that the flag-raising situation can also be represented by graph C, indicating that they were able to recognize potential for steady rising (slanted line) as well as intermittent pauses represented by a constant (horizontal line where the flag height remained the same as time elapsed). One who chose C said, “The ‘stair stops’ represent the flag being raised while the ‘flat line’ represents a break when the boy repositions his hands and the flag doesn’t move.” Her labeling of these components appear in figure 2.",25,mtms2009-11-188a,,

"Both middle school students and  adults encountered difficulty understanding the real-life situation portrayed in this task at a symbolic level. Teachers need to be aware that students’ familiarity with real-life situations sometimes makes it difficult for them to think about these situations abstractly and thus represent their knowledge symbolically. Teachers can urge students to disregard the pictorial resemblance to a situation, reason through the situation and associated graph conceptually, and translate this thinking to appropriate symbolism. Teachers can also ask students to compare different graphs and discuss their similarities and differences. ",30,mtms2009-11-188a,,
"Other worthwhile instructional techniques include having students match descriptions of real-life situations to their unlabeled graphic representations and have students create their own real-life stories to fit provided, unlabeled graphs.",31,mtms2009-11-188a,,
