"One lesson we learned early on in child psychology courses is that learning progresses from the concrete to the semiconcrete, or representational, and fi nally to the abstract or symbolic level. At fi rst glance, this seems to be not only logical but also a given fact of life. This vision of learning is a linear progression. When applied to mathematics, this learning theory leads to the assumption that the use of manipulatives and hands-on learning experiences should precede procedural symbol manipulation. It also leads to the belief that using manipulatives can ensure understanding of more abstract representations. ",10,mtms2010-11-196a,,
"During professional development activities for teachers or in methods classes for teacher candidates, this theory is reinforced when adults work through instructional activities using manipulatives. This statement is often expressed: “If only I had learned mathematics like this, I would have mathematics like this, I would have understood the concepts better.” understood the concepts better.” But are manipulatives a panaBut are manipulatives a panacea for making mathematical cea for making mathematical concepts understandable? If so, concepts understandable? If so, is this tool’s place limited to introis this tool’s place limited to introductory activities?",11,mtms2010-11-196a,,
"Before I go on, I want to be very clear: I am a long-time advocate for using manipulatives in math class. One need only look at my shelves, fi lled with commercial and homemade manipulatives, to see the validation of my commitment. My growing interest is not the manipulatives themselves, but how they can be used most effectively in teaching and learning mathematics. ",12,mtms2010-11-196a,,

"I fi rst questioned the innate powers of manipulatives years ago when I began to use base-ten materials with second graders to develop their concepts of addition and subtraction. I had been introduced to the materials during a professional development activity. It seemed only reasonable that activities using these materials would help my students understand addition and subtraction, especially when regrouping or renaming was involved. Students were clearly more engaged using manipulatives as compared with working through computational exercises with paper and pencil. ",14,mtms2010-11-196a,,

"While using the materials in class, ",16,mtms2010-11-196a,,
"I found that students became adept at playing trading games and representing numbers with the materials but that the activities did not automatically translate to computational proficiency. Early on, I realized that— •	 explicit	connections	needed	to	be	 made among the materials and models and the symbols, and •	 using	manipulatives	was	not	a	substitute for systematically practicing skills over time. ",17,mtms2010-11-196a,,
"Years later, while guiding an activity  that reintroduced my teacher candidates to the Pythagorean theorem, I became even more convinced that the interaction between procedural knowledge and conceptual knowledge and between concrete and abstract experiences was more of an ebb and flow, rather than a linear progression. In the Pythagorean theorem activity, I ask my students to “rediscover” a familiar mathematics procedure using manipulatives. ",18,mtms2010-11-196a,,
"I started by using a scaffolding  activity; students jotted down everything that they could remember about right triangles. Most students included a 2 + b 2 = c 2 on their list. Next, I gave each student colored centimeter cubes and a cardboard triangle with legs of 3 cm and 4 cm and a hypotenuse of 5 cm. I asked them to build a square on each leg of the triangle with centimeter cubes, using a different color on each leg (see fig. 1a). I then challenged them to rearrange these centimeter cubes to form a square on the hypotenuse of their triangle (see fig. 1b). ",19,mtms2010-11-196a,,
"For most of my students this was  an “aha!” moment; they were able to see that the areas of the squares formed on the legs of the triangle equaled the area of the square formed on the hypotenuse of the triangle. For many, it was also the first time they made the connection between the area ",20,mtms2010-11-196a,,

"After using the Pythagorean  theorem for years, they were suddenly seeing the concept in a new light. But would it have had the same impact if I had used this activity to introduce the theorem? I suspect not. ",22,mtms2010-11-196a,,
"I know that my impression of the power of the base-ten materials was impacted by my prior knowledge. As a teacher, one challenge is recalling what it was like not to know a concept, which is even more challenging as we try to look back into our learning experiences. Who can remember when they could not solve a subtraction problem involving regrouping? Yet this is a particularly troublesome concept for young children. ",23,mtms2010-11-196a,,
"I do know that although my students thought that they knew the Pythagorean theorem, most had never thought of it in terms of an area relationship but rather as a method for determining linear measures using a right triangle. I also know that my students make the same errors that middle school and high school students are prone to make when using the theorem. In particular, they do not pay careful attention to the translation back and forth between linear and square measures; thus, they make common errors, such as a + b = c.",24,mtms2010-11-196a,,

"Another important idea when considering the learning progression is the immediate success that students experience when they execute a procedure, even if they do not understand the deeper conceptual underpinnings. Success can be a powerful motivational tool, leading learners to search for a deeper understanding or why a procedure works. And thus, the ebb and flow begins, as does the knowledge that a dynamic relationship exists between conceptual and procedural knowledge.",26,mtms2010-11-196a,,
"It is easy to believe that concrete  experiences must come before abstract or rote symbol manipulation when, as an adult, both procedural knowledge and conceptual knowledge have become one over time. A classic example of the dynamics between procedural knowledge and conceptual knowledge occurs when young children learn to count by reciting a sequence of numbers in order. This procedure is appropriately referred to as rote counting. It does not, however, imply that a child has developed the concept of   one-to-one correspondence that is necessary to count ten objects. In this case, procedural rote counting is a prerequisite to counting a set of objects.",27,mtms2010-11-196a,,
"As I introduce or reintroduce concepts to teacher candidates using  manipulatives, my objective is to build on their existing procedural knowledge and strive for deeper understanding. The manipulatives, in this case, serve as a tool to amplify their understanding rather than introduce the concept. Thus, the learning progression continues to ebb and flow with each new iteration, leading to deeper knowledge. I caution my students not to think  that they will have similar results in their classrooms. I am mindful that I must help them understand that the “aha!” moments that they experience are dependent on the prior knowledge they bring to the learning experience. By using the same manipulatives in their classrooms, they cannot expect  the instantaneous and dramatic “aha!” moments that I am able to facilitate. Effective teaching using concrete materials requires careful and deliberate orchestration of learning tasks by the teacher.  iMPlications",28,mtms2010-11-196a,,
I wish to leave you with two important implications: 1.  We need to be mindful that   manipulatives are not a stand-alone tool for understanding. Carefully planned instruction must include explicit transitional activities so that students can maximize the value of manipulatives for teaching and learning mathematics.  2.  An ongoing ebb and flow between procedural and conceptual knowledge means that manipulatives can and should be used at different junction points in the learning continuum from childhood to adulthood. ,29,mtms2010-11-196a,,
