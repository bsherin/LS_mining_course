"This publication complements NCTM’s Principals and Standards for School Mathematics (2000) with an emphasis on high school mathematics, as the title suggests. However, unlike Curriculum Focal Points for Prekindergarten through Grade 8 Mathematics: A Quest for Coherence (2006), which contained  grade-level specific curriculum standards and learning outcomes, this publication is more general. It does not provide specific grade-level learning objectives but rather focuses on the entire high school experience and the holistic outcome for a high school graduate. ",5,mtms2010-05-556a,,
"Unlike previous NCTM Standards  documents that have used vignettes, Focus in High School Mathematics relies on examples as a way to communicate the vision of what reasoning and sense making might look like for students at  the high school level. These examples, similar to lengthy case studies I have read, caused me to reflect on my own practice and the opportunities for learning that I create in my classroom. I believe the power of the examples could have been more pronounced had the visions of “Equity” and “Coherence” been developed fully for me as a reader prior to learning of the curriculum standards.

The chapters are an excellent resource for any teacher because of the number of strategies that are presented.",12,mtms2010-05-556a,,
"Each chapter has clear labels for grade levels from pre-K−8 for easy access. The content within each chapter presents several problems formed around a “Big Idea,” which describe multiple options, variations, and teaching tips. Options are given in the form of student prompts, which are discussed at length for the teacher. These options include points of emphasis as well as questions that need to be asked of, or addressed with, students. ",13,mtms2010-05-556a,,

Growing pressure to increase student mathematics achievement has caused some schools to create leadership  positions in mathematics. These math leaders are responsible for reforming instruction to increase student achievement without necessarily having any idea how. This book provides math leaders with a road map and some concrete suggestions for how change can be accomplished and sustained.,19,mtms2010-05-556a,,
"The focus of the book is on making curricular change a positive experience for all involved. The authors provide a well-defined plan of reform that emphasizes teacher involvement, creating an environment that is supportive to change, and data-driven decision making. The chapters that describe professional learning communities and how to provide quality professional development are particularly good. Although the book is intended specifically for math leaders, many of the strategies and suggestions could certainly be applied in other disciplines. The one drawback is that a few of the claims of the authors are not supported. For instance, the authors seem to advocate “spiraling” (p. 42), which recent TIMSS research has decried as a negative aspect of a typical U.S. mathematics curriculum. In a later chapter, the authors claim that “mathematics programs in other cultures often dwell on getting correct answers at the expense of fully understanding the mathematics involved” (p. 77) without providing a source for this conclusion. ",20,mtms2010-05-556a,,

"Hyde’s book begins with research, philosophy, and his six “big ideas” for mathematics instruction. The rest of his book contains problems and ideas in each of the following areas: proportional reasoning, numbers and early algebra, algebraic thinking and modeling, geometry and measurement, and data analysis and probability. Additionally, Hyde includes a problem index and a nice section on “planning considerations” for implementation. All problems give great examples of student dialogue and discourse, questioning techniques, implementation ideas, and differentiated instruction ideas.",28,mtms2010-05-556a,,
"Generally, finding quality, rel- evant, mathematically rich problems is difficult, but you will find many of them in this book. For example, the Chocolate Algebra Problem gives an exploratory, concrete way to introduce systems of equations. The humor in the problems and explanations invite you and your students to enjoy the process. The depth of the mathematics in Hyde’s book will challenge students and occasionally even the teacher.

Both Di and Tom think about the numbers and determine that it is referring to a 3-4-5 right triangle. The major weakness in the book is that when Di and Tom problem solve, gigantic leaps occur between the clues and how they solve the mathematical problem. For example, when discussing a slope of −4, Di and Tom conclude that they could use a compass and that it would form a 14-degree angle. To understand how the compass would determine slope, knowledge of right-triangle trigonometry is necessary. ",42,mtms2010-05-556a,,
"The book is mathematically accurate. However, if it is read in an algebra class, the teacher would need to supplement it with handouts and background knowledge to cover some of the mathematics.

Each transparency uses rotating dials to create multiple problems with parallel structure and subtle variations. For example, one transparency displays a fuel gauge and the size of a gas tank. Students are challenged to determine how many gallons would be needed to fill the gas tank from the information they are given. The teacher can manipulate the transparency to change the size of the tank and the fuel-gauge indicator to create additional practice or extension problems. ",44,mtms2010-05-556a,,

"Appearances can be deceiving. When I first looked at Open the Number by  Nicola Onorati, I was unimpressed. The bland blue box with the title printed in low-resolution lettering made the game look outdated and boring. If I saw the box on the shelf at a store, even an educational learning supply store, I would not pick it up. When I opened the box to examine its contents, my tepid reaction did not improve. As I read the instructions, I was baffled. Again and again, word choice was awkward, and sentences were hard to understand. I wondered if perhaps it was a poor translation from another language. There was strange and mysterious mention of “the author,” and some sentences were written in regular text, whereas others, seemingly at random, were written in italics.
