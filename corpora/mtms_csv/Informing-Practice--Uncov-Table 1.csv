3,Informing Practice: Uncovering and Eliciting Perceptions in Linguistically Diverse Classrooms,One of the many challenges that teachers face in mathematics classrooms is determining how much of the verbal and written explanations help students accomplish instructional goals. The challenge is greater in  linguistically diverse classrooms because the explanations and multiple representations are not perceived uniformly by all students. ,3,Informing Practice: Uncovering and Eliciting Perceptions in Linguistically Diverse Classrooms
4,Informing Practice: Uncovering and Eliciting Perceptions in Linguistically Diverse Classrooms,"Recent research on the impact of gestures (Fernandes and McLeman 2012) supplies evidence that students whose primary language is different from the language of instruction  benefit from supporting oral and written explanations with the use of gestures that model mathematical objects and/or processes. Further, these students also benefit from engaging in mathematical discourse using more than one language (Moschkovich 2002). But how do the techniques of gesturing and using more than one language help uncover and elicit students’ mathematical perceptions in a diverse language classroom?",4,Informing Practice: Uncovering and Eliciting Perceptions in Linguistically Diverse Classrooms
5,Informing Practice: Uncovering and Eliciting Perceptions in Linguistically Diverse Classrooms,Let us visit two classrooms that reveal some effective teaching practices for linguistically diverse populations of students. The first classroom illustrates how using gestures and making well-founded pedagogical choices can help in correcting students’ misconceptions concerning the attributes of an object.

31,Informing Practice: Uncovering and Eliciting Perceptions in Linguistically Diverse Classrooms,"After reflecting on this student’s misconception, Mrs. Guardiola realizes that a sizeable number of her students had been noticing her gestures as she had counted the number of edges for the triangular prism but had misinterpreted the meaning of the word edge.",31,Informing Practice: Uncovering and Eliciting Perceptions in Linguistically Diverse Classrooms
32,Informing Practice: Uncovering and Eliciting Perceptions in Linguistically Diverse Classrooms,"CONFRONTING AND AVOIDING MISCONCEPTIONS In the vignette above, the misconception of counting the edges of an object as the number of “segments” in the two-dimensional drawing was more evident in students who were learning English as a second language. One reason could be that the word edge does not sound or look like its Spanish translation: arista in the geometry context or borde in the general context. Mrs. Guardiola was able to uncover these misconceptions by asking her students to justify their answers. However, she then wondered what to do to avoid this misconception in future lessons. One way to avoid misconceptions  is to carefully ensure that the mathematical objects under investigation and their properties guide the selection of representations. In this case, one could redesign the foldable that was central to the lesson so that the mathematical properties of the geometric solids  guided the graphic organization of the concepts. For example, by using the broader categories of pyramids, prisms, and curved-surface objects, students will be better able to understand that the terms base, face, and edge have slightly different meanings and representations according to the category. The table can also be redesigned so that only words that apply to each category appear. For example, although prisms and cylinders have “pairs” of bases, pyramids have no such “pair.” Furthermore, cones and  cylinders do not have line segment edges as do polygonal prisms and pyramids. Another way to avoid misconceptions concerning geometric solids is to differentiate between their threedimensional characteristics and their two-dimensional representations.",32,Informing Practice: Uncovering and Eliciting Perceptions in Linguistically Diverse Classrooms

This can be enacted by all teachers independently of their own language background. The vignette above may look like an example of  simple translation, but it is in fact a pedagogical technique that some researchers refer to as translanguaging.

51,Informing Practice: Uncovering and Eliciting Perceptions in Linguistically Diverse Classrooms,"Soliciting students who have a high  level of proficiency in two or more languages to interpret what is said in one language can greatly benefit all students and, in particular, those developing the language of instruction. This is illustrated in the previous vignette. On one hand, the student translating from Spanish to English is deepening her understanding of the mathematical concept by interpreting what was said and expressing it in her own words. When Sara interpreted Arturo’s example, she used her decontextualizing skills, which in turn was an important  part of reasoning abstractly and quantitatively. On the other hand, Arturo was able to use his preferred language to explain his reasoning of a task given in English, the language in which he is developing proficiency. In this episode, translanguaging serves as a catalyst for expressing a verbal mathematical representation of a mathematical concept with students of different levels of English proficiency.",51,Informing Practice: Uncovering and Eliciting Perceptions in Linguistically Diverse Classrooms

For each category, introduce the set of words that are associated with the geometrical objects. For curved-surface objects, only the words base and vertex are appropriate. This gives an opportunity for students to learn the meanings of the words base, face, edge, and vertex in the context of the objects’ own attributes.
