"Can you tell just by looking if two figures are mathematically similar, or not? Consider the two U-shapes in figure 1. Maybe you notice that the valley of the smaller figure is a rectangle but see it is a square in the larger figure. Maybe you notice that the uprights of the smaller figure have roughly the same width as the base, but that this comparison is not true of the larger figure. ",6,mtms2012-08-30a,,
"When we projected the figures in front of seventh-grade classes, 78 percent of the students, including one named Tom, correctly identified them as not similar. We wanted to find out how students knew that the figures were not similar and how they were using visual reasoning. We saw many students use strategies similar to those mentioned here, but we also ",7,mtms2012-08-30a,,
Visual Intuition unearthed another story about how classroom instruction on similarity may inhibit and may even subvert visual reasoning. ,8,mtms2012-08-30a,,
"Weeks later, after a unit on similar  figures, Tom was asked to solve the same problem on paper. To decide if the two pictured figures were similar, Tom used a strategy that his teacher had taught. He measured three pairs of corresponding sides from figure 1 and constructed a ratio for each pair. According to his measurements, he found that the figure on the right was two times as wide, two times as tall, and had uprights two times as wide. Satisfied, Tom contradicted his original answer and replied that the two shapes were, in fact, similar.",9,mtms2012-08-30a,,
"We do not think that Tom’s  dilemma is unique. In fact, we think  that his reasoning on this task represents difficulties that most students face when studying proportion, specifically, similarity. Lobato and Ellis (2010) point out the challenge of studying and teaching similarity. The change in size from a smaller shape to a larger similar shape (or vice versa) is created through continuous proportional stretching or shrinking in every direction. Students cannot solve similarity tasks simply by iterating or partitioning a composed unit, strategies typically used on numerical proportional tasks. ",10,mtms2012-08-30a,,
"The transition to thinking proportionally is difficult for students and tremendously challenging for teachers to get across to students. After working with urban middle school students, we concluded that understanding similarity was difficult, in part, because oppor tunities to study proportional reasoning were missing from the mathematics curriculum. These opportunities involved studying the following:  1.  Simple and complex figures 2.  Distortion and proportion 3.  Visual reasoning and more   analytical strategies",11,mtms2012-08-30a,,
"Throughout this article, we will use examples of student work and reasoning to illustrate our thinking about these attributes and highlight opportunities to help your students capitalize on what they already know as they transition to thinking numerically about similar figures. We will then describe in depth two different ",12,mtms2012-08-30a,,
"Fig. 1 Given these two U-shaped figures, students were asked to visually determine if they were similar.",13,mtms2012-08-30a,,
"Fig. 2 Although proportional thinking was required for these tasks, students were likely to incorrectly use an additive strategy.",14,mtms2012-08-30a,,
"Fig. 3 Using additive reasoning on the tasks in figure 2 resulted in the following figures. In the case of (b), the student was unable to complete the shape.",15,mtms2012-08-30a,,
The rectangle below is 6 units tall and 4 units wide. Construct another rectangle that is similar to the original but is 6 units wide. ,16,mtms2012-08-30a,,

"angles than sides when proving similarity because congruent corresponding angles will guarantee similarity. With regular polygons, one need only ensure that the two shapes have the same numbers of sides or angles to establish similarity. Limiting the 夽 variety of figures in the curricula to rectangles, triangles, and regular polygons also limits the opportunities that students have to study continuous all-directional proportional growth. ",18,mtms2012-08-30a,,
"Consider how a student might  (a) (b) complete the tasks in figure 2 that require generating a figure similar to a given shape. We found that it was common for middle school students to incorrectly apply additive reasoning, for example, adding 2 cm to all sides, to get another rectangle 6 units tall and 8 units wide. Some constructed the red rectangle in figure 3a without much concern. ",19,mtms2012-08-30a,,
"However, when applying the same  strategy to each side of the L shape, many were notably perturbed for two reasons. First, following the rule (see fig. 3b) meant that the last side could not be constructed. Second, the resulting L shape did not resemble the original. The vertical component was not the same width as the foot, thus  types of classroom activities where these opportunities can arise for students: categorization and construction. Finally, we will provide some specific recommendations about incorporating activities, thereby giving students opportunities to learn about similarity.",20,mtms2012-08-30a,,
thRee KeY oPPoRtUnities 1. Work with Both Simple  and Complex Figures,21,mtms2012-08-30a,,
"First let us explain what we mean by the term complex figures. In this article, it refers to geometric shapes that are not triangles, rectangles, or regular polygons. Readers may notice that this definition essentially excludes all shapes that are commonly used by the textbook when discussing scale drawing or similarity. We are not arguing that these shapes should be excluded from the middle school curriculum entirely. However, working only with simple shapes does not give students sufficient experience with the all-directional proportional changes that are required for scaling figures accurately. ",22,mtms2012-08-30a,,
"Regarding figure 1, for example, finding three pairs of corresponding measures that are of the same proportion cannot guarantee that those two U shapes are indeed similar to each other. In the case of right triangles and rectangles, only two pairs of length measurements are needed to determine if two shapes are similar. With nonright triangles, it makes more sense to compare corresponding  creating distortion. Such distortion provided an opportunity for students and teachers alike to challenge and refute additive reasoning and propose the need to consider alternatives.  2. Study Distortion as Well  as Proportion",23,mtms2012-08-30a,,
"The four pairs of shapes in figure 4 will be called Framed Figure tasks. These figures draw student attention to changes that can occur within a shape when it is being scaled. Using only visual reasoning, can you tell which pairs in figure 4 are similar  and which are not? How can you justify your responses without making measurements?",24,mtms2012-08-30a,,
"If you are like most of our students,  you probably were able to tell just by using visual reasoning that pairs A and B are similar but that pairs C and D are not. Although some students could not explain their answer, most students provided justification on the basis of facets of the figures (general  appearance, angles, lengths) or relation ships between the stars and the parallelograms. Elijah, Chris, and Matt had three different perceptions of those relationships in pair D. The following exchange illustrates these different perspectives on why the shapes are not similar:",25,mtms2012-08-30a,,
"Elijah: The person. They are the same  size. Even though the parallelograms get bigger, the person stays the same.",26,mtms2012-08-30a,,
Chris: Different. The picture would  have to be all the way up there [Chris gestures toward the top of the parallelogram] just like that one. ,27,mtms2012-08-30a,,
"Matt: The girl is the same size as  the other one. If the whole shape changed, if it went from here to here, then the girl would get smaller. [The girl in the larger figure] only comes up halfway and [the girl in the smaller figure] comes up all the way.",28,mtms2012-08-30a,,
We have found  classroom value in  talking about  resizing  photographs or changing a font’s size.,29,mtms2012-08-30a,,
"Elijah first identified the relationship between the two girls and used it as a standard by which to compare it with the relationship between the parallelogram frames. Chris used the relationship between the height of the girl and her parallelogram frame in the smaller image to compare with the same relationship in the larger. Matt used both ways to describe why the figures in pair D are not similar. In all three cases, students used qualitative reasoning that was not  based on specific measurements.",30,mtms2012-08-30a,,
"They perceived a distortion and  described it in visual terms. However, even though they were describing distortion, their expectations about what the shape should look like reflected an informal understanding of proportion. Furthermore, the evidence they provided was based on a relationship between two components of the shape. Thinking about relative positions rather than absolute differences is a major transition that middle school students make when learning to reason proportionally (Lobato and Ellis 2010).",31,mtms2012-08-30a,,
"On all the items shown in figure 4 (and more), our students’ justifications of why two shapes were nonsimilar were far more reasoned and specific than justifications of why two shapes were similar. When they perceived that two shapes were similar, they simply had nothing to comment on—everything looked great. Matt, the same student who used both types of relationships on pair D, responded with much less evidence when explaining why pair A was similar:",32,mtms2012-08-30a,,
"That one looks the same as the last one I think, except for the star. The star didn’t change. Shape too. [The star] just gets smaller.",33,mtms2012-08-30a,,

"By using tasks that feature distorted pairings, students may be more likely to point to specific evidence and reasoning in classroom discussions. This will open up many more opportunities for students such as Matt to find words to talk about the relationships #3 they perceive, and help teachers make strategies for numerical analysis more explicit for all students.  #5 #4 3. Incorporating Visual Reasoning into Analytic Strategies",45,mtms2012-08-30a,,
"Reconsider the U shapes in figure 1. Tom showed us that it was possible to compare multiple pairs of corresponding lengths, correctly found that a constant ratio existed in all the pairings, and still concluded falsely that the shapes were similar. He stopped after three comparisons. In our work, we found it was difficult for most students to know when they had made sufficient comparisons to conclude similarity.",46,mtms2012-08-30a,,
"Although the definition of similarity specifies that all pairs of corresponding segments should be compared, we did not find this to be a common expectation. For example, in the problem in figure 5, it would seem out of place to label all four pairs of corresponding sides. In class, students are rarely expected to address all four pairs in their response. They could use  visual cues or even geometric properties to reason that opposite sides are congruent and thus conclude that the other two corresponding sides do not need to be compared. However, we have observed that this reasoning is rarely made explicit, either in writing or in a verbal explanation. We are confident that the sample response given below would be acceptable in most circumstances as evidence of correct proportional reasoning. ",47,mtms2012-08-30a,,
"Most of our students, like Tom, seemed to have learned implicit lessons about necessary and sufficient conditions for similarity from their work with simple polygons, such as “it is only necessary to measure some sides” or “you should compare those sides that are labeled.” These lessons did not translate well to the figures being compared. Our students either lacked a systematic way of knowing when enough was enough, or they used inappropriate strategies that had been sufficient in prior math classes.",48,mtms2012-08-30a,,
"Taking a purely analytical approach to categorization tasks can be limiting, especially when the task is to prove that two shapes are similar. In the case of U shapes, after all angles have been established as right angles, one has to check a minimum of four pairs of length measures of  #1 #5 #3 #4 corresponding sides assuming the symmetry, five if the symmetry is not assumed. The reader might want to verify that knowing the five sides of a U shape are enough to prove that the figures are similar. One possible length of those five sides is illustrated in figure 6. ",49,mtms2012-08-30a,,
"This argument does not deny the  importance of analytic reasoning. Visual judgments provide structure for mathematical description, but they are not themselves numerical descriptions. To completely abstract the  act of classifying or scaling figures,  analytical reasoning is required. However, visual judgment can greatly reduce the analytical workload by indicating to a student where to look to find likely counterevidence.",50,mtms2012-08-30a,,
"When using framed figures or U shapes, encouraging students to verbalize what they see can also push them to notice and quantify relationships among side lengths or use properties like symmetry. Had Elijah, Chris, and Matt been given an opportunity to describe to their peers the relationships they noticed, a teacher could have capitalized on such discussions and suggested that specific measurements be made and ratios constructed. Listening to the arguments made by students could also help teachers detect the implicit lessons that students were picking up regarding what is necessary and sufficient when determining if two  shapes are similar. Being thus aware, teachers could be more explicit in their instruction. ",51,mtms2012-08-30a,,

"We have found potential for providing these three key opportunities in two types of activities already found in most textbooks: categorization and construction. In this section, we will describe these two types and provide examples of how you could increase the likelihood that your students will have key opportunities to learn about similarity.",53,mtms2012-08-30a,,
Activity Type 1:  Categorization Tasks,54,mtms2012-08-30a,,
"Categorization tasks, like the one shown in figures 1, 4, and 7, require students to decide whether or not two figures are similar and to provide reasons for their decision. When used throughout a unit on similarity, these tasks begin to help students look for proportion and also to describe the difference between all-directional growth and growth in one dimension. However, they are often introduced at the beginning of a curricular unit and then disappear. Ideally, these tasks would continue to be used throughout the unit and eventually feature more sophisticated distortions, such as those described earlier, to help students develop a deep understanding of similarity and relative thinking. It is also important to draw  students’ attention to the power of holistic reasoning and distortion detection. Rather than replace these tools with traditional analytic algorithms for proving that two shapes are similar, build on proportional intuitions by encouraging the recognition of external and internal relationships as a good structure for comparing two shapes. At that point, students can begin thinking numerically about these relationships with more complex figures.",55,mtms2012-08-30a,,
"Fig. 7 This task helped students think, specifically, about proportion and to consider all-directional growth as well as growth in one dimension. ",56,mtms2012-08-30a,,

"We encourage you to use categorization tasks throughout your unit that feature complex figures to help students refine visual thinking and become experts at distortion detection. Although U shapes and framed figures are easily created using clip art or other drawing software, you can also look to sports logos, nature, and photography for inspiration. Consider how the task in figure 7 could be modified to incorporate more sophisticated distortions. ",58,mtms2012-08-30a,,
Activity Type 2:  Constructing Similar Figures,59,mtms2012-08-30a,,
"There is value in considering how complex figures, grid paper, or dragging technology (such as found in Word programs) can be used. Students may already have experience with constructions that are brought into classroom discussions. For example, we have found it worthwhile to talk about resizing photographs or changing a font’s size. These images become powerful tools in describing how different strategies for construction introduce distortion and for identifying strategies that do not. ",60,mtms2012-08-30a,,
The construction task in figure 8 requires students first to make some conjectures about what this figure would look like when scaled by a factor of two using grid paper. The act of prediction is important because it documents students’ expectations about scale and provides a good site for formative self-assessment. Using technology to drag the triangle and to  #3 #4,61,mtms2012-08-30a,,

How did you do? 3.  How many blocks tall is the bottom gap between the two triangles in the original picture? How many blocks tall is the bottom gap between the two triangles in the scaled picture? students use visual reasoning to question a mathematical relationship they may otherwise take for granted. Give students a chance to talk about what they see, not just what they measure, when solving these tasks.  3.  Find opportunities during classroom activities to incorporate images that are constructed using strategies that do not preserve proportion. Encourage students to spot distortions in these images and to challenge the mathematical reasoning that created them.
