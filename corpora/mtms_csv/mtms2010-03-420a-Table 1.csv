"While working with students, teachers must remind themselves of the unique learning styles, cultural cues, and societal constructs of those who walk into class every day. These twelve essays, written by university professors  and high school math teachers, attest to the idea that educators are charged with recognizing the diversity of the students in our classrooms and with using this recognition as a lens through which to understand and teach. This volume, geared toward the high school population, is an accessible tool for change in the classroom.",15,mtms2010-03-420a,,

Reasoning and evaluating what must be found and the how involved constitutes the lessons provided in this text. The four Es—engage, explore, evaluate, and extend—are in each activity in this book. The lessons cover material that is part of the middle school curriculum. Hands-on activities that enhance the reasoning abilities of the student provide for higher-level thinking skills.",21,mtms2010-03-420a,,
"I found this book to be userfriendly, providing background information and suggestions for the lesson, including lesson handout sheets to be used by the student. The information is there for teachers to use as they wish. The topics are organized so that the activities can easily be incorporated in the classroom. For example, the lesson titled Reasoning about Area Formulas offers good visualization for students and allows them to cut and move shapes to find connections. With In-Venn-stigating Factors and Multiples, students learn to identify the multiples and again find connections. ",22,mtms2010-03-420a,,

"There are more than 200 specific activities linked to NCTM’s Focal Points contained in this wellorganized and very readable book. These activities embody the twenty strategies that Tate considers important research-based ways to deliver effective instruction to promote long-term retention. Some strategies, such as using cooperative learning, will undoubtedly be familiar to most mathematics educators; others, such as the use of guided imagery and the use of movement, will probably be less familiar. ",37,mtms2010-03-420a,,
"These activities are designed to be directly incorporated into the pre-K−8 classroom but are inherently flexible. Many can be easily modified with regard to specific content or grade level. For example, a Kit-Kat bar activity designed to introduce fractions could be easily modified to introduce multiplication with fractions. ",38,mtms2010-03-420a,,
"The book contains more than just activities in support of learning strategies, however. Tate introduces each of the twenty strategy chapters in a personal and thought-provoking way. Each chapter contains a documented set of relevant, though synopsized, research findings. Some danger exists that a few of these sound-bite research findings might be overgeneralized if not read with acumen. ",39,mtms2010-03-420a,,
"Additionally, one or two of the activities themselves are of debatable merit: Is it really sending the right message, for example, to encourage students to memorize a rhyme such as “Yours is not to reason why: just invert and multiply.” ",40,mtms2010-03-420a,,
"Nonetheless, I would highly  recommend this book to educators, and perhaps parents, who want to creatively promote visual, auditory, kinesthetic, and tactile learning.  — Reuel Smith, Indiana University, Bloomington, IN 47405 on-the-Job Math Mysteries:  Real-life Math from exciting careers Marya Washington Tyler, 2009.

"On-the-Job Math Mysteries is an activity book about twenty-four exciting careers, such as a beekeeper, wildlife videographer, diver, and circus performer. A two- to four-page spread describes the career using pictures; provides quotes from a person in the industry; and sets up practical, careerrelated math problems for fourth- to eighth-grade students to solve individually or in small groups. Math topics include place value, geometry, decimals, estimating, and analyzing data. Each career’s activity pages could be photocopied for classroom use as part of a specific math lesson, as a supplemental activity, as an extension, or as a lesson focused on careers.",42,mtms2010-03-420a,,
"For example, the activity about  the soup kitchen operator describes Ken, a volunteer, who is making pancakes. The math activities relate to measurement, conversion, fractions, and percents. His recipe feeds thirty people, and students are asked to change the recipe to feed fortyfive. A second problem involves his helper, Raki, who is cleaning surfaces with bleach and water and needs to know how long a gallon of bleach will last. A third problem uses real-life data and asks students to calculate the percent of people being served in the categories of men, women, girls, and boys. ",43,mtms2010-03-420a,,
"This book would be a valuable  resource for middle-grades teachers who like to have practical, supplemental materials at their fingertips.

"As a middle school mathematics teacher, I was constantly looking for connections to literature that I had seen in the elementary classroom. This book is wonderfully written and illustrated to help engage students in working with fractions and decimals. The cartoons and easy readability not only capture the reader’s attention but also keep one wanting to read more.",46,mtms2010-03-420a,,
My concern is that this type of  book may only deal with algorithms and procedures. This book does not. It does start with some conceptual pieces but continues into the algorithm so  students can quickly see where the procedure comes from. ,47,mtms2010-03-420a,,
"Many connections are made  throughout as the authors discuss fractions and decimals. With my teacher hat on as I read, I could see picking it up and reading to my students a chapter such as “Out of Order” as a hook to introduce them to ordering fractions. It asks the reader to decide what would be easier to compare: the numerator, the denominator, or the whole number? A quick flip of the pages lets the reader validate his or her answer. The authors then discuss how to compare fractions when the numerators are the same. Multiple approaches and learning styles are addressed.",48,mtms2010-03-420a,,

"The introduction contains information and tips from the author on using the book in a classroom. The activities can be used in grades 5–8 or high school geometry, but they could also be used as enrichment for advanced third-grade or fourth-grade  students. The author recommends using the lessons to supplement a geometry textbook, as a two-week unit, or in pull-out sessions for gifted students. ",54,mtms2010-03-420a,,
"The lessons are divided into ten  chapters, covering lines, angles, kites, triangles, quadrilaterals, similar figures, circles, and arithmetic. Each lesson contains guided or open-ended constructions, or both, providing support while encouraging students to explore the constructions on their own. Vocabulary words are emphasized with bold text and definitions. Open-ended questions throughout the lessons encourage students to think critically about the constructions and geometric properties. For example, in one lesson, students are asked to evaluate when the side-sideangle theorem does and does not determine a congruent triangle. As the lessons advance, they tend to build on previous lessons. Less direction is given to the students, creating a challenge with an appropriate level of difficulty. ",55,mtms2010-03-420a,,
"Overall, the lessons are well written, with detailed explanations and diagrams. This engaging, supplementary approach to geometry can give students a greater understanding of geometric figures and their properties.",56,mtms2010-03-420a,,

"Algebra Level E (grade 5). Each task began with a simple, straightforward lesson that should be sufficient when used appropriately for remediation. The greatest strength of the series is the assessment CD. Another strength is the two constructed-response questions in every lesson. However, although writing mathematical explanations is an important skill for students, more challenging extensions to the constructed-response questions would be helpful. In addition, more than six problems per lesson would also improve the series. ",62,mtms2010-03-420a,,
