The problem context about farmers who buy and sell land (see fig. 1) has the potential to engage students in mathematical thinking that supports the process of adding and subtracting fractions symbolically. The questions posed in figure 1 are a selection of those found in the complete published version of the Land problem. These questions require students to work ,3,mtms2013-05-527a,,

"Fraction addition and subtraction is a challenging topic for students. Common	instructional	entry	points	 have included using contextual situations, physical models, and diagrams. However, research cautions that contexts, models, and diagrams in and of themselves do not carry meaning. The representations that students develop can provide a solution to the problem at hand, but they may not necessarily engage students in mathematical reasoning (Smith 2003). Teachers have an important role to play in moving students beyond simply describing pictures or diagrams. The conversations that teachers have with students about working with the ideas embedded in situational contexts, models, and diagrams should be aimed at developing key mathematical ideas about fraction addition and subtraction.  with a context, a diagram, and number sentences. However, the mathematical ideas that emerge depend on what is elicited from students while working with the task. The discussion that occurred in a sixth-grade classroom will highlight the mathematical reasoning that can help support students to make sense of fraction addition and subtraction.

"ReVisiting eQUiValence  as a concePt Question 1 of the Land problem asked students to determine what fraction of a section of land each farmer owned and explain how they knew. Depending on how students partitioned each section, multiple equivalent fractional names can emerge for each farmer. One discussion can focus on asking students to use the map to illustrate what fraction of a section each farmer owns.",6,mtms2013-05-527a,,
"Using farmer Gardella as an ex- ample, a teacher can ask:  •	 How	can	you	use	your	map	to	 show that Gardella owns 3/16? •	 What	does	the	16	in	3/16	mean? •	 Can	you	use	the	map	to	show	that 	 16 equal-size portions are in a section of land?",7,mtms2013-05-527a,,
"These questions prompted students to show how they partitioned each section of land into 16 “Bouck-size” pieces and that Gardella’s land used 3 of the 16ths in a section. Other students partitioned each section of land into 32nds, determining that Gardella  owned 6/32 of land. One student initially broke the map into 16ths and then, as needed for some farmers, broke some sections into 32nds. (See fi g. 2.)",8,mtms2013-05-527a,,
A second discussion can focus on  establishing that multiple fractions ,9,mtms2013-05-527a,,

"When Tupelo Township was founded, the land was divided into sections that could be farmed. Each section is a square that is 1 mile long on each side. In other words, each section is 1 square mile of land. There are 640 acres of land in a square-mile section. The diagram below shows two sections of land that are adjacent, or side by side. Each section is divided among several owners. The diagram shows the part of a section that each person owns.",11,mtms2013-05-527a,,

"can be used to show what portion of a section of land a farmer owns. The teacher recorded, for reference, various equivalent fractions identifi ed by students during discussion (see fi g. 3). Despite the many fractional names for how much land a farmer owned, each fraction name represented equivalent amounts of land. This scenario became visually apparent to students when areas were partitioned into 16ths or 32nds.",20,mtms2013-05-527a,,
"Symbolism can also be used  to show fractional equivalence, as explored by the teacher when asking, “We	have	used	our	map	to	show	that	 both 3/16 and 6/32 are acceptable answers for how much land Gardella owns.	Can	we	decide	if	both	3/16	 and 6/32 are acceptable by using the symbols?” Trevor offered, “I can show that they are equal without the map because if I take 3/16 and multiply the numerator by 2 and multiply the denominator by 2, I get 6/32.” The teacher replied, “So you turned each 16th on the map into two 32nds? So, 3 times 2 is 6.”",21,mtms2013-05-527a,,
"Earlier, when discussing Bouck’s and Krebs’s land, it had been established that a 32nd was one-half the size of a 16th, and that it took twice as many Krebs-units as Bouck-units to cover a portion of land. Trevor’s response suggested that he was connecting what was established visually when partitioning the map with what he knew about fi nding equivalent fractions symbolically. During discussions, it is important for teachers to ask questions that draw out important mathematical ideas embedded in students’ work with contexts, models, and symbolism (Petit, Laird, and Marsden 2010). ",22,mtms2013-05-527a,,
VisUaliZing liKe-siZe PoRtions The remaining questions in the Land problem explored what happened when different owners sold or bought  sections of land. Students were asked to write number sentences to show their solutions. A key discussion goal for these four questions was to have students use symbolism to model situations in which fractions were added and subtracted. ,23,mtms2013-05-527a,,
"During discussion, the teacher asked students to talk about their number sentences and use the map to show how they knew their number sentences were valid. Students’ responses indicated that they were using like-size portions in an intuitive manner. For instance, when discussing question 2 in fi gure 1, in which Fuentes bought Theule’s land, two number sentences were offered:  16 16 16 and 32 32 32",24,mtms2013-05-527a,,
"In each case, students used their map and counted like-size units to compute the totals. However, if operating with symbols is going to be meaningful, students need to consider what meaning their number sentences carry with them.",25,mtms2013-05-527a,,
"One focus of the conversation  involved establishing whether it was possible for both number sentences to	be	valid.	“What	if	you	didn’t	have	 the map? How could you be sure that both are true”? Kaylee offered that both 4/16 and 8/32 were equivalent to 1/4. This led Jared to offer that if you used equivalence, you could rename each fraction in the sentence  16 16 16 as 32 666 32 32 by multiplying each fraction in the fi rst sentence by 2/2. Similar to the earlier discussion with Trevor, the students used equivalence to help make sense of symbols. This is an important mathematical idea that will eventually help students develop an algorithm for adding and subtracting fractions. ",26,mtms2013-05-527a,,

"What	was	not	explicit	in	students’	 discussion of their work was how they were using fractions with common denominators. Number sentences like those above implied that they were adding like-size portions. They were  using common denominators intuitively when fi nding how much land Fuentes owned after buying Theule’s land. This was not a criticism, rather an	observation.	When	students	began	 to use like-size portions in an intuitive ",29,mtms2013-05-527a,,

Question 3 provided an opportunity to push students to consider explicitly how using like-size portions might help to make sense of their symbolic representations. ",35,mtms2013-05-527a,,
"Figure 4 shows two number sentences for question 3 that ask students to fi nd partitions of land that would sum to 1 1/2. Jenna partitioned Lapp, Gardella, and Bouck into 16ths on her map. Her number sentence used like-size portions. In contrast, Martin sectioned part of his map into 16ths and part into 32nds.",36,mtms2013-05-527a,,
"The teacher noted that when looking at Jenna’s solution, it was easy to see from her number sentence that the sum was 1 1/2. The teacher then said, “I am not sure when I look at Martin’s number sentence if it is 1	1/2.	Can	someone	talk	about	that?”	",37,mtms2013-05-527a,,
"Martin used his map and pointed to Gardella, Fuentes, and Fitz, showing that each was on the bottom half of section 18. Because he had partitioned	Stewart	and	Wong	into	 32nds, he noted that the three 32nds for	Wong	would	ﬁ	t	into	the	part	of	",38,mtms2013-05-527a,,
"Stewart that was in the bottom half  of section 18. The teacher replied, “OK, but what if I just wanted to use the symbols to show that the sum	is	1	1/2.	Why	is	that	hard	to	 do?” Because a brief pause ensued, the teacher asked students to discuss this in groups for a minute. One student offered, “Some of the parts are in 16ths and some are in 32nds.” Another student said, “If you had everyone in 32nds, it would be easy to see that there are 16 or half of 32.” ",39,mtms2013-05-527a,,
"When	discussing	question	3,	the	 teacher asked students to consider if particular uses of symbolism more effectively conveyed to others how the sum was determined. Having likesize portions, or common denominators, was helpful when working symbolically. ",40,mtms2013-05-527a,,
"When	an	instructional	goal	is	to	 engage students in algorithm development, Gravemeijer and van Galen (2003) explain that “such a reinvention process starts with carefully chosen contextual problems. To solve these problems, students must model the situations to some degree” (p. 114). The map and the farmer scenario served as such a context. However, Petit, Laird, and Marsden  (2010) point out that teachers also need to build on students’ generated models and strategies by asking probing questions that help them generalize mathematical ideas for operating with fractions.",41,mtms2013-05-527a,,
connecting eQUiValence and liKe-siZe PoRtions,42,mtms2013-05-527a,,
"In previous episodes, students began to use equivalence as a reasoning tool. They were also using common denominators but often in an implicit way. In the preceding episode, students found that using common denominators was helpful when adding fractions symbolically. In this next episode, the teacher purposefully continued this line of discussion.",43,mtms2013-05-527a,,
"Question 4 asked students to provide	number	sentences.	When	 discussing question 4a, two responses were offered: 16 16 16 and 32 32 10 32",44,mtms2013-05-527a,,
"After using the map to determine that both sentences were true, the teacher posed a third number sentence,  32 + =+ = 16 for consideration. The ensuing conversation is shown in fi gure 5. The teacher asked students to look across symbolic solutions and consider if they could all be true. Equivalence then emerged as a tool for helping students interact with symbolism. Renaming fractions, so that they are expressed with common denominators or like-size portions, also emerged as a tool for adding and subtracting simple fractions symbolically. ",45,mtms2013-05-527a,,
"Throughout work with the Land  problem, three key tips evolved to help students engage with the mathematics inherent in representations for adding and subtracting fractions:  1.  Listen carefully to students as  they talk about how they are using contexts, models, and symbols. Are students finding their solutions solely through drawing a diagram or	using	a	model?	Can	they	use	 symbolism in conjunction with the context and their drawings or a model? If students are able to work with symbolism, it is important to also ask them to return to their models and decide if the model indicates that their symbolic work is leading to a valid solution.  2.  Ask questions that lead students  to translate across representational forms, such as picture to picture, number sentence to picture, and number sentence to number sentence:	“Can	you	use	your	map	 to show how both 3/16 and 6/32 refer to the amount that Gardella owns?	Can	you	use	your	model	or	 picture to show how you found your	number	sentence?	Can	both	 these number sentences represent this transaction of land between farmers? How do you know?” 3.  Do not assume that work with  situational contexts, models, and number sentences will explicitly reveal key mathematical ideas such as equivalence and common denominators. Look for appropriate opportunities to highlight these areas during discussion about students’ work.",46,mtms2013-05-527a,,
"Moving from work with physical models, diagrams, and contextualized situations to working with symbolism in a meaningful way can be complex	for	students	(Cramer,	Wyberg,	 and Leavitt 2008). Students do not automatically transfer their work with contextual problems, diagrams and drawings, and number sentences to the formal symbolic work and concepts that are associated with fraction addition and subtraction. Teachers have an important role to play in support-",47,mtms2013-05-527a,,
