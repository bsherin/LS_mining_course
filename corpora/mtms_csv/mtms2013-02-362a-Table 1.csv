"When teachers present middle  school students with problems grounded in engineering principles, students will become active learners and will view mathematics as stimulating and useful. They will also learn that through mathematics, they can be innovative. We present an engineering project called Paper Table, an investigation into building a sturdy table out of newspaper and cardboard. ",4,mtms2013-02-362a,,
"With the advancement of specialized middle schools and high schools focusing on the arts, communication, engineering, mathematics, and science, many students who attend traditional schools miss out on valuable learning opportunities—in particular, when it comes to learning mathematics. Mathematics classrooms can be filled with real-world applications and concepts for all learners, regardless of the school environment.

"Throughout this project, the engineering design process is implemented and connected to middle school mathematics concepts.  the engineering design Process for Middle  school Math Engineering design projects provide an environment in which students can be active, inquisitive, and creative. However, engineering is the one area in STEM education that appears to be	overlooked	in	traditional	school	 environments. This component of STEM	is	likely	ignored	in	schools	because it is not included in most state standards. This situation is unfortunate because engineering provides a real-life application of mathematics.",22,mtms2013-02-362a,,
"The engineering design process is similar to mathematical problem solving (NCTM 2000) and includes the steps shown in figure 1. These steps are rarely executed in a linear fashion, and	designers	often	toggle	back	and	 forth among them as progress is made toward a final solution (Science Buddies 2011).",23,mtms2013-02-362a,,
"On the basis of the geometry  content in the Common Core State Standards (CCSSI 2010) and the engineering	framework	discussed	above,	 we believe an activity called Paper Table (WGBH Educational Foundation	2008)	is	a	viable	task	for	middle	 school students. This activity is part of the Design Squad Nation® program that is broadcast on PBS.",24,mtms2013-02-362a,,
"The show presents real problems that center on building an item and then testing it against requirements.

To test for strength, students push down on the polygon sides and vertices using their hands to get a feel for the amount of weight the polygon can hold (see fig. 3). To reach agreement, group members need to develop convincing arguments to support their choices for the strongest polygon. ",25,mtms2013-02-362a,,
"We suggest that the initial focus  for exploration be on a family of polygons such as quadrilaterals. As shown in figure 2, students are exploring convex and concave quadrilaterals. For	homework,	they	build,	identify,	 and test other polygons. The goal is to encourage students to consider the strength of polygons to support a	sturdy	table	and	make	connections	 between strength and polygon properties,	thus	allowing	students	to	think	 about producing structurally sound table designs.",26,mtms2013-02-362a,,
"Once the connections between shape and strength are established, students move into part 2: creating sketches	and	building	the	actual	paper	 tables using newspaper. After students go through the engineering design process to build a paper table and share their table designs and results, the teacher can decide whether to move on to the extension activities that include concepts of area and surface area, which comprise part 3.  iMPleMenting the  PaPer table Project",27,mtms2013-02-362a,,
Engaging seventh-grade mathematics students in the Paper Table project requires a little more than two class periods (50 to 60 minutes each) and includes assignments completed outside class.

When engineers are given new design projects, they often begin by doing research to familiarize themselves with new objects and concepts related to the project. This is where the mathematics  fig. 5 Sketches of a paper table must precede construction and be functional, not “works of art.” concepts and properties of polygons come	into	play.	Having	some	knowledge of polygons—both convex and concave—allows students to consider all possibilities and how and why the figures can support weight. ",34,mtms2013-02-362a,,
Hold a Design Team Meeting,35,mtms2013-02-362a,,
"The next day, convene design team meetings (10 to 15 minutes) of groups of	three	or	four	students.	The	first	task	 is to determine who will serve in the roles of (1) lead designer, (2) building supervisor, and (3) materials manager—all positions that are aligned with the engineering design process. Several tasks	are	assigned	to	the	lead	designer,	 as shown on the activity sheet, but overall his or her role is to help the team maintain focus, ensure that the design process is documented, and see that all members have equitable opportunities to contribute ideas and to participate. The building supervisor  manages	the	project	by	making	sure	 that there is an equitable distribution of labor during the process. The materials	manager	checks	that	supplies	 are on hand as needed. If technology is available, consider allowing students to capture digital records (i.e., photographs and video) during the build-and-test phase that they can use in their final presentation. If this option is possible, the materials manager would be responsible for handling the digital data collection. ",36,mtms2013-02-362a,,
"Before transitioning to the buildand-test phase, design teams need to show evidence of understanding the problem	and	planning	(i.e.,	a	sketch)	 for their initial paper table. We recommend that the teacher visit each group during the design team meetings to judge whether teams are ready for the next phase. The teacher can ask	students	to	restate	the	task	and	 the problem requirements if teams  lack	clarity.	The	teacher	should	ask	 to	see	design	sketches,	but	he	or	she	 need not validate designs or become a bottleneck	to	the	design	process	flow.	",37,mtms2013-02-362a,,
"The engineering design process will efficiently help designers identify poor designs through testing. If	a	heavy	book	collapses	the	table,	 it is obviously not strong enough. This situation is profitable because it gives students the opportunity to learn about poor design (or poor use of polygons) and to identify ideas for improving or adjusting the design (by selecting other polygons).",38,mtms2013-02-362a,,
"Build, Test, and Redesign",39,mtms2013-02-362a,,
"A large portion of class time should be allocated for the build-and-test phase (45 to 50 minutes). Given the time factor, we anticipate design teams building two or three paper tables each. If the teams are instructed to reuse the cardboard, then the amount of materials needed can be calculated based on the number of design teams. Allot only one roll of	masking	tape	to	each	team.	If	the	 teams	solve	the	problem	too	quickly,	 adjust design requirements. For example,	if	students	are	asked	to	build	 a paper table capable of holding two or	more	books,	allot	three	additional	 pieces of newspaper. ",40,mtms2013-02-362a,,
"Throughout this phase, the  teacher’s primary goal is to ensure that design	teams	are	working	collaboratively to refine their designs. They should not be haphazardly building paper	tables	with	little	reflection	and	 thought about what is causing the design to fail. The teacher can observe students analyzing properties of polygons and encourage students to focus on how situations change or remain the same as one moves from using a convex to a concave polygon.",41,mtms2013-02-362a,,
"The engineering design process is a cognitive endeavor when implemented appropriately and helps learners develop	transferable	skills	needed	to	 engage in complex problem solving in mathematics. If the teacher encounters haphazard design approaches, he or she can intervene with these questions: Why	do	you	think	the	table	collapsed?	",42,mtms2013-02-362a,,
"If you rebuilt the table, what thoughts do	you	have	to	make	it	stronger?	What	 polygons seem to be good candidates for	holding	more	weight?	Why?	These	 types of questions will encourage students	to	think	more	deeply	about	their	 designs and will support them as they build arguments to defend their ideas and critique other groups.",43,mtms2013-02-362a,,
"We	worked	with	middle-grades	 students during a family math night. During their build-and-test phase, they shared several insightful comments about the table structure:  •	 “When	pieces	were	taped	together,	 there was not enough support to stabilize	the	table	to	hold	a	book.” •	 “Looking	at	polygons	to	serve	as	 the legs is important. We need more strength so they will not bend.” •	 “There	was	some	difficulty	in	 getting the taller table to hold the heavy	book.	When	it	was	shorter,	it	 was	easier	to	hold	the	book.”",44,mtms2013-02-362a,,
"These emerging engineers used  reasoning and discussed results from the engineering design process to find a solution that met the requirements. Here are examples of student findings:  •	 “Just	using	the	separate	rolls	as	legs	 and taping them to the cardboard isn’t a great idea. By building it, we saw there wasn’t enough support, so	we	need	to	rethink	how	to	stabilize	things	better.” •	 “The	legs	are	too	wobbly.	We	need	 more	strength	so	they	won’t	bend.” •	 “In	using	a	quadrilateral,	we	need	 to	have	something	like	a	brace	to	 support	the	middle	of	it,	sorta	like	 the diagonals of a quadrilateral or a trapezoid.”",45,mtms2013-02-362a,,
The engineering design process is a cogniTive  endeavor when  implemented appropriately and helps learners develop transferable skills needed to engage in complex problem solving in  mathematics.,46,mtms2013-02-362a,,
"These	comments	suggest	reflections about the table design after a failed test, followed by thoughtful ideas for a redesign to meet requirements. This type of generative discourse is what the teacher wants to hear from design teams. If this level of discussion is not occurring, we suggest	asking	questions	to	help	students	 enter into an iterative design-and-test cycle:	(a)	retest	(b)	reflect	on	design	 failure, (c) collaboratively consider thoughtful ideas for refining the design, and (d) build a new table or adapt the current table if it was not destroyed during the test. ",47,mtms2013-02-362a,,
"The other important element of the design-and-test phase is to describe, in writing,	design	flaws	revealed	from	the	 test and thoughtful ideas for refining the design of the last model, including	a	new	sketch.	These	notations	will	 serve the team well during its presentation preparation as well as help them communicate their findings more accurately. Documenting the design process might be a challenge for many students, so we recommend giving  each team a structured recording sheet with steps identified so that design teams can self-assess their written accounts of the designs and processes (the steps are listed in fig. 1).",48,mtms2013-02-362a,,
"About 5 to 10 minutes before the  end of the build-and-test phase, direct design	teams	to	stop	working	and	 capture their current design status, as shown in figure 6. For example, the teams explicitly describe where they are in the design process, comment about what they anticipate happening during their next test, and why. These reflections	can	be	used	as	evidence	 when preparing the final presentation. By the end of the build-and-test phase, design teams should have a presentation performance rubric and be given time outside of class to prepare for presentations. ",49,mtms2013-02-362a,,
Present Design Team Results,50,mtms2013-02-362a,,
"The final phase, the design team presentations (50 to 60 minutes or more, based on the anticipated average length of time per design team), is arguably the most important component. Students’ learning and understanding of the engineering design process are on display, as is their reflective	advice	to	peers.	Minimal	 guidelines for this phase are included on the activity sheet.

"From a mathematical point of view, the Paper Table project revolves around properties of polygons and mathematical processes and practices. This	task	bridges	other	mathematics,	 such as finding the area of polygons. After producing models, students can ponder ways to find the area of the polygons that comprise the legs of the table. In some instances, students can measure sides, heights, and angles; in others,	they	may	think	about	covering the area with square tiles to get an approximation. ",64,mtms2013-02-362a,,
"In addition to studying area, the visual appeal of the final paper tables can be addressed. In other words, how much paint would be needed to  cover	the	surface	area?	Students	could	 look	at	models	that	did	not	work	 and compare surface area for earlier models versus later models. It would also allow teachers to connect cost to mathematical ideas.",65,mtms2013-02-362a,,
assessing the PaPer table design Project,66,mtms2013-02-362a,,
"Several opportunities are available for analyzing student learning and understanding of the engineering design project, including formative, summative, and performance assessments. For example, the research assigned for homework	could	be	collected	and	used	 diagnostically. This would ensure that students	clearly	understand	the	task	 and design requirements during the design meetings and connect structural design	sketches	to	paper	table	models	 during the build-and-test phase.",67,mtms2013-02-362a,,
"Informal assessment can also occur  during the build-and-test phase. As the teacher visits the design groups and listens to conversations among team  members,	questions	can	be	asked	to	 improve collaboration. During the final visit, a score can be assigned based on the quality of conversation or the progress since the initial intervention. The design team presentation is the summative performance assessment. Scoring is established using a rubric (see fig. 7).",68,mtms2013-02-362a,,
"A creativity category could also be added to the rubric for bonus points. This category would encourage students	to	think	about	attempting	shapes	 other than typical convex polygons for the tabletop. Consider allowing peer assessments or adding a peer-questioning requirement (e.g., each team must ask	at	least	three	questions	to	earn	 a portion of its grade) to encourage students to pay close attention to other design team presentations.",69,mtms2013-02-362a,,
"Finally, to gather evidence of each  individual student’s understanding, we	recommend	asking	students	to	 write	reflectively,	using	one	or	more	 of these prompts: •	 During	the	engineering	design	 project, I contributed to my design team by. . . .  •	 Describe	the	mathematics	you	used	 for the design project and what you learned.",70,mtms2013-02-362a,,
