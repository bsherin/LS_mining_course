3,Mixing Strategies to Compare Fractions,"Strictly teaching algorithms or procedural computations can “encourage children to give up their own thinking” (Kamii and Dominick 1998). Although such procedures are valid for fi nding solutions, students often know only how to use them, and they lack the understanding of why a procedure works. For example, consider the following prospective teacher’s method for comparing 1/6 and 1/8 (Tobias 2009): to students’ ability to use a procedure to solve problems; in other words, it alone will not in other words, it alone will not be enough to allow students to be enough to allow students to be successful with mathematics be successful with mathematics (NRC 2001).

5,Mixing Strategies to Compare Fractions,"With common denominators, the bottom numbers have to be the same. So I knew that 6 and 8 both go into 24. So whatever it [6] takes to get to 24, which is 4, I multiply by the top. And whatever it [8] takes to get to 24, which is 3, I multiply by the top. And since this one is obviously larger, 4 instead of 3 things, 1/6 is bigger.",5,Mixing Strategies to Compare Fractions
6,Mixing Strategies to Compare Fractions,"Although the procedure was valid  for comparing 1/6 and 1/8, its use altered the problem so that it was a comparison between 3 and 4. As a result, 1/6 and 1/8 were no longer part of the problem, and reasoning about these two fractions was nonexistent. ",6,Mixing Strategies to Compare Fractions

11,Mixing Strategies to Compare Fractions,Provide a context,11,Mixing Strategies to Compare Fractions
12,Mixing Strategies to Compare Fractions,"Problems that are placed in a context can help students’ problem-solving abilities or strategic competence (NRC 2001). Word problems allow students to make sense of numbers before they are formally asked to work with them. In addition, providing contextual word problems gives students the opportunity to develop reasoning strategies on their own without being directly told what the strategies are and how to use them. For example, solve the following problem:  After a party, 1/6 of a large mushroom pizza remained, and 1/8 of a large sausage pizza was leftover. Which pizza had more leftover? ",12,Mixing Strategies to Compare Fractions
13,Mixing Strategies to Compare Fractions,How did you solve the problem? ,13,Mixing Strategies to Compare Fractions
14,Mixing Strategies to Compare Fractions,"Chances are the context provided you with a way to visualize what the two fractions represent, and your thinking may have sounded similar to the student’s work shown in figure 1. The student found that 1/6 is greater because an object cut into 6 will create larger pieces than the same object cut into 8. Rather than just finding a common denominator, a context can give students ways to think about what the numbers in the problem represent. The intent of this problem was to have the class develop reasoning strategies related to comparing fractions with common numerators. With common numerators, each fraction will have the sa me number of pieces, and the comparison is in terms of the size of each piece. As seen in the  student’s work, when given a context, he or she was able to reason through the problem and discover that the larger the denominator, the smaller the piece. Without a context, a student may not develop these understandings and instead may revert to computing numbers, as evidenced by the explanation at the beginning of this article.  ask students to exPlain and Justify",14,Mixing Strategies to Compare Fractions
15,Mixing Strategies to Compare Fractions,"Asking students to explain how they solve a problem and justify why their methods work can aid in their development of adaptive reasoning (NRC 2001). This is important to determine if they are using valid methods to construct their answer and in what ways they are finding a solution. For example, consider the following problem:  A birthday party took up two tables. One table had 9 large pizzas for 18 people. The other table had 2 large pizzas for 4 people. Each table shared the pizzas equally. At which table would you want to sit to get the most pizza? ",15,Mixing Strategies to Compare Fractions
16,Mixing Strategies to Compare Fractions,Note that this problem was written  with ratios instead of fractions. This decision was purposefully made to see if students would relate the quantities of 9/18 and 2/4 to determine that each table would have 1 pizza for every 2 people. ,16,Mixing Strategies to Compare Fractions
17,Mixing Strategies to Compare Fractions,"Some students reasoned about  the numbers as ratios to compare the two tables, as seen in the following student’s explanation: fig. 1 Reasoning with a context will allow a student to figure out the larger piece that remained.",17,Mixing Strategies to Compare Fractions
18,Mixing Strategies to Compare Fractions,"It doesn’t matter which table you sit at because they are equal. Both tables have half as many pizzas as people, which is 1 pizza for every  2 people.",18,Mixing Strategies to Compare Fractions
19,Mixing Strategies to Compare Fractions,"By understanding the relationship  between the number of pizzas and people at each table, this student was able to determine that there would be 1 pizza for 2 people at each table. Thus, everyone would receive the same amount. Other students reasoned about how much pizza each person would receive:",19,Mixing Strategies to Compare Fractions
20,Mixing Strategies to Compare Fractions,"Either, because each person, regardless of which table they are at, is getting the same amount of pizza: 1/2 of one pizza. At the table of 18, we can divide each of the pizzas in half because 9 goes into 18 twice. At the table of 4 people, both of the 2 pizzas can also be split in half, giving each person half of a pizza.",20,Mixing Strategies to Compare Fractions
21,Mixing Strategies to Compare Fractions,"This student correctly determined that everyone at both tables receives the same amount of pizza. This thinking was related to how much pizza each person would receive. By understanding that 18 is twice as much as 9, he or she reasoned through what the numbers meant and determined that each table received the same amount because each person would get 1/2 of a pizza. ",21,Mixing Strategies to Compare Fractions
22,Mixing Strategies to Compare Fractions,"As seen with both students’ re- sponses, they determined that people at each table received the same amount. However, some students found this by working with fractions and finding that each person would receive 1/2 of a pizza. Others worked with ratios and determined that 1 pizza would feed  2 people. Although students drew the same conclusion, without an explanation and justification it may not be evident that this answer was derived from using different meanings of rational numbers.  connect strategies",22,Mixing Strategies to Compare Fractions
23,Mixing Strategies to Compare Fractions,"Presenting students with situations in which they can connect strategies with one another can support their conceptual understanding and ability to develop other reasoning strategies (NRC 2001). For example, the class was presented with the problem of comparing the leftover 1/6 pizza to the leftover 1/8 pizza immediately before solving the following problem in which both fractions had the same number of pieces missing.   At the party, the trapezoidal table was decorated with 5/6 spool of ribbon. The rectangular table was decorated with 9/10 spool of ribbon. If both spools had the same amount of ribbon, on which table was more ribbon used?",23,Mixing Strategies to Compare Fractions
24,Mixing Strategies to Compare Fractions,"Evidenced from one student’s explanation, members of the class were able to connect the two problems. The student explained: ",24,Mixing Strategies to Compare Fractions
25,Mixing Strategies to Compare Fractions,"But what we first thought of was kind of in comparison to the last question [leftover 1/6 versus leftover 1/8 pizza], now we are looking for the largest piece. In this case, we are looking for the smallest piece leftover.",25,Mixing Strategies to Compare Fractions
26,Mixing Strategies to Compare Fractions,"From this explanation, the class was  able to start relating this problem to the previous example comparing 1/6 with 1/8. In that situation, students needed to understand that they had the same number of pieces. With this problem, they have the same number of pieces missing. By comparing 1/6 and 1/10, students had to use common numerator reasoning to determine that 1/6 is greater, meaning that 5/6 has more missing than 9/10, and subsequently 5/6 is smaller than 9/10.",26,Mixing Strategies to Compare Fractions
27,Mixing Strategies to Compare Fractions,The missing pieces strategy is the most difficult for students to understand. This strategy requires thinking backward from the common numerator  fig. 2 Students needed to coordinate multiple fractions at the same time when ordering five fractions by size.,27,Mixing Strategies to Compare Fractions

By presenting a missing pieces problem directly after a common numerator situation, students can start to make connections between the two.  have students use MultiPle strategies",35,Mixing Strategies to Compare Fractions
36,Mixing Strategies to Compare Fractions,"Providing students with situations that require them to use multiple strategies at once can be a way to develop their procedural fluency (NRC 2001). According to the NRC, students who are procedurally fluent have a “knowledge of procedures, knowledge of when and how to use them appropriately, and skill in performing them flexibly, accurately, and efficiently” (NRC 2001, p. 121). In other words, when students are given multiple comparisons at once, they need the skills to be able to distinguish between which strategy best fits the given situation. For example, consider the problem in figure 2.",36,Mixing Strategies to Compare Fractions
37,Mixing Strategies to Compare Fractions,"In this problem, students had to coordinate five fractions at the same time. Many started by finding the smallest fraction first. Because 3/20  and 9/20 were the only fractions less than half, students saw that the 3/20 was smaller because both fractions had the same denominators. One student stated, “They’re both out of the same portion.” ",37,Mixing Strategies to Compare Fractions
38,Mixing Strategies to Compare Fractions,"When comparing 7/8 and 23/24, students used missing pieces to determine that 23/24 is greater.",38,Mixing Strategies to Compare Fractions
39,Mixing Strategies to Compare Fractions,"There are more pieces in the first one [23/24]. So, therefore, if the pizzas are the same size, those pieces are going to be smaller. And then since they’re each missing 1 piece, the piece is the smallest one leftover, so it has the most.",39,Mixing Strategies to Compare Fractions
40,Mixing Strategies to Compare Fractions,"Then when comparing 7/8 and  7/13, students saw that the fractions had the same numerator, thus the pieces were larger in 7/8 of a pizza, making 7/8 greater.",40,Mixing Strategies to Compare Fractions
41,Mixing Strategies to Compare Fractions,"Seven is closer to 8 than 7 to 13. And 13 would have more slices, and they’d be smaller.",41,Mixing Strategies to Compare Fractions
42,Mixing Strategies to Compare Fractions,"Presenting an ordering situation  where students had to coordinate more than two fractions at the same time allowed them to think about multiple strategies at once. This type of situation would have been tedious if students only knew how to find common denominators. With multiple reasoning strategies at their disposal, students were able to solve the problem efficiently without the use of an algorithm.  address incorrect student thinking Although students develop the reasoning strategies described, many errors may be prevalent in their thinking as well. A common error in students’ fraction thinking includes reverting to whole-number ideas (Behr et al. 1984). Using whole numbers in fraction problems can provide a way for incorrect student thinking to come to  the forefront of classroom conversations. These misconceptions can then be addressed and used as a foundation for developing correct reasoning. ",42,Mixing Strategies to Compare Fractions
43,Mixing Strategies to Compare Fractions,Take a few moments to solve the following problem before reading on:,43,Mixing Strategies to Compare Fractions
44,Mixing Strategies to Compare Fractions,"The 22 people at the party sat in the party section of the restaurant, which holds 42 people. At the same time, 16 people were in the nonparty section, which holds 36 people. Which section was closer to capacity?",44,Mixing Strategies to Compare Fractions
45,Mixing Strategies to Compare Fractions,The intent of this problem was  to have students compare 22/42 and 16/36 to a benchmark of 1/2 to determine that the party section is closer to capacity because it is more than 1/2 full. This problem was written without fractions to determine if students had incorrect conceptions of fractions based on whole numbers. ,45,Mixing Strategies to Compare Fractions
46,Mixing Strategies to Compare Fractions,"Students used three whole-number  methods to solve the problem. The first method looked at the number of people in each section. When only looking at the number of filled seats, students determined that the party section was closer to capacity, as seen in figure 3. This would be analogous to students comparing fractions by only looking at the numerator. Some students wrote, “Since 22 > 16, 22/42 is larger.”",46,Mixing Strategies to Compare Fractions
47,Mixing Strategies to Compare Fractions,"The second method compared  the number of seats in each section, or the denominators. Students using this reasoning determined that the nonparty section was closer to capacity because the size of each of the 36 pieces is larger than the size of each of the 42 pieces. One student explained that “36 pieces are larger than 42 pieces, making 16/36 larger.” Although students understood the idea that the larger the denominator, the smaller the piece, they only looked at how large each piece was without coordinating this number with the number of filled seats.  fig. 3 Looking at the number of filled seats resulted in a correct answer for an  incorrect reason.  fig. 4 Examining the number of empty seats using an illustration (a) and computation (b) resulted in an incorrect answer for the question asked.  (a) (b)",47,Mixing Strategies to Compare Fractions
48,Mixing Strategies to Compare Fractions,"The third method found the number of empty seats in each section (see fig. 4). Students using this reasoning concluded that both sections were equal. By using a picture (see fig. 4a), or by setting up the fractions 16/36 and 22/42 and subtracting the numerator and denominator (see fig. 4b), students found that both sections had 20 empty seats. From here, they concluded that both sections were equal. One student stated:  . . . when I subtracted, I know  in fractions they both have  20 seats leftover. So wouldn’t  they be equal? ",48,Mixing Strategies to Compare Fractions
49,Mixing Strategies to Compare Fractions,"Posing problems with whole numbers  instead of fractions can provide insight into the types of understandings students have with respect to fractions. This situation brought out several misconceptions that included only comparing numerators, only comparing denominators, or finding how many pieces were missing in each. If students were instead only given a procedure for how to solve the problem, these misunderstandings may not have surfaced.  a Productive disPosition toward MatheMatics",49,Mixing Strategies to Compare Fractions
50,Mixing Strategies to Compare Fractions,"According to the NRC, students’ development of strategic competence,  adaptive expertise, conceptual understanding, and procedural fluency will inherently lead them to develop a productive disposition toward mathematics (2001). Supporting students’ understanding by providing contexts, asking them to explain and justify, and connecting and using multiple strategies will give them the opportunity to develop and gain a deeper understanding of how to reason when comparing fractions. In addition, they can engage in mathematics in ways similar to those emphasized in the Common Core Standards for Mathematical Practice. Supporting ways for students to develop their own reasoning strategies can provide them with a foundation for thinking about the numbers, not just calculating them.
