  1. The length and width of a square are congruent, so the ratio simplifies to 1.",,
27,Sail into Ratios on the Wings of a Kite - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"d.

  The wider kite will have a greater aspect ratio. The width is in the numerator of the ratio; the length is in the denominator. Therefore, a larger width with a smaller length will result in a greater ratio.",,

  Possible answers include a 4 ft. span and a 3 ft. chord; an 8 ft. span and a 6 ft. chord; a 12 ft. span and a 9 ft. chord; and a 6 ft. span and a 4.5 ft. chord.",,

  2.714 mi./hr. When you convert 100 yards to feet and then to miles, you obtain 300 ÷ 5280, or about 0.057 mi. Converting 1 min. 15 sec. first to minutes, then to hours, yields 1.25 min., or about 0.021 hr. The rate, in miles per hour, can be found by applying the distance formula,

33,Sail into Ratios on the Wings of a Kite - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I tried this activity with my prealgebra and geometry classes. Both classes were able to follow the concepts of aspect ratio and sail-loading ratio and complete the problems, but they did not really understand these concepts until we looked at some actual kites.",,
34,Sail into Ratios on the Wings of a Kite - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,I asked students to bring in kites for extra credit. It was fun to measure them and calculate their ratios. The sail-loading ratio was more difficult to calculate because we did not have an accurate scale to measure kite weights. It was interesting to talk about the materials that could be used for building kites and how these materials would affect their weight and thus the sail-loading ratio. Several students actually called their parents (and even one grandfather) who had built kites in their youth to inquire about materials!,,
35,Sail into Ratios on the Wings of a Kite - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Finally, I asked my students to consider a kite's tail. Is it necessary? How long should it be? How will the tail affect a kite's flight? I wish I had planned to fly different kites and test the lengths of their tails.",,

39,Sail into Ratios on the Wings of a Kite - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I used this Cartoon Corner with my seventh-grade mixed-ability students at the end of the school year. We had spent a considerable amount of time on percentages and were working on different types of ratios in our proportional reasoning unit. I explained that the fractions and percentages we had been studying were 
  part-to-whole ratios

  and that this activity involved 
  part-to-part ratios

  .",,
40,Sail into Ratios on the Wings of a Kite - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"To introduce the activity, I showed a picture of a person flying a kite. As a class we brainstormed the factors to consider if we wanted the kite to fly well. The ideas of weight and area of the kite came up, which were nice transitions to the cartoon itself.",,
41,Sail into Ratios on the Wings of a Kite - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I walked the students through problem 1, showing them how to use a ratio table to find the simplest form. I had them try problem 2a, and then we discussed how to find the missing part to confirm that they understood how to use ratio tables. They then worked in pairs to complete the rest of the problems. Although some had studied ratios before, most students were unfamiliar with part-to-part ratios. Some of the more advanced students who had already studied ratios were able to figure out the answers fairly quickly using cross multiplication. I was surprised by how easily the students took to using ratio tables, considering that they had never formally worked with these types of ratios.",,
42,Sail into Ratios on the Wings of a Kite - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"At the end of the class we talked about other areas where aspect ratio is used, such as a computer monitor and a television screen. If we had more time, I would have liked to talk about the common 4:3 and 16:9 aspect ratios of a television screen and what happens when the aspect ratio is not correct. The information at http://wwv.crutchfield.com/learn/learningcenter/home/aspect_ratio .html?showAll=N provides a good summary and some images showing what happens when a picture is not in the correct aspect ratio.",,

46,Sail into Ratios on the Wings of a Kite - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"My sixth-grade prealgebra students struggled with the vocabulary discussed by Charlie Brown in the kite cartoon. Most of the students had never flown a kite and did not know what the terms ""sail-loading ratio,"" ""wingspan,"" and ""chord"" meant. The initial part of the lesson focused on problem-solving strategies, including finding contextual clues, drawing a picture, and substituting familiar words.",,
47,Sail into Ratios on the Wings of a Kite - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Setting up ratios and solving using cross products were review skills. Problem 5's conversion rates provided the greatest challenge. Some students converted yards to feet and then miles, whereas others converted yards directly to miles. Time was converted from seconds to hours, and the values were substituted into 
  d

  = 
  rt

  to solve for the miles per hour. The students determined that they could walk faster than this kite could fly, but that flying the kite would be more fun!",,

51,Sail into Ratios on the Wings of a Kite - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I guided my seventh-grade classes through the problems. My eighth-grade prealgebra students worked a little more independently, although they still got some ""hints"" from other classmates and from me. We have not seen much application of ratios, so we liked these problems. It was a good review of several different middle school topics.",,
52,Sail into Ratios on the Wings of a Kite - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"For problem 5, we had to review 
  d

  = 
  rt

  and discuss different ways to make 1 minute 15 seconds easier to work with. Some classes computed the time as 1.25 minutes and others, 75 seconds. A few students incorrectly thought it would be 1.15 minutes. One of my students commented that it would take a kite 1.25 minutes to fly the length of a football field. I thought that example was a great visual.",,
