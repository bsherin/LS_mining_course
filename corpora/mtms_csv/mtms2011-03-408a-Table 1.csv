"To help our teacher candidates prepare to meet future classroom expectations, we begin our geometry courses by introducing a series of carefully sequenced investigations. These investigations help students begin to construct their own generalizations and formulas by generating data from patterns. They also set the tone for the course; help teacher candidates bring meaning to algebra; and serve as a review of basic geometric terms, which will allow students to reconnect with the language of geometry.",5,mtms2011-03-408a,,
"Before beginning the fi rst investigation, we revisit the basic building blocks of geometry: points, lines, and planes. This beginning discussion punctuates the differences among algebra, arithmetic, and geometry. Next, we move to a discussion of rays and negotiate a class defi nition.

"This fi rst activity asks students to investigate rays. They are to determine the maximum number of rays possible given n points, if no 3 points are collinear. We work as a class exploring the number of rays given 2 points, then 3 points. After we record our results in a chart (see ﬁ g. 1), the students are off and running. Using colored pencils helps students keep track of their work, and the colors make it easier to count the rays accurately. Students work in groups to ensure that the data generated are accurate. Groups quickly note the pattern and can easily generate the next term in the sequence. For many students, fi nding the generalized formula for the number of rays given n points is pretty straightforward, observing that the number of rays can  eEvery semester, we encounter students  who are attracted to the visual and spatial aspects of geometry. We have other students who consider geometry to be challenging for the very same reasons. Students are confounded not only by the fact that geometry relies on visual interpretations but also because it has a language of its own and because the rules can change depending on underlying assumptions. Some students in our teachercandidate classes testify that they are good at algebra but never did well in geometry. The “good at algebra” comment usually translates to being able to complete the symbol manipulation and to “plug and chug” numbers into an equation to return a correct answer. ",8,mtms2011-03-408a,,

",29,mtms2011-03-408a,,
"At this critical junction in the  teaching-learning process, we help our students progress to a global understanding of the problem by moving them beyond recursive defi nitions to functional closed defi nitions. We ask, “How would you determine the number of rays if you had 1000 points and did not know how many rays are possible for 999 points?” This question helps students think about what it means to defi ne the sequence in terms of a general term. Before going on, students describe what the formula represents, and the connection between the geometric model and the algebraic expression. We do not simply accept “it works.” For example, one student wrote, ",30,mtms2011-03-408a,,
"You need a starting point for a ray. There are n starting points. From each starting point, you can draw n – 1 rays. (You can’t draw a ray from the starting point back to itself.) You can repeat this procedure n times. So you would have n(n – 1) rays altogether.",31,mtms2011-03-408a,,

We can name that line AB or BA. Then we ask the class to determine the maximum number of lines possible given n points, if no 3 points are collinear (see ﬁ g. 2).",34,mtms2011-03-408a,,
"Although many students are able to easily connect these two investigations, build on what they discovered investigating rays, and apply their discovery to lines, a few students struggle to make the connection. If they reach a roadblock, we encourage them to compare their results for each set of points in the ray investigation with the line investigation. This is often all the prompting that students need to connect the two. ",35,mtms2011-03-408a,,

Looking at a quadrilateral, we draw the two diagonals and agree that diagonals are segments in a polygon whose endpoints are two nonconsecutive vertices. Students usually determine one of two expressions for the number of diagonals in a polygon with n sides. ",48,mtms2011-03-408a,,

So, I have n(n − 1) segments that go through n points. But I knew that I had double counted the segments so I divided by two. The other problem is that I was counting the sides of the polygon (these are not diagonals). There are n sides so I subtracted n.",51,mtms2011-03-408a,,

"It is important to note that  although  )−( n n( )1 n n( ) − and )−( n n( )3 n n( are equivalent expressions, each expression is very much tied to the geometric model that each student used. If groups do not discover both expressions, we will suggest the alternative expression, explaining that in another class students suggested a different solution. Our teacher candidates, much like their younger counterparts in elementary school or middle school, want their solution to look like the teacher’s solution and do not have the confi dence to manipulate the expressions to certify that they are indeed equivalent. At this point, we  4 WaYs to implement geometry to implement geometry and algebra investigations 1. Modeling and Recording Model how to generate the values as a whole group. Show students how they can use colored pencils to help distinguish elements that must be counted. Swafford and Langrall (2000) found that giving students a teacher-made table helped some students but distracted others and caused them to focus on the recursive relationship between consecutive values in the table. ",54,mtms2011-03-408a,,
"Modeling or sharing different recording methods that students can use  helps to address individual learning styles. For example, some students ﬁ nd that an organized list is easier to see than a diagram, for example, and so on. For other students, this is tedious. Adding additional rows to the table may also help students. In the diagonal investigation on page 411, adding a row and recording the number of diagonals generated from each point lead to the n − 3 expression and the notion that from each point you cannot use the point itself or the two adjacent points.  2. checking Your data",55,mtms2011-03-408a,,
"Bring the class together as a whole to check the accuracy of the values they have recorded in their tables. This check ensures that groups are working with data and patterns that can lead to a generalization.  3. exploring students’ thinking Encourage students to explain their observations, which provide valuable insights into student thinking. Asking other students to restate what they heard and asking questions that help students clarify their thinking are important steps in the transition from verbal explanations to algebraic symbols. Accepting verbal, symbolic, or a combination of verbal and symbolic representations builds on students’ understanding and is a natural transition to more formal structures.",56,mtms2011-03-408a,,
4. asking Questions,57,mtms2011-03-408a,,
"Ask guiding questions to move students forward as you listen to what they have discovered. Questions that can help students bridge the gap between thinking recursively and thinking of the data functionally are particularly important for developing algebraic habits of mind (Driscoll 1999). See, for example: •  What do you know about the deﬁ nition of a diagonal (or ray or line) that  might help you understand your data? •  What do you notice about the data (or values) in the lines investigation  compared with the rays? • What operation can you use to avoid double counting? ",58,mtms2011-03-408a,,
These research-based questions will help you get started in your middle school classroom.,59,mtms2011-03-408a,,
"ask students to use their algebra skills to demonstrate that the expressions are indeed equivalent. This teachable moment reinforces algebraic understanding. We are reminded that even though knowing how many diagonals are in a polygon is important, the process of using a geometric model to make sense of an algebraic expression is an equally valuable lesson. ",60,mtms2011-03-408a,,
"During these fi rst investigations, many of our students focus on recalling formulas that they have used in the past. As the semester progresses, they become more confi dent in generating algebraic solutions for geometric situations. They soon learn that they need to justify their formulas by providing explanations for why their equations make sense. Students are empowered by their ability not only to apply formulas but also to discover them on their own. We are rewarded by our students’ increased confi dence to rely on their own abilities to build meaningful algebraic solutions, not just recall a formula and plug in values.",61,mtms2011-03-408a,,
"iMPleMent it in the classRooM Our observations of our teacher candidates are similar to what Swafford and Langrall (2000) found in their research with sixth-grade students. The researchers focused on the students’ use of equations to describe and represent problem situations prior to formal instruction in algebra. The researchers found that by investigating problem situations, students can build on their intuitive knowledge of algebra and move from recursive thinking to thinking functionally.",62,mtms2011-03-408a,,
"The prior knowledge our teacher candidates bring to this sequence of investigations allows us to push the fast-forward button and investigate the concepts of rays, lines, and diagonals during a single class. For middle  school students, the same sequence of investigations will clearly take more time. However, many of the lessons we have learned working with teacher candidates mirror the research findings of similar activities with middle school students (Driscoll 1999; Swafford and Langrall 2000). See the sidebar at left for our suggestions for classroom implementation.  conclusion",63,mtms2011-03-408a,,
"Making more explicit connections between algebra and geometry will help students build a richer conceptual understanding of algebra. They will also give students mathematical language and symbols to describe patterns and observations while investigating geometric concepts. One former teacher candidate recently shared with us that when her students encounter a problem in her algebra class that involves  geometry, their geometry phobia kicks in, and they immediately shut down. This serves as a reminder that connections between geometry and algebra should not be limited to geometry lessons. Students can become more adept at developing algebraic equations as they investigate geometric concepts during both algebra and geometry courses. Integrating geometry and algebra helps students view mathematics as a connected whole, bringing meaning to algebra through geometry. ",64,mtms2011-03-408a,,
