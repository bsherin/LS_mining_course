0,Leafing through Irregular Shapes - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"By the time middle school students start a prealgebra course, they should have explored a variety of familiar two-dimensional and three-dimensional shapes and should have been exposed to the concepts of perimeter, area, and volume. They know that they can assign numerical values to some attributes of a shape, such as length and surface area. However, my classroom experience confirms the statement that although students may have developed an initial understanding of area . . . , many will need additional experiences in measuring directly to deepen their understanding of the area of two-dimensional shapes (NCTM 2000, p. 242). In addition, the students previous practice with area is usually with polygons, circles, or a combination of both. However, many real-life objects cannot be described or approximated with simple geometric shapes or with combinations of shapes. Therefore, this activity, which asks students to estimate the area of irregular shapes using finer and finer grids, is not only novel but also a way to apply mathematics to real life.",,

2,Leafing through Irregular Shapes - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Although this activity appears very simple, in that it asks students to count squares, it fosters a strong understanding of the concept of area and foreshadows some fundamental ideas from calculus. Analyzing the physical measurement of areas by covering irregular, real-life shapes is worthwhile because it clarifies key concepts of measurement (NCTM 2000). For example, many students experience some confusion about why square units are always used to measure area . . . , especially when the shape . . . being measured [is] not square (NCTM 2000, p. 242).",,
3,Leafing through Irregular Shapes - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In addition, this activity will help students better understand the connection between linear units and square units (e.g., why there are 144 square inches in a square foot). Finally, this lesson also responds to a few of the Common Cores Standards for Mathematical Practice (SMP), such as making sense of problems, reasoning quantitatively, modeling with mathematics, and using appropriate tools strategically (CCSSI 2010).",,
4,Leafing through Irregular Shapes - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,PROJECT DESIGN,,
5,Leafing through Irregular Shapes - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"After reviewing the area of such basic shapes as squares, rectangles, triangles, trapezoids, rhombi, circles, and regular polygons, I usually ask students to find the area of more complex figures that are combinations of those basic shapes. Students generally enjoy this task because they can be creative in composing and decomposing two-dimensional shapes and finding their area in several different ways. Several activity sheets and games are available online that can be used to kick off this lesson (see the online resources sidebar) and which can also be assigned as homework for the night before.",,
6,Leafing through Irregular Shapes - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,CLASS ACTIVITY,,
7,Leafing through Irregular Shapes - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The class activity consists of approximating the area of irregularly shaped, real-life objectssuch as a leaf, a spade or a club on a playing card, a footprint, or the outline of an island on a mapusing grids with finer and finer units.",,
8,Leafing through Irregular Shapes - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"For one of the examples, students trace the outline of a leaf (see fig. 1) on 1 inch, 1/2 inch, 1/3 inch, and 1/4 inch graph paper (see fig. 2). Grid paper in various units can be easily printed from free websites such as http://www.printablepaper.net/. After distributing the activity sheet, I explain the task, and the students begin counting the squares in each of the different sheets. Although each part of the activity is completed individually, the students are divided into small groups. This allows for richer conversation at the end of each section of the activity because most students feel more comfortable speaking up when in smaller groups, especially when there is no simple, unique answer to the problem at hand and when they are being asked to take intellectual risks.",,

10,Leafing through Irregular Shapes - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
11,Leafing through Irregular Shapes - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The same activity is repeated with another object: a students footprint. The students take off their right shoe and use a pencil to outline the shape of their (socked) foot on the 1 inch graph paper. They then trace that same shape (to minimize variations in the shape) on the 1/2 inch, 1/3 inch, and 1/4 inch graph paper and count the squares (see fig. 3 for students work). Finally they repeat the same procedure with a third object of their choice or with the map of a landmark, as noted in the extension activity.",,
12,Leafing through Irregular Shapes - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
13,Leafing through Irregular Shapes - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,DISCUSSION,,
14,Leafing through Irregular Shapes - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The first issue faced by students is how to count the squares (SMP 1: Make sense of problems; CCSSI 2010). Many students are accustomed to problems with clear, set procedures and a unique, definite answer; therefore, this conundrum can consume some time. Students want to know exactly what steps they have to take to find an exact answer, but this is a problem that does not lend itself to this approach. The conversation helps them realize that this is an estimation problem and that the smaller the scale, the more accurate the result (SMP 2: Reason abstractly and quantitatively and SMP 5: Use appropriate tools strategically; CCSSI 2010). Some students decide to eyeball the areas in the boundary squares and add the areas to make one full square. Other students count the boundary squares that are more than one-half full and less than one-half full and average their number (SMP 4: Model with mathematics; CCSSI 2010). The follow-up discussion helps them understand that the various methods of counting do not make much of a difference.",,
15,Leafing through Irregular Shapes - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Measuring the area of the students footprint is usually our starting activity because this task makes for a more open-ended exploration. The students will get different numerical answers because the sizes of their feet vary; however, it is important that they notice that their results are within a reasonable range (and certainly in the same order of magnitude). We have the most meaningful conversations when students grapple with how to (1) measure areas, (2) use units appropriately, (3) think critically about their results, and (4) communicate mathematically.",,
16,Leafing through Irregular Shapes - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"For example, see figure 3a and 3b: Two students who started measuring their footprint with the 1/4 inch graph paper got an initial result of 87 1/4 in.2 and 106 in.2, respectively. Of course, they were startled; they knew that their results were unreasonable because the graph paper in front of them gave them a clear idea of what 100 in.2 really means. After comparing their results with their classmates and discussing it with them, they realized that the common answer was about one-fourth of theirs. In so doing, they identified and corrected the error in their thinking: There are 16 of the 1/4 in.  1/4 in. squares in 1 in.2, not 4, as they had assumed.",,
17,Leafing through Irregular Shapes - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"For the final object, I often like to use the map of a city or a geographical landmark, such as a lake, an island, and so on, that has a scale factor. (See question 10 on the activity sheet.) This object allows for a rich conversation because each square inch actually represents a few square miles. It is therefore easier to show that using a finer grid does result in a more accurate approximation of the area.",,
18,Leafing through Irregular Shapes - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,EVALUATION AND ASSESSMENT,,
19,Leafing through Irregular Shapes - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"This is a particularly valuable activity in terms of its ability to foster a strong conceptual understanding of area and square units. Students get a better understanding of the concept of area and of the difference between surface area and volume of solids. They often refer to this lesson during the school year when they solve problems dealing with square units and with moving from one to the other, for example, moving from square inches to square centimeters. In fact, they also refer to this activity when facing three-dimensional objects and their volume: Once they understand how units work in two dimensions, they can extrapolate to three dimensions.",,
20,Leafing through Irregular Shapes - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I did not write a formal assessment for this lesson. Instead, I gauged student understanding by checking in with individuals and monitoring the large-group and small-group discussions to ascertain that all students have a better understanding of the concepts of the topics involved. I include a few exercises of this type in the warm-ups that we have regularly at the beginning of class and one problem in the unit test.",,
21,Leafing through Irregular Shapes - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"CRITICAL THINKING, COMMUNICATION, AND PROBLEM SOLVING",,
22,Leafing through Irregular Shapes - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I used this activity with seventh-grade students in an accelerated prealgebra class. The projects content and format fosters and emphasizes critical thinking, communication, exploration, and real-life problem solving, which are all features of an enriching experience that can captivate students. The students are excited, if initially baffled, by this project, which provides an intuitive and logical introduction to basic concepts of calculus, such as that of the limit. Students also appreciate the change of pace provided by working with their classmates on an open-ended question in math class. Their positive attitude and successful learning outcomes lead me to conclude that this is a valuable activity that gives students a deeper understanding and a stronger appreciation of the usefulness and effectiveness of mathematics.",,
