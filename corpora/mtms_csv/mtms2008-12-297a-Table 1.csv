It highlights students’ work, including projects, investigations, or creative solutions to the problems in the monthly “Solve It!” department. Original student work is included along with sufficient information about the activity so that readers can try the ideas with their students. Please send manuscripts to the editor, Edward S.

They often used a trial-and-error method to divide the cake into the appropriate shapes. Many students realized immediately that using regular polygons would not be helpful to the task at hand. This problem gave students an opportunity to think about what it meant for a shape to be a hexagon or a pentagon. It forced  them to begin to use examples of polygons other than those typically seen in mathematics textbooks.,16,mtms2008-12-297a,,
"Although most students cut the cake into the appropriate polygons, some students pieced together parts of the cake to form the various shapes. For example, some of my students, Edna, Xianwei, and Jonathan, divided ",17,mtms2008-12-297a,,
"Fig. 2 The process for piecing the triangle, pentagon, and hexagon from a square the cake into four congruent squares (see fig. 2). One square was used for the quadrilateral. The remaining three squares were cut and rearranged to form the triangular, pentagonal, and hexagonal pieces of cake.  •  To make the triangle: The square  was divided into two congruent triangles by cutting along the diagonal. The two triangles were then rearranged to form a larger isosceles triangle.  •  To make the quadrilateral: One uncut square was used for this shape.",18,mtms2008-12-297a,,
•  To make the pentagon: The square was divided into three triangles by making a cut from each corner of one side to the midpoint of the opposite side of the square. The two congruent right triangles were rearranged into a rectangle and placed at the base of the isosceles triangle.  •  To make the hexagon: A triangle was cut from one side of the square. The base was the same length as one side of the square. The triangle was slid to the end of the opposite side of the square to form the hexagon.,19,mtms2008-12-297a,,

"University students, divided the cake into a rectangle, a triangle, and two congruent trapezoids, each with a top area of 16 in.2 (see fig. 3). One trapezoid was cut into four pieces and rearranged to form the pentagon. The other trapezoid was cut into three pieces and rearranged to form the hexagon. These methods of piecing together fragments demonstrated that the transformations maintained the same top area as the original piece of cake used to form the polygon.",22,mtms2008-12-297a,,
"The task also dealt with area. Many students found the area by using combinations of known area formulas. Hannah, a student in David Kirkland’s class at Valley School of Ligonier in Pennsylvania, used ",23,mtms2008-12-297a,,
Fig. 4 Verifying area by using area formulas,24,mtms2008-12-297a,,
"Fig. 5 Verifying area by counting square units combinations of area formulas for a quadrilateral and a triangle where b represented the length of the base and h represented the height of the corresponding shapes (see fig. 4). Many students think of area simply as the result of using a formula and not as a measure of space within a polygon. A few students found the area of each shape by counting square units and half-square units on their grid paper. Rosie, another student of Kirkland’s, did just that, as shown in figure 5. Both methods are valid for finding the area of the shapes, and teachers can help students see the connection between both methods of finding area. However, the counting-boxes method demonstrated that the transformation of the cake pieces maintained the area of the top of the cake.",25,mtms2008-12-297a,,
"The task can easily be expanded or altered to provide students with other opportunities to explore other geometric shapes and their area. The size of the cake can be changed. The number of people sharing the cake can be altered. Changing one or both of these conditions may require students to use fractions when computing the area of each piece and when justifying the area of each piece. The conditions for the division of the cake can also be changed. You can ask students to divide the cake into four different quadrilaterals, for example, and then discuss what it means for the quadrilaterals to be different. This task is very expandable.",26,mtms2008-12-297a,,
