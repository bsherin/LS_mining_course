6,Supporting All Learners in Productive Struggle,"When exploring algebraic functions through a real-world task about viruses, Carlos looked disengaged, sang a rap, and tried to get the attention of a friend in another group. Yasmin looked anxious and frustrated when she tried to locate information about her virus on the Internet. “This is hard,” and “I hate this!” she said. These students and several others struggled on their first day of a demanding multiday task, yet Carlos  and Yasmin, both bilingual Spanish-speaking students  who had recently exited the school’s English Language Learner (ELL) program, seemed to experience significant challenges. As their teacher, my goal was to challenge these students’ mathematical ability in a way that would make their struggle productive. (The first author taught the class reported on in this article; therefore, the “I” and “my” refer to the first author.) ",6,Supporting All Learners in Productive Struggle
7,Supporting All Learners in Productive Struggle,"Productive struggle is inherent in understanding mathematics and solving real-world problems. It can also lead students toward mathematical resilience, encourage retention,  and build growth mindsets (Boaler 2016; Dweck 2006; Hiebert and Grouws 2007). In Principles to Actions: Ensuring Mathematical Success for All, NCTM (2014) defines productive struggle as students delving “more deeply into understanding the mathematical structure of problems and relationships among mathematical ideas, instead of simply seeking correct solutions” (p. 48). Hiebert and Grouws (2007, p. 387) state that struggle does not mean “needless frustration” or “overly difficult” problems but problems within a student’s zone of proximal development, as defined  by Vygotsky (1978). The zone of proximal development is seen as an educational target just beyond what a student can do independently when provided appropriate support. With this in mind, I wondered about the nature of my students’ zone of productive struggle as I developed real-world mathematics tasks with the intent to encourage my students to dig deeper into algebraic relationships and experience productive struggle. At the same time, I also considered the proper nature and level of support I would need to provide.",7,Supporting All Learners in Productive Struggle

I recently conducted research in one of my classes while students worked through several nonroutine tasks on algebraic functions. Using observations, surveys, and an analysis of student work, I found that students were initially frustrated at my attempts to support their productive struggle, especially ELLs, ELLs who had exited the programs (students who had demonstrated English language proficiency), and students with special needs. However, the level of frustration subsided and the productivity increased over time because of the supports I provided.",10,Supporting All Learners in Productive Struggle

During the Virus task, she quit working and said, “I don’t know,” but during the Car task she instead said, “I don’t know what to do right here,” focusing on a particular issue and illustrating her attempts at productive struggle. ",62,Supporting All Learners in Productive Struggle
63,Supporting All Learners in Productive Struggle,"Moving students to struggle more productively required that I consider students’ individual needs, backgrounds, and experiences, as well as my own mathematics teaching knowledge, to plan and enact the lesson. I used a four-component approach (see fig. 3) to support my students as they worked through their productive struggle. Task scaffolding, peer support, and a reassuring classroom environment seemed to help all students,  representations, and explain thinking through analysis (Stein and Lane, 1996). I designed the tasks to support the Common Core’s mathematical content and Standards for Mathematical Practices, specifically those related to making sense of mathematics, persevering, modeling, and constructing arguments (CCSSI 2010). To support productive struggle, multiple avenues of scaffolding were provided within the tasks to minimize obstacles that I anticipated for my students. These obstacles included difficulties with creating mathematical representations, connecting the real-world context to the mathematics, and reading and writing about mathematics. After observing and analyzing students’ work on the Virus task, I modified the Car task to better support my students in their zone of productive struggle. A section of the Car task (see fig. 2) shows where parentheses and bold fonts were used for clarification to decrease potential confusion. Blank tables and graphs allowed students to focus on analysis and discuss their ideas. I bolded relevant vocabulary, defined key terms, and provided sentence starters or frames, as needed, to build students’ confidence with mathematical writing. I added structures, such as “y =” and (____, ______) to clarify question expectations. Analysis questions about key mathematical relationships and representations were included, such as, “What does the solution of the system mean within the context of price paid and car value?” Observations suggest that this scaffolding increased students’ motivation to productively work through their struggles during the task. Increases in overall student scores on the Car task indicated that students developed a more proficient understanding of the mathematics of algebraic functions as compared to the Virus task. ",63,Supporting All Learners in Productive Struggle
64,Supporting All Learners in Productive Struggle,PEER SUPPORT,64,Supporting All Learners in Productive Struggle
65,Supporting All Learners in Productive Struggle,"Throughout these tasks, we found that the support students received from their peers was important and that support did not always need to come from me. While working together in their zones of productive struggle, students realized that they were not alone in having difficulties solving math problems. As a group, they could complete their tasks more efficiently and gain deeper understandings than by themselves. Perhaps more important, we observed that their status differences decreased (Cohen and Lotan 1997). Status reflects a perception by students or their peers of their mathematics abilities and can hinder collaboration, engagement, and learning. For example, Carlos and Yasmin both exhibited signs of low status during the first task about viruses. Many times Carlos was afraid to ask for help or participate in group discussions for fear of looking “stupid.” Yasmin showed stress and became agitated when she did not understand and regularly commented on how “smart” other students were.",65,Supporting All Learners in Productive Struggle
66,Supporting All Learners in Productive Struggle,"After working on these tasks with  peers, however, Yasmin and Carlos both improved in their abilities to struggle productively. For example, during the Car task, because of  Carlos’s knowledge of cars, Yasmin asked him about car make and model and about graphing with technology. She asked another student in her group for help with creating equations. The third student was someone that Yasmin turned to when she needed to talk through her understanding of the mathematics. Yasmin’s strengths as a leader were shown when she checked on the progress of her group members. Being detail-oriented, she was also able to notice mistakes when something in her work did not seem right. ",66,Supporting All Learners in Productive Struggle
67,Supporting All Learners in Productive Struggle,"Depending on students’ past classroom experiences in mathematics, they may or may not feel comfortable struggling together. To support this, I drew on ideas from complex instruction and grouped the students heterogeneously in mixed-ability groups (Cohen and Lotan 1997). We used group norms for help-seeking and help-giving by collectively agreeing to the following: “You have the right to ask anyone in your group for help,” “You have the duty to assist anyone who asks for help,” and “No one is as smart as all of us together” (Cohen and Lotan 1997; Horn 2012). As students worked through these tasks together using the norms, their willingness and ability to give and seek help improved. They began to believe that they each contributed important mathematical abilities. One student stated, “We are all pretty smart, and we are always on the same level.” As this perceived difference minimized, we observed that students persevered more readily, and they were more apt to listen to one another’s mathematical ideas. Student surveys indicated a decrease in anxiety, an increase in students’ enjoyment of math class, and greater understanding of  algebraic functions.

Yasmin was also calmer and more focused on the tasks, stating, “This class feels like it has a lot of support, like whenever you need it.” ",68,Supporting All Learners in Productive Struggle
69,Supporting All Learners in Productive Struggle,TEACHER MOTIVATION,69,Supporting All Learners in Productive Struggle
70,Supporting All Learners in Productive Struggle,"When students are working in a  zone of productive struggle, their  teachers serve as caring confidants, task guides, and motivators. Teachers who believe that all students are capable of learning high levels of mathematics exhibit an ethic of care (Ladson-Billings 1995, p. 473). “Caring for” students, not just “caring about” them, is vital when students hit obstacles, as they do when working on tasks in their zone of productive struggle (Gay 2010, p. 48). I demonstrated caring for my students in several ways, including being available to offer assistance throughout the day, showing interest in  their life experiences and opinions, and giving them my undivided attention during class time. Not only did this care lead to better relationships, but students showed motivation to learn math. ",70,Supporting All Learners in Productive Struggle
71,Supporting All Learners in Productive Struggle,"By building caring relationships with my students, I developed ways to individualize the feedback I gave them through encouragement and praise. My mathematical knowledge and ethic of care shaped the nature of my feedback and the support provided. Meaningful public praise, or assigned competence, raised the status of some students in the classroom by increasing their own beliefs about themselves and their peers’ beliefs about them (Boaler 2016; Cohen and Lotan 1997). For students with lower status, I noticed and provided specific public praise regarding their participation, effort, help-seeking and help-giving, and mathematical strategies. Surveys indicated that students experienced increases in praise over the time spent working on the tasks, and observations showed corresponding increases in students’ motivation and persistence after I assigned competence. Students who already held higher status in the classroom needed a different kind of competence assigned. Observations and reflections of my instruction showed that they were praised more often on their unique strategies, positive attributes of their  analysis, the thoroughness of their mathematical processes, and their willingness to help others. Students responded, “I don’t get frustrated when I don’t know how to do it,” and “The teacher motivates you to try harder.” By building relationships through care, encouragement, and meaningful praise, I supported students to enter and remain in their zones of productive struggle.

73,Supporting All Learners in Productive Struggle,"The classroom environment can serve to provide encouragement and support, or it can stifle engagement and participation in mathematics. My students benefited from a  reassuring and safe environment developed through the existence  and continual adherence to norms and expectations, as well as multiple opportunities for refining their  understanding. Students believed that this classroom was a comfortable place for them to talk about their interests and experiences, as well as a safe place to take risks and make mistakes. Norms for respect, such as “listen to others’ ideas” and “disagree with ideas, not people,” were used to make the classroom an inviting place to work on mathematics, even when discussions got heated (Horn 2012). For example, Yasmin’s math anxiety was high during the first task but steadily decreased over time with more opportunities to practice productive struggle in this classroom environment. ",73,Supporting All Learners in Productive Struggle
74,Supporting All Learners in Productive Struggle,"Multiple opportunities to review and revise tasks were built into the classroom routine during and after the task. During the task, I gave students feedback on prior relevant mathematics learning, task expectations, and misconceptions as they worked toward proficiency of their understanding of algebraic functions and the real-world contexts. Once the tasks were submitted for grading,  students were offered further opportunities to review and revise the task to ensure that they gained proficiency of the mathematics and learned to persevere through productive struggle. These opportunities proved to be beneficial for many students as indicated through student interviews and task scores. They were another avenue of support for any student who struggled with the tasks because of absences, lower reading ability, or the challenges of working through productive struggle. One student said, “This class kind of helps me better because I know what I have to learn and get better at.”",74,Supporting All Learners in Productive Struggle

76,Supporting All Learners in Productive Struggle,"When working in a zone of productive struggle, some students may need just a small lift and some may need something more significant, like Yasmin and Carlos. With these four components in place, more students were regularly within their zones of productive struggle. They were able to be engaged participants in the mathematics content and feel confident that they had support, whenever they needed it. Mathematics teaching and learning with productive struggle is complex; support is needed not only for cognitive development but also for social and emotional aspects. By making use of all four supports, teachers can provide a sturdy and stable structure for students to access demanding mathematics in their zone of productive struggle and create environments where students enjoy coming to math class.
