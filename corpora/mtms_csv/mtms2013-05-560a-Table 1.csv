"High-quality professional development for public school teachers is directly tied to student achievement, teacher quality and retention, and national education priorities (Kroeger et al. 2000). To stay current with the knowledge, skills, and expertise that students need to succeed in the twenty-fi rst century, educators must increasingly retool their instructional strategies and technologies, upgrade the curriculum through new research methods, take responsibility for every student’s competence in core content, and improve student-learning outcomes. To this end, ongoing, high-quality professional development needs to uphold the mission that every public school student will graduate from high school being able to be globally competitive for postsecondary education and prepared for life in the twenty-fi rst century.

"The Center for Defense and Homeland Security (CDHS) at Fayetteville State University (FSU) in North Carolina has instituted a new research and development initiative. The emphasis is on mitigating natural and manmade catastrophic disasters, as well as recovery, within the United States. This research and development initiative is partnering with industry; higher education; the Department of Defense (DOD); the Department of Homeland Security (DHS); and other federal, state, and local entities. The CDHS is engaging in scientifi c technologies in areas critical to U.S. national security. Cybersecurity (biological and chemical countermeasures), C4ISR (command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance),  infrastructure protection, and disaster management are just a few areas under study.",6,mtms2013-05-560a,,
"Through the CDHS, three free workshops were developed and administered by members of the CDHS and FSU School of Education. The workshops integrated high-needs career paths with tenets from Principles and Standards for School Mathematics (NCTM 2000) and the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSI 2010) for data analysis and probability in the middle school. Topics covered included data collected based on a shared characteristic and graphical representations of data, such as histograms, box plots, and scatter plots. The workshop series was titled “Blood, Fighting Plants and Robots: Developing Understanding of Statistical Thinking Using CCSSI.” data were analyzed to determine summary statistics.",7,mtms2013-05-560a,,

"Through collaborative professional development, middle-grades mathematics teachers can directly engage students and, in particular, populations underrepresented in STEM. This professional development initiative offered an extensive collaboration with university faculty and public school teachers to enhance educational opportunities for middle-grades students and also to interest students in STEM careers. Opportunities such as this are a win-win for everyone involved. The students and teachers gain exposure to the latest ideas and technologies that professionals are currently using in their related fields, and professionals gain the opportunity to inspire a younger generation in the STEM workforce. ",9,mtms2013-05-560a,,
"STEM education—specifically, mathematics education—is “valued for its applications in national defense, industrial processes, finance management, medicine, and technology” (Robinson 2009, p. 2). For example, within the fields of cybersecurity and genetics, data management and data-related decisions are essential to securing the nation’s energy supply and critical infrastructure. These fields use a number of mathematical and statistical concepts, such as calculus and statistical inferences of population  data, to develop their end products.",10,mtms2013-05-560a,,
"A knowledgeable and skilled teacher in middle-grades mathematics with knowledge of these fields will impact the pipeline of students who are able to secure the jobs of the future. These national security and intelligence jobs include the areas of data analytics and predictive analysis, virtual reality engineering, genetic engineering, robotics, artificial intelligence, biometrics, and forensic science (Mercier 2011). Sanders and Rivers (1996) suggest that the influence of teachers is the single most important factor in determining student achievement. Therefore, a professional development push will support the knowledge and skill of middlegrades mathematics teachers in the areas of statistical thinking, probability, and instructional technology.

"This professional development initiative was presented to seven local school districts to demonstrate to participating teachers the appropriate curricular connections with the Common Core areas of statistical thinking and content related to homeland security and defense. This work was a collaborative effort between local education agencies (LEA), the FSU School of Education, and the CDHS. The LEAs welcomed the workshop initiative to help them interpret and implement  the Common Core State Standards in Mathematics, with a focus on statistics concepts in middle school.

"Statistical learning in the middle  grades has not been a focus in our area. Therefore, any expertise and innovation to teach the objectives were welcomed. Technology as a tool for visualizing statistical data was also used for conceptual understanding and to motivate students. TinkerPlots® was the computer software used during this workshop, and each participant was provided a copy free of charge.

An in-class observation of participants implementing workshop strategies was an interesting and fantastic learning experience for both researchers and teachers. We have had the opportunity to observe several teachers thus far using the CCSSI (2010) curriculum and technology tool. Students were  engaged and wanted to know more.,31,mtms2013-05-560a,,
"In the seventh-grade mathematics class that we observed, students were learning about data sets and how they can be used to make conclusions about various types of cancers reported in North Carolina. One teacher went to the Center for Disease Control and selected cancer statistics for North Carolina. She then used TinkerPlots to do summary statistics and teach about the inferences that could be made from the summaries. As the data were presented, she asked probing questions, “In comparison to the national average, why does North Carolina have higher cancer rates of certain types of cancers?” Students exhibited enthusiasm when responding with these ideas: ",32,mtms2013-05-560a,,

"Teachers can easily develop statistical lessons for students on topics of interest to them. Gregory Wrape, a seventh-grade math teacher, created an assignment in which his class examined trends involving National Basketball Association Hall of Fame players. Students discovered how to determine summary statistics using data that were meaningful to them. The student work in figure 1 characterizes what students were learning using real data. With some encouragement and more leading questions, teachers easily got the students involved in the learning process and to think about possible STEM-related careers, such as the opportunity to work as an NBA statistician.  iMPleMenting WoRKshoP stRategies",40,mtms2013-05-560a,,
"Workshop strategies can be implemented in small portions depending on teachers’ resources and ability. The pedagogy used in this workshop is not limited to certain technologies or certain data sets. However, to spark student interest in STEM fields, STEMrelated data were analyzed. Several other technologies, such as Microsoft Excel®, can be used to demonstrate some CCSSM statistics concepts. ",41,mtms2013-05-560a,,
"Furthermore, teachers can invite  professionals who are already working in STEM-related fields to collaborate with them. The collaborations can consist of lesson planning and obtaining data sets from the professional. In turn, the professional can provide expertise on certain aspects of the  data set. Essentially, the teacher and professional would team teach the lesson for their class. The professional would be able to share insight as why the statistical concepts were important to his or her profession and why students should learn them.",42,mtms2013-05-560a,,
"Learning statistics with real data can have a lasting impression on student statistical learning. Statistics lessons that use real data can bring a new life to the subject matter and spark students’ natural curiosity to know more. More specifically, instructors can teach statistical concepts while employing a Trojan horse methodology. Students naturally want to know more about things that they are interested in; teachers can harvest this interest and wrap it in the conceptual concepts that need to be covered. The ultimate goal of teaching is getting students to do what you need them to do while convincing them that it was their idea. ",43,mtms2013-05-560a,,
