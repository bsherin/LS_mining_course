The  students  have  chosen  a  “target  number” on the number line and are deep in discussion, trying to fi nd ways to make the sum of the integers on their cards match this number.

"The  students  are  playing  a  game  I  have  developed,  called  “integer  target.”  By  discussing  with students  the  effects  of  giving  and  getting  positive and  negative  cards,  “integer  target”  has  provided a  meaningful  activity  that  has  deepened  students’ understanding  of  integer  computation.  The  article describes how the game is played and the specifi c ways in which it has helped my students make sense of the concepts underlying the addition and subtraction of integers.

Introducing the Concepts,7,mtms2007-03-388a,,
"BEFOrE BEGINNING TO PLaY “INTEGEr TarGET,” we spend  a  day  discussing  relevant  concepts.  Students are placed in groups of two or three, and each group  is  given  a  stack  of  about  four  to  six  cards  (some positive and some negative), a number line, and a marker. We begin talking about ways to find the sum of the cards in the stack.",8,mtms2007-03-388a,,
"Students are asked, “If we have no cards, what is our total?” They respond that the total is zero, so they are asked to place a marker at zero on their number line. Each group then turns over the first card in their stack.  When  they  are  asked,  “What  should  groups with a positive card do? What about those with a negative card?” most groups recognize that those with positive cards should move to the right on the number line and those with negative cards should move left. ",9,mtms2007-03-388a,,
"Once  this  is  done,  they  leave  their  first  card  faceup and draw the second card. They are asked, “how can you move your marker to the place that shows the sum of your two cards?” after some discussion, we agree that we should begin where we left  off  and  again  move  the  distance  and  direction shown by their second card—right for positive and left for negative. We then turn over the third card and continue in this manner until the class is comfortable with adding integers.",10,mtms2007-03-388a,,
"Now  that  each  group  has  a  small  collection  of cards faceup in front of them, we are ready to experiment with giving cards away. Each group chooses a positive card to discard and then find the new sum. Some  groups  are  asked  to  write  equations  on  the board to describe their thinking process. If a group holds the cards –2, 4, 3, and –1, and they give away the 3, some students may write “–2 + 4 + –1 = 1,” reflecting the fact that they have discarded the 3 and added the remaining cards. Other groups will reason that their original sum of 4 will be reduced by 3 to give a new sum of 1 and write “4 – 3 = 1.”",11,mtms2007-03-388a,,
"We continue the process, this time discarding a negative card. The students discover that since getting more negative cards lowers your total, giving up negative cards must increase your total. For example, if they take the three remaining cards, –2, 4, and –1, and discard the –2, they notice that their sum increases from 1 to 3. This can be shown as 1 – –2 = 3, indicating that they began with a sum of 1, gave away a –2 card, and finished with a new sum of 3. The students  verify  it  by  adding  the  two  remaining  cards, finding that 4 + –1 = 3, the same result as before.",12,mtms2007-03-388a,,
"at the end of class, to summarize the project and assess students’ understanding, each person is given a half sheet of paper and asked to respond to the following: 1.  Describe one or two ways that you can move to the right on the number line by getting or giving away a card.",13,mtms2007-03-388a,,

"For the first question, students typically answer that you can move to the right on the number line by either getting  a  positive  card  or  giving  up  a  negative  card. For the second question, they respond that you can move to the left by either giving up a positive card or getting a negative card. Once they understand these basic concepts and become familiar with the cards and number line, they are ready to begin playing “integer target.” These concepts will be developed further after they have played the game, which will be described in the “Following Up” section of this article.

Playing the Game,24,mtms2007-03-388a,,
"ThE  maTErIaLS  USED  arE  a  DEck  OF  66  carDS  (6 of each of the integers from –5 to 5), a separate number line for each player (numbered from –30 to 30), a die, and a green and a red marker for each player.",25,mtms2007-03-388a,,
"The objective of “integer target” is to “hit the target” on your number line by making the sum of the cards in your hand equal a target number that you have chosen in advance. Since target numbers farther from zero are harder to hit, fewer hits are required for these choices. For example, a player who chooses a target number of 6 must hit his or her target four times to win, whereas a player who chooses 26 will only need to hit it once. (See fig. 1.)",26,mtms2007-03-388a,,
"To  begin  the  game,  each  player  chooses  a  target number between –30 and 30 and places his or her red marker on the number line at that location. Next, the cards are shuffled, and each player is dealt four cards faceup from the deck. The players find the sum of their cards and place their green markers at this value on the number line. The red “target” markers will never change location, but the green markers will be moved during each turn to reflect the current sum of the players’ cards.",27,mtms2007-03-388a,,

Play continues until someone wins by hitting his or her target the number of times shown in figure 1. There are a few additional rules to cover special situations.,46,mtms2007-03-388a,,
"1. Players will always have between 0 and 6 cards. If a player has 6 cards and rolls for an action that increases the number to more than 6, the player continues to roll, without taking the action until the player gets a discard, gives, or trades. (a “draw” or “take” action is not taken, since this would give the player even more cards.) If a player receives a card as a result of another player’s action (roll 4 in fig. 2) and it brings the count to more than 6, the “over 6” is handled as indicated above during this player’s next regular turn. ",47,mtms2007-03-388a,,
"If a player has no cards when it is his or her turn, the  player  continues  to  roll,  without  taking  any  of the actions, until the player rolls for a take or a draw. (Without cards, the player is unable to discard, exchange, give, or trade a card.)  2.  Players  get  credit  for  a  “target  hit”  on  their own turn only. If another player’s action moves you to your target, you may still get credit for a hit if you can stay on the target during your own next turn. You may do this, for example, by discarding a 0 card or  trading  one  of  your  cards  for  another  player’s card of the same value.",48,mtms2007-03-388a,,
"3.  Each  player  gets  an  equal  number  of  turns. For example, if the first player hits his or her target enough times to win, the remaining players still get one more chance to tie or win. Ties are broken by awarding  the  victory  to  the  person  whose  chosen target number is the farthest from zero.",49,mtms2007-03-388a,,
"This  example  explores  a  game  played  by  kyle, Jasmine,  and  rita.  They  have  chosen  their  target numbers and have placed their red markers on their number lines. Each has been dealt four cards and ",50,mtms2007-03-388a,,

"Fig. 4  Results of second play in example game has placed their green markers at the location given by the sum of their cards. (See fig. 3.) kyle begins by rolling the die. he rolls a 1, so he draws a card from the top of the deck. Suppose he draws a –4. he adds this card to his hand and moves his green marker four spaces to the left from –3 to  –7.  he  adds  his  cards  again  to  double-check  the sum. The game now appears as shown in figure 4.",52,mtms2007-03-388a,,

"Next, Jasmine rolls a 4, so she must give a card to another player. her current sum is 1, and she needs to move closer to her target number of 13. She reasons that to move to the right on the number line, she will need to give away a negative card. although she could give her –5 card to either rita or kyle, she chooses kyle  because  this  will  move  him  to  the  left,  farther from his target, and it would move rita closer to her target. after she gives the card to kyle, she moves her green marker five units to the right from 1 to 6. kyle moves his marker five units to the left to –12. Both players add their cards again to double-check their locations on the number line. (See fig. 5.)",55,mtms2007-03-388a,,
"It is now rita’s turn. She rolls a 6, meaning that she will trade a card with another player. her target is ten units to the left of her green marker. She looks carefully at everyone’s cards and discovers that if she trades her 5 card for kyle’s –5, she will lower her sum by 10 and will hit her target. She trades the cards, and moves her green marker to –12 on top of her red marker. rita has hit her target one time. She will need to hit it twice more to win. (See fig. 1.) kyle moves his marker ten units to the right and is closer to his target as well. Both players add their cards again to double-check their positions on the number line. Figure 6 shows the current appearance of the game. ",56,mtms2007-03-388a,,
"It is kyle’s turn again. If he rolls a 1 or a 5 (a draw or a take), he will have to roll again, since he cannot have more than 6 cards. he rolls, and the game continues in this manner until a player wins by hitting his or her target the designated number of times.",57,mtms2007-03-388a,,
Following Up,58,mtms2007-03-388a,,
"ThE DaY aFTEr STUDENTS FIrST PLaY “INTEGEr target,” we take time to reinforce and extend what has been learned. To help students build a conceptual  bridge  between  the  concrete  actions  taken  as  part  of  playing  the  game  and  the  abstract  representation of these actions as number sentences, we write  expressions  on  the  board  and  describe  the actions they represent. Then we give the result of the computation. For example, given the expression  1 – –4, students might say that a player begins with a card sum of 1 and gives away a –4 card, resulting in a new sum of 5. We also perform this task in reverse, beginning with the concrete action and finding the equation that would describe it.",59,mtms2007-03-388a,,
"Like the standard integer computation model that uses positive and negative counters, “integer target” has  the  advantage  of  allowing  students  to  build  on their familiar understandings of addition and subtraction as “getting more” and “taking away,” respectively. however,  with  the  “counters”  model,  students  may have difficulty with expressions such as 4 – –3. They wonder how you can take away three negative counters when you have only four positive counters. This is resolved by creating three convenient zeros (positive/negative  pairs  of  counters)—an  extra  step  that can make the basic concept appear more difficult than it really is. With “integer target,” this extra step is not necessary. Students see from their experience playing the game that the number 4 can be the net total of a collection of positive and negative cards. This may already include a –3 card, which can be given away.",60,mtms2007-03-388a,,
"During our follow-up discussion, students will often suggest that the expression 4 – –3 could just as well be written 4 + 3. They point out that both expressions give the same answer, since they both involve beginning with the number 4 and moving 3 units to the right on the number line, which leads naturally to a conversation about subtraction as “adding the opposite.”  as  the  discussion  progresses,  they  see that although the two expressions are equivalent in the sense that they give the same result, they still have different meanings.",61,mtms2007-03-388a,,
"VOL. 12, NO. 7  .  march 2007   391",62,mtms2007-03-388a,,
"To  make  the  connection  with  practical  uses  for positive  and  negative  numbers,  I  also  encourage the students to imagine the positive cards as being money  in  their  pockets  and  the  negative  cards  as debt. We discuss what the various types of actions could  represent.  For  example,  getting  (adding)  a positive card would represent getting more money, whereas (giving away) a negative card would represent having debt taken away or cancelled. In a similar way, we may think of the cards as representing combinations of forces acting in opposite directions. Students can think about the effects of adding and removing these forces.    When  students  play  the  game  a  second  time, they are asked to take a moment during each turn to record on a piece of paper an equation that describes the action they took. I show them explicitly that the form of the equation is  “beginning total” +/– “action card” = “new total.” ",63,mtms2007-03-388a,,
"To help them with more difficult transactions, I give an  example  of  how  to  represent  an  action  that  involves two cards, such as an exchange or trade. Suppose a player has a card sum of –5 and exchanges a 3 card for a –1 card. It may be written as –5 – 3 + –1 = –9 or –5 + –1 – 3 = –9 to indicate that we began with a total of –5, gave away a positive 3 card, and got a –1 card, resulting in a new card total of –9. By collecting these papers containing their explanations at the end of the class, I hold students responsible for carrying out the task while learning of their progress. The preparatory activity from the first day may also be extended. Students sometimes experiment with grouping their cards in different ways and investigating  how  this  affects  the  sum.  having  the cards on the table in front of them makes it easier to see that rearranging the cards does not change the sum. This display can lead to a productive discussion of the commutative and associative properties of addition and may even lead students to develop new  addition  strategies.  For  example,  some  may suggest putting the negative cards in one pile and the positive cards in another, finding each total separately, and then summing the results.",64,mtms2007-03-388a,,
"The rules of “integer target” can be adjusted to meet the needs of different students. The number of cards per player or the range of integers on the cards can be increased or decreased. The length of the number line and the goals for number of “hits” can be adjusted to match. Students can play in teams to  encourage  more  discussion.  To  provide  greater challenge, decimals or fractions can be used on the cards and number line (although the name “integer target” would no longer be appropriate). ",65,mtms2007-03-388a,,
"To provide automatic feedback to students, I have  also developed a computer version of the game. Students enter an equation describing the action taken during  each  turn,  and  they  are  given  immediate feedback  as  to  whether  each  equation  is  correct. The computer version of “integer target” is available at integertarget.com.",66,mtms2007-03-388a,,
