Mario and 4 friends equally share the cost of a $28.02 pizza. While Mario computed each person’s share as $___________, his friends ate the pizza. When Mario realized that the pizza was gone, he yelled, “You guys are a bunch of _______!” 2. Patty got a job ﬂ ipping hamburgers. ",10,mtms2013-02-328a,,

On day 8, the increase was 18,410 burgers short of what was expected. At the end of day 8, she said, “Today I ﬂ ipped    burgers. I enjoy my job because I love the sound of the        .” 4. A student nicknamed Hoops  scored 68.5, 79, 81, 77, and 84.5 on 5 tests. His teacher said, “You will not be able to play basketball until your mean score improves by at least 3 points.” On the next test, Hoops scored 100.6897038. His teacher then said, “Your mean has gone up by  points, so you are now  to play basketball.” 5. A used-car dealer offered to sell a car at 37.79% off the list price of $12,433.

"This activity was completed by fourteen rising sixth, seventh, and eighth graders in a summer math camp at the University of Montana. The students attended several different area schools and had been out of school for six weeks when the problem was given. The majority of the students, the rising eighth graders, considered themselves advanced math students. They needed approximately forty minutes to complete the activity and another twenty minutes to complete the Challenge (although only six students actually completed it). ",30,mtms2013-02-328a,,
"Before beginning the activity, we suggest reviewing prime divisors, percentages, and conversions from minutes to hours. It is important that students use nongraphing calculators so that an upside down “4” looks like an “h.” Also, calculators need to display at least ten digits for some of the problems. ",31,mtms2013-02-328a,,
The students seemed to enjoy the activity although it appeared that solving these types of problems out of context was a challenge. We were surprised at how long the activity took. We were  also surprised by the quality of the story problems that students wrote. One alternative to doing Calculator Spelling as one single activity would be for teachers to ask students to do one item a day as a warm-up problem.,32,mtms2013-02-328a,,
"The following problems were created by students using the word list in the activity.  1.  Rick bought 110,716 boxes that  held 5 pizzas each. His friend said, “Why’d you buy pizzas?” Rich replied, “I __________ over pizza!” (553,580; OBSESS) 2.  One day Bill was asked who the smartest man on Earth was. Bill said, “Get out a calculator and compute 7716 × 2 – 7714, and turn your calculator upside down.” The number was _____ and then Bill said, “You have figured it out! It is _________ !” (7718; BILL) 3.  Bob was researching about endangered spider pigs on his computer. He learned that spider pigs reproduce at a rate of 4 per month, but they are endangered because land developers cut down their homes at a rate of  5 trees per month. They have 27,540 trees in their home. Bob calculated that it would take ______ months for the developers to finish off the land. He said, “I’ll go to the ________ and stop them!” (5508; BOSS) 4.  Ozzie’s mom is taking him school shopping. He has to buy pencils, notebooks, and a binder. He can also buy new school clothes. He spends $5 on pencils, $7 on notebooks, and $11 on a new binder. When he goes to the clothing store, he buys five “cool-guy” designer T-shirts, each for $117.80 (yes, it is an expensive place to go shopping). In total, he  spent $_________, both on clothes and school supplies. The shirt he liked best had his favorite slang word on it: _________ . (612; ZIg) 5.  There were 1000 ducks flying, then 952 joined. Then 50 left, and 2515 came in. Then more joined, and the number of ducks was doubled, and then that number was quadrupled. Now there are ___________ ducks. Later it was discovered that they were not ducks, but actually were _____________. ( 35,336; gEESE)",33,mtms2013-02-328a,,
