"How to Fit Minority and Women’s Studies into Mathematics Class research: aAsk middle school students to name  their favorite musicians, athletes, or actors, and they will tell you everything about them: statistics, hair color, who they are married to, where they live, their accomplishments, and more. Students are exposed to celebrities every day through television, movies, radio, and the Internet. Isn’t it time we expose our students to some mathematical heroes? ",1,mtms2008-09-70a,,

"In February and March, educators teach history lessons on African Americans and women in our various subject areas, which take the form of PowerPoint presentations and discussions. However, there is little opportunity for students to research these important historical figures, because of all the material that teachers are expected to cover and skills that the students are expected to learn during the school year. It is impossible to add one more ",4,mtms2008-09-70a,,

"Mount Hebron Middle School in Montclair, New Jersey. She is interested in helping students discover real-world applications of mathematics.  not learn mathematics in a vacuum. In every other subject in their middle school studieslanguage arts, social studies, science, art, and music—students study the people who made and make significant contributions to the field. However, I was not surprised when I asked my students to name some mathematicians from history; they had difficulty coming up with five names. And of those five mathematicians named, none were female or minority. If students can find themselves reflected in the pages of history, they may be inspired to pursue a career in mathematics. By researching men and women who have made contributions to the field of mathematics, our young scholars may find a role model. In so doing, we may be able to stem the tide of the shrinking number of students entering the field of mathematics by helping them become interested in its history. ",6,mtms2008-09-70a,,
"Further, the study of mathematics  history is imbedded in our national and state-based mathematics standards. NCTM discusses the importance of reaching across other disciplines in understanding mathematics. Many mathematicians who have become part of the chronicles of history are also scientists, physicians, and business executives, among other professions. NCTM’s Communication and Connections strands and New Jersey’s Mathematical Process strand instruct us to teach our students to recognize recurring themes across mathematical domains; recognize that mathematics is used in a variety of contexts; trace the development of mathematical concepts over time and across cultures; recognize and use connections among mathematical ideas; understand how mathematical ideas interconnect and build on one another to produce a coherent whole; and recognize and apply mathematics in contexts outside of mathematics (NCTM 2000; State of New Jersey Department of Education).",7,mtms2008-09-70a,,

"To fit mathematics history into the middle school classroom, I started with an idea and a grant proposal. Through grants made possible by the Montclair Fund for Educational Excellence (MFEE) and the Montclair State University Network for Educational Renewal (MSUNER), history books were made available to students in class. Although it would be difficult to fit additional work into a seventy-minute block in which I see my students every other day, I wanted to create a unit plan that would use minimal time in the classroom but would require more preparation of students and teacher.",9,mtms2008-09-70a,,
"The unit, titled “Minorities’ and ",10,mtms2008-09-70a,,
"Women’s Presence in Mathematics: A Historical Perspective,” is a yearlong project that can be adapted to many different learning and teaching styles. For instance, I repeat this project annually with my students who loop (students and teachers who move to the next grade level together). ",11,mtms2008-09-70a,,
"Attention to these mathematicians  need not be reserved for one month  per school year. The project described here begins in September and continues through May. Students research their mathematician and create oral presentations about one notable individual. Each class hears between fifteen and twenty presentations on different mathematicians, depending on the number of students in class. ",12,mtms2008-09-70a,,
"This is an ideal project for an  interdisciplinary unit. Mathematics teachers can team with a social studies teacher because of the historical element or with the language arts teacher because of the writing and researching involved. Science is a natural overlap, because many mathematicians are also scientists.",13,mtms2008-09-70a,,
"At Mount Hebron Middle School,  the Science and Technology magnet school for our district, our students take a technology class as a core subject and have access to a computer lab. For this project, students are required to use the Internet and find at least one online source that is helpful to them, so they are allowed to conduct some research online at school. If these resources are not available at your school, this project can be completed without the online research component. (However, you will probably be satisfying your state’s mathematics and technology requirements by having students work on this project using the Internet.) ",14,mtms2008-09-70a,,
"You can also ask the school media  specialist or librarian to help obtain resources for this mathematics project. This staff member can also assist the students, by class or individually, when researching their topics. (This individual may also be a good resource when investigating grant money for future projects.)  setting up the lesson",15,mtms2008-09-70a,,

"Students are assigned a female or  a minority mathematician to research. At first, I was going to limit their research subjects to African American and female mathematicians. However, while doing my own research, I discovered many mathematicians who have been delegated to the outskirts of society based solely on race, ethnicity, or gender, so I widened the search.",43,mtms2008-09-70a,,
"The challenges I face with a middle school population are (1) the reading difficulty of the material and (2) the level of complexity of the mathematicians’ discoveries or inventions. I sometimes suggest particularly accessible mathematicians to various students. Another approach  is to assign a research subject and a specific discovery or invention. For example, someone could research Benjamin Banneker and his invention of a wooden clock that ran for fifty years. Each student is required either to submit a one-page written report or complete the Mathematicians Biography Form (see activity sheet 1), according to skill and grade level. The report assignment requires that the bibliography include at least two books and one Web site reference. Students give a five- to ten-minute oral presentation to the class, which includes a brief question and answer session about the mathematician they researched. Additionally, each student produces a poster or other visual aid about their mathematician. A “Famous Mathematicians from History” bulletin board displays all the projects to date. Students are given a rubric designed for this project (see fig. 1). ",44,mtms2008-09-70a,,

"To get involved and help students with the research process, create lunch or study groups with several students every month. This is an opportunity to teach them how to help each other and that research can be fun. In addition, five minutes during class or lunch can be reserved for one-on-one conferences on students’ progress. Although this sounds like a lot of time, if different students work on their project throughout the year, and you have 100 students, you will be seeing approximately 10 students each month.

In addition, for students working on this project who  are looking for extra credit, have a list of other famous mathematicians ready, such as Fibonacci, Ptolemy, Pythagoras, and so on.

The success of this project requires that books be purchased for classroom use. The Resources section at the end of this article lists some books you may want to purchase. Some books contain general information; other books about individual mathematicians are excellent resources for middle school students. ,65,mtms2008-09-70a,,
"However, if your budget is limited, start with these titles. Make sure you include several books to reach students at their particular reading skill level. Once you assemble your book cart, make it available in your room to your students at all times. Although sharing resources with other teachers is preferable, the students are better served if the books and materials are available in your classroom only. When students complete an assignment, they should be able to work on their mathematician from the book cart available in your room. At Mount Hebron, we have regularly scheduled DEAR (Drop Everything and Read) periods; I sometimes offer a book to a student who has forgotten it that day.

"I am thrilled by my students’ investment in the project and their reactions to the mathematicians they present. One question that comes up in every class, regardless of the mathematician’s gender, is this: “Were they married, and did they have any children?” I inquire why they deem that so important. Their response in all classes is that they are not sure if they would have time in their own lives to have a family and produce that kind of work. I have found a few students already imagining what it might be like to be a mathematician. Some students ask about the mathematician’s discoveries and inventions or about how and when he or she died. Many students report on inventions or ideas not often discussed in a middle school mathematics class, such as high-end calculus and Boolean geometry. The students find it interesting even if they cannot understand all of it.",67,mtms2008-09-70a,,
It is not uncommon for students to complain to me about the inability to find material on their subject. I use this as an opportunity to discuss how some people have been written out of history and suggest that we can help write them back into history by presenting them to our classmates and posting something about them on our history wall.  conclusion,68,mtms2008-09-70a,,
"As with any undertaking, the hardest part is getting started. This article contains the groundwork to get teachers started.
