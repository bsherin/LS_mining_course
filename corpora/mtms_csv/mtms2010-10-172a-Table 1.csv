"Good books afford the possibility of drawing out the voices of our students. Using good books is not just another curricular gimmick that we can “do” with children. Rather, literature gives children an opportunity to raise questions, make personal connections, frame mathematical ideas in their own language, and extend stories in their own ways. By using literature, we celebrate children’s voices and build inquisitive mathematical communities. (p. 504) geoMetry in a  georgia classrooM",3,mtms2010-10-172a,,
"Georgia is in the process of introducing a new curriculum in K−12 mathematics. Students in the seventh grade are expected to be able to— 1.  construct plane figures using both technology and compass and straightedge; 2.  demonstrate understanding of transformations of plane figures; 3.  use properties of similarity of plane figures; and 4.  “sketch, model, and describe cross-sections of cones, cylinders, pyramids,  and prisms” (Georgia Department of Education).

One framework titled “Slices and Shadows” (http://www.georgiastandards.org/mathframework.aspx), used here with Flatland: The Movie, involves studying properties of plane figures and three-dimensional shapes, creating three-dimensional shapes by transforming plane figures, and exploring cross-sections of three-dimensional shapes.",6,mtms2010-10-172a,,

"Dimensions by Edwin A. Abbott (1998), first published in 1884. It is the perfect story to accompany the study of three-dimensional objects, their properties, and their representation in two dimensions; however, the Victorian language of the book makes it difficult for some middle-grades students to read. With the release of Flatland: The Movie, an animated and modernized version, the mathematical ideas about dimension expressed in the book have become accessible to a younger group of students. ",11,mtms2010-10-172a,,
"The protagonist is A. Square, a  creature who lives in a two-dimensional world with other polygonal (usually regular) plane figures. A strict class structure is found in Flatland: The Movie: The higher the class, the more sides to the polygonal creature. The holiest creatures are those who have so many sides that they approximate a circle. Although most Flatlanders  never consider the possibility of a third dimension, A. Square encounters a three-dimensional being (a sphere) as well as a one-dimensional being (a line).",12,mtms2010-10-172a,,
"In the movie, a secret society of  circles guard an area of Flatland where a cube can be seen rotating through the two-dimensional world, its intersection with Flatland constantly changing in size and shape. A. Square and his daughter reveal the truth about the secret area and the third dimension. ",13,mtms2010-10-172a,,
"The book and movie are rich in mathematical ideas. The concept of dimension is a main theme, but other concepts—angles, polygons, crosssections, perspective, transformations, similarity, congruence, and circles as polygons with an infinite number of sides—also play roles. ",14,mtms2010-10-172a,,

"The day before beginning the seventh-grade unit Slices and Shadows, two classes were shown the movie and two classes were not.

The teacher found that the students who saw the movie were able to use it as a model throughout the unit. The students who had not seen the movie did not have such a ready model to use during the unit. The teacher also said that the movie served as a hook and that students became interested in cross-sections of threedimensional objects. Word of the movie passed among the classes until all the students in the school wanted to see the movie. The teacher noted: “The kids loved that movie.

No students in any of the classes identified trapezoids or pentagons as possible cross-sections in the pretest.

Using a story Based  on the Movie,31,mtms2010-10-172a,,
"The two classes who had not seen the movie before the unit were eager to see it, so the teacher showed it to all four classes at the end of the unit. After the viewing, the students were given a special assignment, which began with students’ reading the story shown in figure 1, “The Trojan Octagon.” The ",32,mtms2010-10-172a,,
Fig. 1 The assignment began with the story of the Trojan octagon. ,33,mtms2010-10-172a,,
"As everybody knows, the members of the ruling class in Flatland are “circles”—polygons with so many sides that they resemble circles. The members of the lowest class of Flatland are isosceles triangles, brute soldiers hungry for power and envious of circle-priests. Throughout Flatland’s history, there have been rebellions of isosceles triangles trying to overthrow the circlepriests, but none were successful. The legend is that the circle-priests have a secret weapon that they use to destroy the rebel army. The secret has been carefully guarded inside the circle-shaped castle where circle-priests gather during times of danger.",34,mtms2010-10-172a,,
"In 1500 B.C. (which, of course, means before the circle), the new rebel  army commander, the isosceles-triangle Triton, decided to penetrate the castle and obtain the secret that protects the circle-priests. Triton was a rather sharp triangle, but he realized that a cunning scheme was needed to succeed. He devised the scheme according to a story about a Trojan Octagon he had heard a long time ago in the army school. A group of triangles were to glue themselves together and pretend to be a polygon of many sides so that the circle-priests would not recognize them as simple triangles. The operation was to be called the “Trojan Octagon.” Once in the castle, the triangles, squeezed together in the Trojan Octagon, would carefully listen to find out where the secret was kept. Then they would steal it. ",35,mtms2010-10-172a,,
"The plan worked perfectly until the triangles in the Trojan Octagon, being sharp but dumb triangles, could not understand the sophisticated way that the circle-priests were talking. So they decided to run away so that they would not be recognized and destroyed by the secret weapon. ",36,mtms2010-10-172a,,
"Triton was furious, but he realized that he needed help from an insider.  ",37,mtms2010-10-172a,,
"He needed a traitor. He found one in a slightly imperfect octagon by the name of Button. Button explained to Triton that to succeed, Button had to be in the middle of the Trojan Octagon with the triangles arranged around him to form an octagon. Button would then listen to the circle-priests’ conversations and discover where the secret was kept. During the night, he would lead the Trojan Octagon to the place, and the mission would be accomplished.",38,mtms2010-10-172a,,
"“The only problem is,” Button said, “How do we construct this Trojan ",39,mtms2010-10-172a,,
Octagon?” ,40,mtms2010-10-172a,,
"The plan that Button devised for the mission was very successful. The  mission was so successful that the rebellion that followed overthrew the rule of circle-priests and put the brute triangles with their leaders in power. Their tyrannical rule lasted for another 1000 years after which a young hero by the name of Hercagon, but that is a completely different story. ",41,mtms2010-10-172a,,
Fig. 2 The Trojan Octagon was constructed using The Geometer’s Sketchpad from a square.,42,mtms2010-10-172a,,
"Fig. 3 This construction of the Trojan Octagon was created on a grid with congruent isosceles triangles.  story is about a group of isosceles triangles in Flatland who aspire to defeat the higher class and obtain their secret weapon through the disguise of a Trojan Octagon. The students read the story aloud in each class and were given the following tasks:  1.  Make precise drawings of the Trojan Octagon, which includes the character called Button.  2.  Draw a cartoon describing the  story.  3.  Extend the story. ",43,mtms2010-10-172a,,
The teacher decided that she would provide nothing more than these instructions and let the students’ creativity and mathematical instincts work freely. ,44,mtms2010-10-172a,,
"The fi rst task of making precise  drawings for the Trojan Octagon was intended to exercise students’ ability to construct plane fi gures, a skill that is part of the seventh-grade curriculum. There are various ways to construct an octagon, and the added requirement of the surrounding isosceles triangles provides another challenge. The construction can involve transformations, parallel lines, squares, triangles, a coordinate system and equations of lines. Figure 2 shows a rotated-square construction using The Geometer’s Sketchpad. Figure 3’s construction involves using a grid and  congruent triangles that surround the central octagon. ",45,mtms2010-10-172a,,
"Figure 4 shows how students represented the Trojan Octagon. Out of 74 students, 43 drew it as an octagon, with each side of the central octagon as a base of an isosceles triangle; 16 had diffi culty visualizing it, either using shapes other than an octagon and a triangle or using a nonconvex polygon that clearly is not approaching a circle; and 15 used a large number of different sizes of isosceles triangles. ",46,mtms2010-10-172a,,
"None of the students used the  constructions that they had learned in the classroom to precisely construct the Trojan Octagon. Students often do not recognize the need for mathematical procedures and skills in new contexts. In the future, the instructions for the task will be reworded as follows: ",47,mtms2010-10-172a,,
"Suppose you are an engineer for the Trojan Octagon project. Carefully construct the Trojan Octagon, containing Button, and describe how you did it. ",48,mtms2010-10-172a,,
"There can be other opportunities to use the mathematical skills that students have learned in this project. For example, as part of the specifi cations for the construction, ask students to consider the area and perimeter of the object. They could also be asked to specify the angles in each of the triangles and the octagon. ",49,mtms2010-10-172a,,
"In the second and third activi- ties, the students created a cartoon and extended the story. The purpose was simply to get the students to be creative and to use their imaginations to think about mathematics, in particular, the mathematics of shape and dimension, and play with the concepts and the vocabulary. When students are given an opportunity to express themselves in this way, it also gives the teacher many opportunities to start a discussion about mathematics and learn about misconceptions that students might have. ",50,mtms2010-10-172a,,
"The most striking feature of the cartoons and stories was the creative effort displayed by many students (see fi gs. 5a, 5b, and 5c). The students were clearly very engaged, thinking about and playing with mathematical objects. ",51,mtms2010-10-172a,,

All of them were a great, normal family. Until one day, Herc, short for Hercules, went to sleep and was kidnapped into the 4-D world. He had over heard his parents talking about Hex, the hero who found the third dimension possible. But he had never expected to be the prophet of the 4-D realm. The Amazing Actagonal Allizal was the new 4-D figure who taught Herc of her ways. She happened to have cubes as her faces and bases, and edges were her vertices. This dimension was unimaginable to any and everyone. Herc couldn’t believe it even though it was right in front of his eyes. She looked so diverse to all the other things he had seen. After this he mentioned it to the Triangles, who didn’t believe him one bit. They could barely grasp the concept of the third dimension. Despite their denial he got through to the citizens with the help of Allizal, and eventually became ruler of all dimensions.

Why, for example, did the student (see fig. 5a) choose to show the shadow of a cube in Flatland rather than a cross-section; was he or she aware of the difference between a cross-section and a two-dimensional representation of a three-dimensional object? How would the student (see fig. 5b) use the protractor as a secret weapon, and why did this student construct the Trojan Octagon as a star-shaped creature? ",60,mtms2010-10-172a,,
"The story in figure 5c shows quite  advanced thinking about the fourth dimension and a four-dimensional cube: “She happened to have cubes as her faces and bases, and edges were her vertices.” The student was making the connection in his or her own words between a three-dimensional cube, in which the faces are twodimensional squares and the edges are one-dimensional lines, with a fourdimensional hypercube, in which the “faces” are three-dimensional cubes and the “edges” are two-dimensional squares. Another student said, “Once the three-dimensional figures were on their side, they attacked the circles from both the two-dimensional and three-dimensional perspectives.”  discUssion",61,mtms2010-10-172a,,
"Students with artistic and creative temperaments sometimes view mathematics as a rather dry subject, far removed from art and literature.
