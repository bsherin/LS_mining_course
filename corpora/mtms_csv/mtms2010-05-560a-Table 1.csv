Knitting Patterns,2,mtms2010-05-560a,,
"Making a pattern or writing instructions for knitting a sweater involves detailed calculations to ensure that the sweater will fit. The pattern for a particular sweater will vary, depending on the thickness of the yarn and the size of the needles used. The information that must be considered when writing a pattern depends on the gauge of yarn that is used, which is calculated from the number of stitches per inch in a row and how many rows are in an inch of length. ",3,mtms2010-05-560a,,
Pat is knitting a sweater with the following gauge printed on the yarn label: 20 sts / 26 rows = 10 cm / 4 inches,4,mtms2010-05-560a,,
"This means that 20 stitches (width) or 26 rows (length) will produce 4 inches (10 cm). The back of Pat’s sweater will be 22 inches long and 18 inches wide. Before she begins, she must cast on stitches, in other words, generate the first row of stitches.",5,mtms2010-05-560a,,

"PRoBleMs 1.  How many stitches will Pat cast on    b.  How many stitches will each  sleeve’s width increase? to get the correct width? 2.  How many rows will Pat knit to get the full length of the sweater? 3.  Sleeves are generally wider at the  armhole than at the wrist. The circumference of each sleeve of Pat’s sweater will be 15 inches at the armhole and 9 inches at the wrist. Pat will increase 2 stitches every few rows so that the sleeve gets wider. From the wrist to the armhole, the length of each sleeve will be 18 inches long.  c.  Knitters produce 2 stitches, not 1, on an increase row. Over the length of the sleeve, how many increase rows will Pat knit?   d.  Complete the instructions for  knitting a sleeve to the armhole:    Cast on ____ stitches. Increase 2 stitches every ___ rows until the piece has ____ stitches  per row and until the piece is 18 inches long (approximately ____ rows).",7,mtms2010-05-560a,,
a.  How many rows long is the sleeve from the wrist to the armhole?,8,mtms2010-05-560a,,
"The solutions are appended to the online version of “Math for Real” at  www.nctm.org/mtms.  solutions to math for real (Continued from page 560) solUtions 1.  Students can consider how 4 inches would be evenly distributed among 20 stitches, which means that each inch gets five stitches. This can relate ratios to generalization of division. For 18 inches of width, Pat will cast on 18 × 5 = 90 stitches.",9,mtms2010-05-560a,,
2.  Find the number of rows in 1 inch  of length by making the ratio 26 rows to 4 inches into a unit ratio: ,10,mtms2010-05-560a,,
"This ratio results in 6.5 rows per inch. For 22 inches of length, Pat will knit 22 × 6.5 = 143 rows.",11,mtms2010-05-560a,,
"3.  a.  From question 2, we know that Pat will get 6.5 rows per inch; 6.5 × 18 = 117 rows will be necessary for each arm.",12,mtms2010-05-560a,,
"  b.  The sleeve must increase in width by 15 – 9 = 6 inches; therefore, 6 inches × 5 stitches = 30 stitches will be the width increase over the length of the arm.  c.  From parts a and b, we know  that Pat will increase 30 stitches over 117 rows, which is 117 rows  ÷ 30 stitches = 3.9, or 4 rows. Since she will increase 2 stitches on every increase row, she can increase by 2 stitches every 8 rows.",13,mtms2010-05-560a,,
  d.  The starting width of 9 inches is 9 × 5 = 45 stitches. The ending width of 15 inches is 15 × 5 = 75 stitches.,14,mtms2010-05-560a,,
  Cast on 45 stitches. Increase 2 stitches every 8 rows until the piece has 75 stitches per row and until the piece is 18 inches long (approximately 117 rows).,15,mtms2010-05-560a,,
