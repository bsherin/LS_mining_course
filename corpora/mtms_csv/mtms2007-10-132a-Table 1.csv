"The Finger and the Moon aA Tanzanian proverb reads, “I pointed  out to you the moon, and all you saw was the tip of my finger.” This proverb came to mind as I was looking at cases of students working with decimals and the difficulties they were having (Barnett, Goldenstein, and Jackson 1994). It dawned on me that part of the difficulty is that we use the decimal point as a pointer to indicate the place value of the digits around it and that many students focus on the finger (the decimal point) and not the moon (the place value).

"Students are not the only ones who  sometimes focus on the finger rather than on the moon. In a lesson with teachers on ways to teach decimals in a meaningful way, we used base-ten blocks as one of our learning tools. After stating that we would use the flat as our unit, teachers promptly found the value of the other pieces. They figured out that the long would be 1/10, or 0.1, and that the small cube would be 1/100, or 0.01. They agreed that the result of ",3,mtms2007-10-132a,,

"Hundredths multiplying a long by 10 would be a flat, that is, 0.1 times 10 would be 1, because 10 longs make a flat. They also agreed that multiplying the small cube by 10 would be a long, that is, 0.01 times 10 would give 0.1. (See fig. 1.) ",7,mtms2007-10-132a,,

"Hundredths object. Then I asked them to multiply each piece on their display by 10 and to represent the answer on the mat, both with blocks and with digits. (See fig. 2.) Teachers promptly grabbed the corresponding bigger pieces and put them in the corresponding columns and wrote down the digits in their corresponding columns. They saw, to their surprise, that the decimal point had not moved. All of them had learned that to multiply a number by 10, you simply move the decimal point right or left following a set of rules. These teachers realized for the first time that the effect of multiplying a number by 10 could be understood in terms of looking at the value of the digits before and after the multiplication by 10, rather than looking at the point. They saw that students would have a deeper understanding of multiplication of a number by 10 if they would describe it in terms of moving each digit to the next placevalue column, rather than talking in terms of moving the decimal point. “Moving the decimal point” is a convenient way of talking about and operating with written symbols in much the same way that it is convenient to say that the sun rises in the east and sets in the west. Neither statement is sensible; students need to understand that the apparent movement of the sun is because the Earth rotates around its axis, not that the  sun is orbiting the Earth. In the same way, students need to understand what happens to the digits in terms of place value when multiplying or dividing by 10, rather than just focusing on the apparent movement of the point. ",16,mtms2007-10-132a,,
"Another example for helping students increase their understanding involves adding numbers containing decimals. Students often focus on aligning decimal points. Their understanding would be improved by describing the situation in terms of aligning similar place values, that is, adding tens to tens, units to units, and tenths to tenths. By focusing on place value, students would know what to do when one of the numbers does not have a decimal point. Students who focus on the decimal points to align numbers often need to rely on additional rules, such as “add a decimal point to the right of a number that does not have a decimal point.” Such rules detract rather than add to students’ understanding. ",17,mtms2007-10-132a,,
"There are other “moons” related  to the decimal point. When dividing decimal numbers, students’ understanding would be enhanced by thinking in terms of multiplying the divisor and the dividend by the same power of 10, thus keeping the answer the same. Students who change a problem like  0 25 1 25 0 25 1 25 0 25 1 25 into  25 125 can see why the answer is the same in both cases by thinking of the analogous situation of the multiplication of a fraction by 1 in the form of 100 25 125 100 25 125 100 100 100 100 rather than focusing on the dragging of the decimal point the same number of places. ",18,mtms2007-10-132a,,
"When operating with decimal  numbers, students can change a multiplication problem like 1.2 × 1.4  into the corresponding multiplication problem 12 × 14 involving whole numbers. They can see that with this change, each factor has increased by a factor of 10, so that the answer, 168, is greater by a factor of 100 than the answer corresponding to the original problem. Just focusing on counting decimal places to reinsert the decimal point is again analogous to concentrating on the finger. ",19,mtms2007-10-132a,,
"The decimal point is not the only  “finger” when dealing with the “moon” of place value. Rules such as “add a zero” when multiplying a whole number by 10 also make students miss the central idea that the value of each digit in the number has increased by a factor of 10 and therefore moved to the next column. The zero holds a place for the units column, which is now empty because the digits have moved to columns where their value is 10 times greater. ",20,mtms2007-10-132a,,
"What are other “fingers” and “moons” in our teaching of mathematics? Readers are invited to identify pointers that end up distracting students from understanding the important ideas and to think about ways to help students concentrate on the ideas and submit them to “Readers Write.” Bruce Lee’s advice to his student in Enter the Dragon was this: “Don’t concentrate on the finger, or you will miss all the heavenly glory.” In the same way, we need to guide our students not to concentrate on the pointers only or they will miss all the understanding.
