"Do we sometimes discount the mathematical thinking of students because they use nonstandard language, even though their logic might be sound? A personal experience brought this question home to me. Last year, while diving near Grand Cayman, dive masters asked us to tell them if we sighted a lionfish so that they could capture it. (The lionfish is indigenous to the Pacific Ocean and is an integral part of the ecosystem because it has natural predators; however, in other oceans the fish is a menace.) I found a lionfish on one of our dives, and when back on the boat, I very carefully told the dive master how to locate it. He looked at me strangely and said:",3,mtms2012-02-379a,,
"I can’t find the fish by knowing where some blue sponge is. Next time, tell me how far into the dive you are and in what direction you went.",4,mtms2012-02-379a,,
"I was frustrated with him because  my directions to the fish were very clear. Then I began to wonder if we as teachers sometimes frustrate our students by not listening to their mathematical thinking. The week preceding the dive trip I, too, had “looked quizzically” at a student who shared her thinking about ratios. I reacted in ",5,mtms2012-02-379a,,

She might not have used the precise mathematical language that you and I would use, but what she was saying had mathematical value.",6,mtms2012-02-379a,,
"Proportional reasoning is difficult for students to develop (Lamon 1993, 1995). One reason is because elementary school and middle school students continue to find fraction concepts challenging (Kouba, Zawojewski, and Strutchens 1997; Watanabe 2002). Many times, this lack of development can be traced back to the way that teachers present problems involving proportional reasoning. ",7,mtms2012-02-379a,,
"Developing flexibility in working with rational numbers contributes to an understanding of, and facility with, proportionality. This facility involves much more than simply setting two ratios equal and solving for a missing term. It involves recognizing quantities that are related proportionally and using numbers, tables, graphs, and equations to think about the quantities and their relationship (NCTM 2000, p. 217).",8,mtms2012-02-379a,,
One very effective way to help students view quantities and how they are related is by using familiar contexts for exercises involving ,9,mtms2012-02-379a,,
Fig. 1 This standard tree-shadow problem was an application of angle-angle similarity.,10,mtms2012-02-379a,,
"I an and Jake want to lay out a garden for Lynea. To do this, they need to know the height of the tree located at A. The boys set up a yardstick at B, 6 feet from the tip of the shadow of the tree where the shadows of the tree and yardstick coincide at C. Using the information given in the diagram, calculate the height of the tree. Assume that both triangles are right triangles. Explain the meaning of the proportion used to solve the problem.",11,mtms2012-02-379a,,
Fig. 2 This question helped reveal whether or not students understood the importance of equal parts in a ratio.,12,mtms2012-02-379a,,
Question:,13,mtms2012-02-379a,,
"Two polygons are similar and have a ratio of 3:2. In one pair of corresponding sides, the shorter side is 13.2 cm. What is the length of the longer side? common solution: 2 13 2.3 2.",14,mtms2012-02-379a,,
"proportional reasoning (Heller et al. 1989). The concept of ratio is a critical aspect of proportional reasoning, and one common misconception about ratio involves the issue of equal parts (Kaput and West 1994). This article describes two examples of student thinking about ratios and proportional reasoning:  1.  How one student made sense of a  proportion in a familiar context; and 2.  How a second student conceptualized ratio. ",15,mtms2012-02-379a,,
"I report the students’ thinking because it is signifi cant: In years of teaching a geometry course, I have not heard students communicate this level of understanding about proportionality. In addition, I want others to see how students who think proportionally approach problems.",16,mtms2012-02-379a,,
"My geometry class was studying similarity, which is a concept that invokes proportionality. A homework exercise required students to fi nd the height of a tree, given the length of the tree’s shadow and an object of known  height and the length of its shadow (see ﬁ g. 1). This exercise used angleangle similarity of two right triangles.",17,mtms2012-02-379a,,
"During our discussion, one student  said that she understood how to set up and solve the proportion, but it did not make sense to her why the proportion worked. I tossed the question out to the rest of the class and asked them to explain how they had made sense of the proportion. One student said,",18,mtms2012-02-379a,,
"I thought of it this way. The yardstick has a shadow of 6 feet. So for every 6 feet of shadow, the object rises 3 feet above the ground. Since the tree has a shadow of 36 feet, this tells me the tree rises 6 times the amount of the yardstick, or 18 feet. So the tree is 18 feet tall.",19,mtms2012-02-379a,,
"The student’s thinking showed that he saw the ratio of the length of the yardstick to the length of its shadow as the foundation of the proportion. Using this foundation, he then compared the height of the tree with the length of its shadow,  x = 19.8 cm, the length of the longer side.",20,mtms2012-02-379a,,
"which connected his thinking to the standard way of solving the problem. The student’s interpretation of what the proportion in the exercise meant made perfect sense to the student who had asked the question. In addition, this interpretation affi rmed for me the importance of context to communicate how a proportion works. The interpretation also shows that the student recognized the quantities that are related proportionally and the meaning of the proportion because it related to a familiar situation. ",21,mtms2012-02-379a,,
Another exercise in the same  homework assignment was designed to see if students understood ratio and how to use it. I was most interested to fi nd out if my students understood the importance of equal parts in a ratio because this aspect of ratio causes many misconceptions while students are developing proportional reasoning. Figure 2 shows the exercise and the solution that most of my students found.,22,mtms2012-02-379a,,
"At this point, I asked my standard question: Did anyone complete the exercise in a different way? One  student raised her hand and shared her solution:  is important in teaching ratio and proportion: ",23,mtms2012-02-379a,,
"First, I divided 13.2 by 2 to get 6.6, and then I added 6.6 to 13.2 to get 19.8.",24,mtms2012-02-379a,,
"There were many confused looks in the room. Because many of my students were visual learners and did not follow auditory explanations well, I asked this student to go to the board and share her work. Her explanation showed a clear understanding of ratio.",25,mtms2012-02-379a,,
"I know that the shorter side is 6.6 + 6.6 = 13.2 because the ratio tells me that it contains two equal parts. This means that the longer part must contain three of those equal parts, or 13.2 + 6.6 = 19.8, or 6.6 + 6.6 + 6.6 = 19.8.",26,mtms2012-02-379a,,
Her work on the board and her thinking showed a clear understanding of ratio in that she connected it with equal parts. Figure 3 shows her work and my interpretation. ,27,mtms2012-02-379a,,
I learned from these two examples  that these students have a strong understanding of proportionality. My conjecture is that their understanding developed from the way in which they were taught and how they made sense of proportions and ratios. These two examples affi rmed for me what ,28,mtms2012-02-379a,,

6 6 6 6 .6 6 1.  The meaning of a proportion makes more sense to students when situated in a context that is familiar to them.  2.  The conceptual understanding of ratio can be seen in the student’s response in ﬁ gure 3 because the student used equal parts in the solution and solved the exercise without setting up a proportion. ,42,mtms2012-02-379a,,
"When teaching proportional reasoning, it is important to avoid asking students to set two ratios equal to each other, one with a missing value, and then to solve for that missing value. When students move to crossmultiplication for a solution, they lose the connection of proportionality among the original quantities. ",43,mtms2012-02-379a,,
"To develop proportional reasoning with understanding, familiar contexts must be used and the missing value cannot be our ending goal for the exercise. It is important to ask students to interpret the proportion in a way that fi ts the context of the exercise. Similarly, when we teach ratio, it is important to have students make the connection about comparison of equal parts. I challenge and encourage readers to refl ect on these issues related to how we teach proportionality—using proportions in familiar contexts and ensuring that our students understand that a ratio compares equal parts—because both are important in the development of proportional reasoning.",44,mtms2012-02-379a,,
