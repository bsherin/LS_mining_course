"mMathematical proof is an expression of deductive reasoning (drawing conclusions from previous assertions). However, it is often inductive reasoning (conclusions drawn on the basis of examples) that helps learners form their deductive arguments, or proof. In addition, not all inductive arguments generate more formal arguments. This article draws a distinction between inductive reasoning, which successfully lays the foundation for more formal arguments, and other inductive reasoning, which does not. The strategy of identifying inductive arguments that prompt formal arguments is an important skill for both middle school teachers and teachers of prospective middle school teachers.",5,mtms2009-12-286a,,

"Figure 1 is an example of how a middle school student might convince others of the validity of a formula for counting figurative numbers. To bring the point home, Principals and Standards (NCTM 2000, p. 264) states, “Although mathematical argument at this level lacks the formalism and rigor often associated with mathematical proof, it shares many of its important features.” ",7,mtms2009-12-286a,,
"What is it about the argument  in figure 1 that lacks formalism and rigor? The answer is that the argument is inductive; it is a generalization that has been made on the basis of evidence, in this case, empirical evidence. However, the argument is stronger than merely testing Gauss’s formula for a few cases, which is purely empirical evidence. That is because the argument is what Morris (2007) calls a “single-case key idea inductive argument.” In other words, ",8,mtms2009-12-286a,,

Because the teacher may have to facilitate this link, we need to be skilled in recognizing key idea inductive arguments and expanding the argument into a proof. Expanding a key idea argument means to write it so that it is general; this means the argument works for all cases, not just the ones tested. This can be done using symbols or prose.

"Arguments involving number theory and geometry problems can easily transition from inductive to deductive. however, some teachers may find it challenging to find good problems for student investigation. Below are some sample statements (and their corresponding key ideas) that teachers can use in their middle school classrooms: (key idea: B and C both have a factor of A.) 1. if A divides B and A divides C, then A divides B + C.  2. the sum of two odd numbers is even.  3. the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.   (key idea: odds are even numbers plus 1.) (key idea: three copies of any triangle can be arranged in the form of a trapezoid so that the three angles are supplementary; the parallel postulate is needed.)  4. if a reduced whole-number fraction is equivalent to a terminating decimal,  then the fraction’s denominator has only 2s and 5s in its prime  decomposition.

The reverse of the left and right side of the equations is a subtle difference but important. The author of the argument in figure 3c may not hold a key idea about the statement, which is supported by the comments at the end. It differs from the argument in figure 3a in that it tests several cases (empirical evidence), as opposed to developing a systematic way to produce all cases.  at the end tells us that the argument contains a key idea: If you choose any odd number, we could continue this pattern until we would finally obtain the odd number you chose. The process develops a systematic way to generate any odd number, and this process can be developed into a more general argument.",44,mtms2009-12-286a,,
"The key idea in figure 3b is dif- ferent. The key idea is that every odd number is an even number + 1. This even number is the double of some whole number, and this double can be written as a sum. Add 1 to one of the summands, and you have the sum of two consecutive numbers. We call this a constructive argument because it shows how to construct the consecutive numbers.",45,mtms2009-12-286a,,

"Consider figure 3c. At the end of the argument, the reader is left with this notion: If you picked any arbitrary odd number, then you would be able to find the two consecutive numbers. However, we are not given any insight into how we can be certain.

"The argument in figure 3a, however, tells you how to “build” to the number you picked. It is as though you were saying, “With enough time, this process will bring you to your chosen number, no matter how big it is.” Although the conclusion remains uncertain, we are at least given a foundation for the logic. (To expand this argument into a formal one would require mathematical induction, which is a strategy for proof that is beyond the scope of middle school. Nevertheless, the logical foundation expressed in fig. 3a is accessible.)",49,mtms2009-12-286a,,
"The argument in figure 3b describes a process for finding the consecutive numbers. The algebraic representations suggest how to expand the key idea in this argument into a deductive argument.

The sum of these two numbers (k + k + 1) is your original number.

"Key idea argument evaluation can be used to avoid making false generalizations through inductive reasoning. The Reasoning and Proof Standard for Grades 6−8 contains two examples to illustrate pitfalls in using inductive reasoning (see fig. 4). The first involves a conjecture that a number is divisible by the product of any two of its factors (NCTM 2000, pp. 264−65). This false conjecture might arise from developing a test for divisibility by 6. When discovering a divisibility rule for 6—a number must be even and the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3—students might incorrectly extend this notion of divisibility by products of factors to all numbers and their factors. It should be noted that this false conjecture does not arise from key idea thinking. The inductive reasoning lacks a key idea. The key idea behind the conjecture for 6 involves noting that 2 and 3 are relatively prime, and this notion was not involved in the conjecturing process.",57,mtms2009-12-286a,,

This example of inductive reasoning also lacks key-idea thinking. A key idea would include reasoning (beyond actually measuring the segments) that justifies that the new segments formed are not repeated segments. For example, students should note that repeated lengths can appear when  with {a, b} being different from {c, d}. In the 5 × 5 case, a = 5 and b = 0 produces a length already considered in the 4 × 4 case, c = 4 and d = 3.
