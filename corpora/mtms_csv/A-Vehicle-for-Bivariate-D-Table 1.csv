0,A Vehicle for Bivariate Data Analysis - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Instead of reserving the study of probability and statistics for special fourth-year high school courses, the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSM) takes a  statistics for all approach. The standards recommend that students in grades 68 learn to summarize and describe data distributions, understand probability, draw random samples, make inferences, and describe associations. In response to the growing needs of the nation in the area of data literacy (e.g., Franklin et al. 2007; U.S. Department of Labor 2014), changes to the mathematics education landscape require that students be given the opportunity to use statistics to create mathematical meaning from data. This article addresses this challenge by presenting a vehicle to meet many of the  Common Cores expectations.",,
1,A Vehicle for Bivariate Data Analysis - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"It should come as no surprise that cars fascinate many eighth graders. In Montana, for example, a learners permit allows teenagers to operate a motor vehicle starting at age 14 1/2. Drivers education classes are offered during the summer to students entering high school. Learning to drive is one of the great passages to adulthood. Many eighth graders eagerly look forward to the freedom and social status that accrue from driving an automobile. I have found that many eighth graders, in spite of being on the verge of driving, know little about cars. They hold misconceptions about which models are best sellers, how fuel economy varies, how engine power differs, and how much cars cost.",,
2,A Vehicle for Bivariate Data Analysis - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
3,A Vehicle for Bivariate Data Analysis - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,The dataset shown in table 1 capitalizes on the learning opportunity that best-selling cars present to the eighth-grade teacher who is seeking to develop lessons on the bivariate association of quantitative data. The data provide seven quantitative measures for the 30 top-selling vehicles in America in 2013. These measures are each described below:,,
4,A Vehicle for Bivariate Data Analysis - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,1. Rank: Rank in 2013 sales,,
5,A Vehicle for Bivariate Data Analysis - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"2. Price (MSRP): Manufacturers suggested retail price for entry model, in dollars",,
6,A Vehicle for Bivariate Data Analysis - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"3. Fuel Efficiency City Driving (FEC): Manufacturers  advertised fuel consumption,  measured in miles per gallon,  for city driving",,
7,A Vehicle for Bivariate Data Analysis - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"4. Fuel Efficiency Highway  Driving (FEH): Manufacturers advertised fuel consumption, measured in miles per gallon,  for highway driving",,
8,A Vehicle for Bivariate Data Analysis - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,5. Curb Weight (CW):  Manufacturers advertised  curb weight in pounds,,
9,A Vehicle for Bivariate Data Analysis - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,6. Torque (TQ): Manufacturers advertised engine torque  measured in foot-pounds,,
10,A Vehicle for Bivariate Data Analysis - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,7. Horsepower (HP): Manufacturers advertised engine power measured in horsepower,,
11,A Vehicle for Bivariate Data Analysis - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The data set provides an ideal environment for an exploration of bivariate quantitative data. Within the seven variables in the data, 42 bivariate studies are possible and many linear associations exist. Some of these linear associations are strong, whereas others are weak. Examples of positive, negative, and no association are also found. In many comparisons, one car is persistently categorized as an outlier, whereas clusters of cars are also found.",,
12,A Vehicle for Bivariate Data Analysis - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"To exemplify one potential study employing the dataset, consider an investigation of horsepower versus torque. Horsepower is a measure of a cars ability to move weight a certain distance per unit of time, whereas torque is a measure of twisting force that the engine exerts on the drive shaft. Are these two variables associated? If so, what direction is the association? If the association is linear, what can the equation of the line of best fit teach us about how these two variables are related?",,
13,A Vehicle for Bivariate Data Analysis - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The Common Core standards advocate that students be able to construct scatterplots, identify clusters and outliers, and state the direction of association between two variables. An initial scatterplot, displayed in figure 1, shows a moderately strong, positive association between the two variables of power and torque. In addition, several clusters can be identified. Eight cars have high torque and power (the plot shows only seven because two of these cars have exactly the same torque and power). This cluster corresponds to trucks (e.g., the Chevrolet Silverado) and large sport-utility vehicles, or  SUVs (e.g., the Ford Explorer). Fourteen cars have midrange torque and power. This cluster includes midsize sedans (e.g., the Honda Accord), small SUVs (e.g., the Toyota RAV4), as well as one small truck (the Toyota Tacoma). Finally, six cars have low torque and power. This cluster includes small sedans, sometimes called economy cars (e.g., the Nissan Sentra), exclusively. Figure 2a identifies these clusters.",,

15,A Vehicle for Bivariate Data Analysis - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
16,A Vehicle for Bivariate Data Analysis - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"CCSSM expectations for students in eighth grade include learning how to informally fit a straight line to scatterplots that suggest a linear association. One informal approach is to identify two points that define a line in such a way that half the data fall above the line and half the data fall below. In our example with power versus torque, two such points are the Jeep Grand Cherokee (260, 290) and the Toyota Camry (170, 178). A line passing through these two points has a slope, m, given by:",,

18,A Vehicle for Bivariate Data Analysis - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The equation of the line that passes through the two points is of the form y = mx + b. Substituting the slope and the point (170, 178) into the equation, we can solve for the unknown y-intercept b.",,
19,A Vehicle for Bivariate Data Analysis - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
20,A Vehicle for Bivariate Data Analysis - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Therefore, the equation of the informally derived line of best fit is  y = 1.24x  33.6.",,
21,A Vehicle for Bivariate Data Analysis - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Contextualizing the algebraic solution to our setting, where y is the power (measured in horsepower) and x is the torque (measured in foot-pounds), we arrive at the linear model",,
22,A Vehicle for Bivariate Data Analysis - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,power = 1.24  torque  33.6.,,
23,A Vehicle for Bivariate Data Analysis - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,The graph of the line corresponding to this linear model is displayed in figure 2b.,,
24,A Vehicle for Bivariate Data Analysis - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Perhaps most challenging for eighth graders is the Common Cores recommendation that students learn how to use the equation of a linear model in the context from which the data are drawn. One potential use of the model is the analysis of lower than average or higher than average power given torque. Analysis of the Chevrolet Silverado data (at far right and circled in blue in fig. 2b) shows that its torque of 305 foot-pounds would predict, according to our linear model, a power of 1.24(305)  33.6 = 344.6 horsepower. However, the Silverado possesses only 285 horsepower; therefore, we can conclude that the Silverado has an engine with a lower than average horsepower, given its torque. This analysis identifies the Silverado as an outlier, a point that does not follow the trend that the linear model describes.",,
25,A Vehicle for Bivariate Data Analysis - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Students should also learn to interpret the slope and y-intercept in the context from which the data are drawn. Here, the slope of 1.24 = 1.24/1 can be interpreted as a ratio of rise (change in horsepower) to run (change in torque). The linear model predicts that an increase of 1 foot-pound of torque is associated with an increase of 1.24 horsepower. A contextualized interpretation of a y-intercept of 33.6 might be described in this way: A car with 0 torque has 33.6 horsepower. Such a conclusion is nonsensical. Rather than an indication of the models inaccuracy, the nonsensicality of the y-intercept here points to limiting the models application to the range of the data, power ratings from 98305 horsepower and torque ratings from 105305 foot-pounds. The discussion of goodness of fit for any model is important; models are mathematical creations meant to approximate real-world phenomena and, as such, are prone to regions of inaccuracy and restrictions.",,
26,A Vehicle for Bivariate Data Analysis - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,A CLASSROOM APPLICATION,,
27,A Vehicle for Bivariate Data Analysis - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"My class of middle school teacher candidates developed and delivered a three-day lesson for eighth graders using this dataset as a mathematical vehicle for learning about bivariate association of quantitative data. The lesson spanned three consecutive instructional periods of fifty minutes each. The goal of the lesson was for students to experience a real-world, data-driven exploration of bivariate data in which they made conjectures, carried out analyses, and explained results in small-group settings. Students had already studied the algebra of linear equations; were familiar with the slope-intercept equation for a line; and could find the equation of a line, given two points. The students had also studied bivariate association and knew how to characterize direction, form, and strength of association. Our lesson was aimed at expanding students previous understanding of the algebra of writing equations for lines to the bivariate quantitative data setting using our newly created dataset as an educational vehicle.",,
28,A Vehicle for Bivariate Data Analysis - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Day 1: Getting Familiar with the Data,,
29,A Vehicle for Bivariate Data Analysis - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"During the first instructional period, students were divided into small groups of three to four members, and each student was given a copy of the data. Variables were introduced and explained by the teacher. Much time was spent explaining the meaning of torque: a measure of twisting force useful for short bursts of power. To explain the variable more fully, imagine trying to loosen an overtightened bolt with a wrench. One foot-pound of torque can be envisioned as the twisting force that is applied to the bolt by applying 1 pound of force on a wrench that is 1 foot in length. Five foot-pounds of torque can be envisioned as the application of 5 pounds of force on a 1-foot wrench, or 1 pound of force on a 5-foot wrench. In response to the teachers question, What is torque good for? one student offered the following, If you need to tow something, you need a lot of torque to get going.",,
30,A Vehicle for Bivariate Data Analysis - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Horsepower is also a variable unfamiliar to many middle school students. Horsepower is a measure of a cars ability to apply a force over a certain distance per unit time. Different than torque, horsepower is a measure of a cars ability to provide power over time. For example, cars with high horsepower are able to maintain their speed on the highway when traveling up a long, steep hill. Historically, this measure of power was invented to compare the power of a steam engine to that of a horse.",,
31,A Vehicle for Bivariate Data Analysis - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Once students had gained familiarity with the variables presented in the data set, a process that took fifteen minutes, students were given twenty minutes to inspect and discuss the raw data in small groups to produce three conjectures about how different pairs of variables associate. Students were encouraged to use their previously acquired language of association to conjecture about the direction, form, and strength of association between pairs of variables in the data set. Students were also encouraged to reason why such an association might exist. At the end of the period, conjectures were shared with the class and written on the front white board. Some of these conjectures included the following:",,
32,A Vehicle for Bivariate Data Analysis - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Weight and highway fuel  efficiency will be negatively  associated because heavier  cars will use more gas.,,
33,A Vehicle for Bivariate Data Analysis - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Fuel efficiency on the highway  and fuel efficiency in the city  will have a strong positive  association because cars that  get good mileage in the city  seem to get good mileage  on the highway.,,
34,A Vehicle for Bivariate Data Analysis - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Price and fuel efficiency will  be negatively associated because the expensive cars like trucks and large SUVs do not get as good  mileage as inexpensive cars  like the Toyota Corolla.,,
35,A Vehicle for Bivariate Data Analysis - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Power and curb weight will be positively associated because  heavy cars need bigger engines  and more power to move them.,,
36,A Vehicle for Bivariate Data Analysis - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Price and power will be positively associated because a more powerful engine costs more to make.,,
37,A Vehicle for Bivariate Data Analysis - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"After all conjectures had been presented, the teacher asked each group to chose a different pair of variables to investigate on days 2 and 3.",,
38,A Vehicle for Bivariate Data Analysis - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Day 2: Analyzing the Data,,
39,A Vehicle for Bivariate Data Analysis - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"During the second instructional period, students in small groups began their analysis. The teacher explained that each group would be given three pieces of gridded poster paper on which they were to illustrate the results of their investigation and present them to the class on day 3. The poster pages were to be used as follows:",,
40,A Vehicle for Bivariate Data Analysis - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Poster 1: A scatterplot of the data complete with correctly labeled axes, a title, a line of best fit (if  appropriate), identified clusters  (if any) and identified outliers  (if any)",,
41,A Vehicle for Bivariate Data Analysis - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Poster 2: Documentation of the mathematical reasoning leading to the linear equation of the line of best fit, including calculations and algebra",,
42,A Vehicle for Bivariate Data Analysis - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Poster 3: A written summary of the results of the investigation, including the identification of the variables studied; the direction, form, and strength of association; the linear model found; and  the meaning of the slope and  y-intercept of the linear model",,
43,A Vehicle for Bivariate Data Analysis - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Once these tasks were identified, groups began independent work. Constructing the scatterplot proved challenging for many groups because differences in scale for the two variables studied required a careful choice of unit for both the x- and y-axes. The teacher helped by asking students questions:",,
44,A Vehicle for Bivariate Data Analysis - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,What are the maximum price and minimum price for the  cars in the data set?,,
45,A Vehicle for Bivariate Data Analysis - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,How do these numbers inform  us so that we can construct  an informative graph of the  data?,,
46,A Vehicle for Bivariate Data Analysis - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"After axes had been drawn and scaled, plotting the 30 points followed. Although this task proceeded slowly at first, it accelerated as groups self- organized into point callers and point plotters.",,
47,A Vehicle for Bivariate Data Analysis - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Once a picture of the data was constructed, students characterized the association as positive, negative, or none. Form was assessed as linear or nonlinear; if linear, the descriptors strong or weak were added. In every bivariate study chosen, students correctly anticipated the direction of association. Many, however, were surprised to find the association to be linear in form. The strength of association varied greatly. Several groups identified and described clusters and outliers in their scatterplot. Others discussed why particular cars in the data set (e.g., the Toyota Prius) did not fit the trend of the data.",,
48,A Vehicle for Bivariate Data Analysis - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"When this initial exploration was complete, group effort shifted to constructing the second poster, exploring the mathematical reasoning leading to the linear equation of the line of best fit.",,
49,A Vehicle for Bivariate Data Analysis - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Reasoning varied greatly. Some chose to draw a line of best fit that balanced the number of points above and below; they then placed two convenient points, used to construct an equation, on the line. Others chose two points from the data that balanced the number of points above and below and used the two points to derive an equation. Still other groups drew a line of best fit and estimated the slope geometrically by building a right triangle on the line, measuring rise and run, and then estimating the value of the y-intercept from the intersection of the line of best fit and the y-axis. Constructing scatterplots, drawing lines of best fit, and finding the equation for these lines required the entire instructional period. Some classes may require more time to complete these complex tasks.",,
50,A Vehicle for Bivariate Data Analysis - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Day 3: Explaining Results,,
51,A Vehicle for Bivariate Data Analysis - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"During the third instructional period, students were asked to complete their third postera verbal explanation of their resultsin preparation for a gallery viewing. Students were asked to use sentences to describe the association that was found in terms of direction, form, and strength. Further, students were asked to identify any clusters and any outliers. If the association appeared linear, groups were asked to present the linear model that they found and explain the meaning of the slope and y-intercept in the context of the study.",,
52,A Vehicle for Bivariate Data Analysis - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Synthesizing the many parts of the investigation proved difficult for many groups. Although most groups were able to make statements about the direction and strength of association, many forgot to identify the form of association. Teachers would do well to remind students that association can be nonlinear in form. Some groups experienced difficulty when making sense of their linear equation in the context of the data. Students were reminded that the x and y of the coordinate plane must be exchanged for their contextualized meaning. This prompt helped students reason about the meaning of the slope and y-intercept in the context from which their data was drawn.",,
53,A Vehicle for Bivariate Data Analysis - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"After having twenty minutes to complete their third and final poster, a jigsaw strategy was used to create viewing committees consisting of one member from each group. These viewing committees rotated among the group posters in a gallery viewing. The member of each viewing committee whose poster was being viewed was asked to summarize their groups work. The other students viewing the work were required to ask at least one question of each presenter. This aspect of the three-day lesson was especially powerful in that it gave students the opportunity to communicate mathematically about many different aspects of the results of their bivariate data analysis. Many questions were posed to presenters about clusters, outliers, and slope. Many viewing committees discussed their hypotheses about why certain studies had lower strength of linear association. For example, one group concluded that fuel economy and torque had only a moderate negative association because other factors, like weight and horsepower, also play a role in determining fuel efficiency. Students posters were hung in the classroom as examples of bivariate analysis. See the collection in figure 3.",,

55,A Vehicle for Bivariate Data Analysis - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,CONNECT THE CLASSROOM  TO REAL-WORLD DATA,,
56,A Vehicle for Bivariate Data Analysis - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"CCSSM has set high expectations for the teaching of statistics and probability to grade 8 students in the area of bivariate quantitative analysis. Rather than an impossible expectation, I would argue that the new standards represent a unique opportunity for mathematics teachers to connect the mathematics of the classroom to real-world data through linear modeling.",,
57,A Vehicle for Bivariate Data Analysis - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Both NCTM and the Common Core have placed a high level of importance on helping students understand the process of data analysis through mathematical modeling in real-world contexts. NCTM advocates for mathematical instruction in which middle-grades students model and solve problems that arise in the real and mathematical worlds, they learn to use variables to represent unknowns and also learn to employ equations, tables, and graphs to represent and analyze relationships (NCTM 2000, p. 71). Likewise, the Common Core (CCSSI 2010) places special importance on modeling through the designation of modeling with mathematics as one of its eight mathematical practices that should be a part of mathematical instruction at all levels. The data set presented here and the accompanying example of a classroom application provide educators with a vehicle whose destination is a richer mathematical understanding of the modeling process through investigating a topic that is well suited to young students on the verge of driving.",,
