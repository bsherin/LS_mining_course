Teaching with Technology  and iBooks Author ,0,mtms2012-12-267a,,
"Cindy Parrott and Ken Holvig quick reads a good idea in a small package mMy eighth-grade students are part  of our district’s pilot program using iPads® in the classroom. As a mathematics teacher, I have found it more difficult than teachers of other subjects to find good classroom-ready apps. When Apple introduced iBooks Author for the iPad in January 2012, I worked with a technology teacher to reinvent a project I had assigned in the past. This new version turned out to be successful beyond our greatest expectations.",1,mtms2012-12-267a,,
"This project asked students to  look at their own cultural identity and select an artifact to explore from a mathematical perspective. A cultural artifact was defined as anything created by people that tells a story about the culture of its creator and users. It can be any object that symbolizes cultural identity, such as food, clothing, photographs, art, games, or music. The item must help demonstrate the importance of culture in one’s life. Once the item was selected, students were asked to research the mathematics behind the artifact, create mathematical problems based on it, make a class presentation, and write a reflec- tion. I decided to incorporate such a project after reading “Addressing Diversity in the Mathematics Classroom with Cultural Artifacts” (Neel 2005) in this journal.",2,mtms2012-12-267a,,

"When iBooks Author was released, I immediately knew that this vehicle would allow me to re-create this project using technology. The app for  iBooks Author is available free on the Mac App Store. It allows anyone to create and publish multitouch electronic books. Apple provides several different templates that each contain a variety of page layouts so users can customize their work. Those who use Pages for word processing will be comfortable with many of the tools and icons in iBooks Author.",6,mtms2012-12-267a,,
"The major difference, and what makes iBooks Author special, is the widget icon. Widgets in the application allow Keynote (Apple’s version of PowerPoint®) presentations and video to be embedded in the pages. Such options as photo galleries, interactive images, three-dimensional animations, ",7,mtms2012-12-267a,,

"The technology teacher in my  school and I promptly experimented with the application so that we could present it to my class. Once I saw its potential, I rewrote the project so that each student could use his or her cultural artifact to create a chapter in a class iBook. After conducting research on their artifact, students were taken to the computer lab and given a brief introduction to iBooks Author. They quickly immersed themselves in the application and were creating pages that were visually stunning by the end of just one class period.",10,mtms2012-12-267a,,
This project asked students to think  critically about something that was culturally important to them and view it through a mathematical lens. The technology allowed students to effectively communicate their mathematical ideas using a new form of interactive media. It enabled them to bring their artifact and the mathematics to life. The end result was much more than a five-minute class presentation. ,11,mtms2012-12-267a,,
"The chapters were compiled in an  electronic class book that students  could keep indefinitely and share with their families. Chapters included common items, but through this assignment, the class and I learned about several other artifacts for the first time.  coMMUnication",12,mtms2012-12-267a,,

"One student wrote about an erhu, a two-stringed Chinese fiddle that ends in a hexagonal prism, which dates back to the Tang dynasty in China. He included an interactive photo gallery with three photographs and a three-dimensional model of a bow, courtesy of Google’s 3D Warehouse. When touched, the photographs become full screen, and the threedimensional model of the bow could be rotated so that it is viewed from all angles. This student also included a Keynote presentation, describing the mathematics of regular hexagons, and a video (see fig. 1). Five multiplechoice review questions were also  included at the end of his chapter.",14,mtms2012-12-267a,,
"Another student with family from Cuba chose a dice game called cubilete and discussed the probability involved in playing the game. An interactive die, which the reader could spin on the page, was included in his chapter. To enlarge the die to allow it to be manipulated in full screen required only a tap. This student was a particularly savvy writer of HTML code; figure 2 shows the widget he created that rolls five dice and lets the reader decide if he or she wishes to keep some dice or choose to roll again. His widget allowed the reader to virtually play the game of cubilete.",15,mtms2012-12-267a,,
"Another student chose the Ishango Bone as his cultural artifact. This item was originally discovered in the ruins of a Central African community that had been destroyed by a volcano. He described how tallies found on the artifact have led scientists to believe that the origin of basic mathematical concepts, such as prime numbers, occurred 25,000 years ago. These basic concepts could have originated in that area of Africa. He incorporated ",16,mtms2012-12-267a,,

"The geometry found in the patterns of batik, a traditional clothdyeing technique used in some parts of Asia and Africa, was explored by yet another student. Her introduction page is shown in figure 4. Her text included detailed mathematical explanations of the geometry, enhanced with interactive photographs, review questions, and a video explanation.  collaBoRation and technology",20,mtms2012-12-267a,,

"Students who worked on a previous version of this project were asked to write a short paper, which only I read, and could share their cultural artifact with the class during a short presentation. Using iBooks Author, students were able to write their chapters for one another and became very curious about the work of their classmates. They read each chapter, interacted with the content, and eagerly took the review quizzes. Students made mathematical connections with items that had personal meaning to their classmates.

"This stunning, multitouch book   allowed each student the opportunity to learn more about his or her classmates and further appreciate his or her own cultural identity. My eighthgrade students embraced the technology, enjoyed their mathematical explorations, and created an outstanding product.",23,mtms2012-12-267a,,
