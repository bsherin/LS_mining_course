It is offered to help you assess and develop your students’ understanding of a particular rational number concept that is critical as students transition into algebra: the connection between the operation a ÷ b and the fraction a/b. The activity sounds simple: Write the fraction that represents how much each person would receive when sharing 9 cookies. It turned out to be anything but simple and provided a huge payout in terms of understanding my students’ rational number sense. ",5,Sharing Cookies: A Case Study

10,Sharing Cookies: A Case Study,"I knew from pretests that most students could add, subtract, multiply, and divide fractions, but they did not know how to simplify complex fractions or explain why the fraction algorithms they were using worked. This situation suggested that my students lacked an understanding of some of the big ideas of rational numbers, particularly multiple interpretations of rational numbers (Barnett-Clarke et al. 2010; Clarke, Roche, and Mitchell 2008). Kieren (1984) identifi ed partitioning as a critical skill for understanding rational numbers.",10,Sharing Cookies: A Case Study
11,Sharing Cookies: A Case Study,"Rational number interpretations  can include part-whole, measure, ratio, quotient, and operator. These are all subconstructs of partitioning (Barnett-Clarke et al. 2010; Behr et al. 1980; Clarke, Roche, and Mitchell 2008; Flores, Samson, and Yanik 2006). Each of these subconstructs uses different cognitive skills (Driscoll 1984), so it is important that students experience all the different forms of interpretation.",11,Sharing Cookies: A Case Study

21,Sharing Cookies: A Case Study,"Thinking about all these goals, the students dove into an activity on sharing cookies among different numbers of people (Curcio and Bezuk 1994). The original activity shared 13 cookies among the members of a family, which employs the quotient interpretation of fractions. To push students to connect the quotient and operator interpretations, I modifi ed the activity so that they would share 9 cookies among 1, 2, 3, . . . , 30 people. Students were asked to make a chart showing the fractional portion that each person would receive. ",21,Sharing Cookies: A Case Study
22,Sharing Cookies: A Case Study,"I anticipated that they might solve this problem in several distinct ways. (See ﬁ g. 1 for examples of sharing 9 cookies among 3 people.) First, I expected that some students would divide the set of 9 cookies into n equal parts (see ﬁ g. 1a). Second, I thought that some students might “deal out” one cookie to each person, dividing leftover cookies into equal parts until everything was shared (see ﬁ g. 1b). (Note that although the representations for these two methods look similar, the thinking involved is substantially different.) I also thought that some students would divide each  cookie into n equal parts, giving 1 part to each person (see ﬁ g. 1c).",22,Sharing Cookies: A Case Study
23,Sharing Cookies: A Case Study,"Finally, I anticipated that some would use the operator interpretation to simply write 9/n to represent the fractional portion each person would receive (see ﬁ g. 1d). Although the fi rst two methods work well for division of whole numbers (i.e., 9 ÷ 3), they do not work easily when you have leftovers, such as 9 ÷ 4, or when the denominator is larger than the numerator, such as in 9 ÷ 30. In these cases, the last two representations are needed (see ﬁ g. 1c and 1d). By asking students to create a table and sharing cookies among 1, 2, 3, . . . , 30 people, I hoped to push them from the fi rst two representations to the last two. This item became homework. I anticipated that it would be an easy assignment for students and that the class would need about 15 minutes the next day to share these four methods in class and anything else they found. Things did not go quite as planned. About 45 minutes after school ended, the fi rst question popped up via Edmodo©, our online communication system. “Can I use a calculator to do this?” I had not anticipated that students would produce decimals; after all, I had emphasized the fractional portion that each person would receive and knew that using decimals would not lead students to the type of thinking that was intended. I tried to redirect student thinking by responding: “Don’t use a calculator; remember I want the fractional portion each person would receive.” ",23,Sharing Cookies: A Case Study

Forewarned from my interactions with multiple students on Edmodo, I was still unprepared for the number of students that relied on the use of division and decimals to fi gure out how many cookies to share. The next day, as table groups discussed their thinking about the problems, I counted only three students who had not immediately used long division. David had numbers randomly written on his paper; Jamie had pages of circles and numbers. Brian used the last strategy from ﬁ gure 1 and wrote every fraction as 9/n. His comment to his group was that making the chart took him more time  than fi lling it in. Even though Brian used the same basic strategy as the rest of his group, the group members did not see the connection between the decimals that they had found from dividing and Brian’s fractions.

27,Sharing Cookies: A Case Study,"Most students had divided all  30 fractions using long division by hand or a calculator.

30,Sharing Cookies: A Case Study,"For example, when sharing 9 cookies among 11 people, one student used long division to obtain “0.818181 and it kept going.” To obtain a fraction, this student explained, “I rounded it to 0.82, so I got 82/100 or 41/50.” By rounding decimals (both repeating and terminating), students’ answers did not come back to 9/n, so they completely missed the connection I wanted them to make. Because so few students had used the representations that would have helped them see the connection between division and fractions, small-group discussion was getting us nowhere.

One student suggested dividing the leftover cookie into 4 equal pieces and giving 1/4 to each person. Students were then able to successfully share 9 cookies among 5 people by making 5 equal groups of 1 cookie and taking the remaining 4 cookies, dividing them into 5 equal  parts, and sharing 4 parts with each person (see ﬁ g. 2).",35,Sharing Cookies: A Case Study

82,Sharing Cookies: A Case Study,"I also consistently emphasized the efficiency of using fractions rather than decimals. For example, when solving an equation like 9x = 126, I emphasized factoring 126 into 9(14), so that the 9s would divide out. When finding the volume of a sphere with radius 3,  π( 3 , figure d we discussed dividing the 3 first so that the problem became 4π(32), or 36π cubic units, rather than making 4/3 into a decimal and then multiplying by 27.",82,Sharing Cookies: A Case Study
83,Sharing Cookies: A Case Study,"Finally, students did not understand that turning a fraction into a decimal, rounding the decimal, and turning it back into a fraction would not yield the same fraction they started with. To address this issue, students worked through discussion problems that focused their attention on fractions versus decimals. Such questions as the following have helped my students understand that it is not always a good idea to convert every fraction into a decimal.",83,Sharing Cookies: A Case Study

85,Sharing Cookies: A Case Study,"I will use this activity again next year, but now I know not to assume that it is a simple activity for students. Rather than assign it for homework, students will work on this problem in the classroom so that they can tap into their peers’ thinking. Before working on the task, we will explore several activities in which students  model fraction situations to give students several visual images they can use in the Cooking-Sharing problem (see Clarke, Roche, and Mitchell 2008; Curcio and Bezuk 1994; and http://illuminations.nctm.org for good examples).

86,Sharing Cookies: A Case Study,"It is easy to assume that students  understand rational number concepts because they can remember the algorithms for operating with fractions. This simple activity showed that even highly capable students may not necessarily have a deep understanding of rational number concepts, a lack that could impact their ability to make sense of algebraic concepts in later classes. Giving students the opportunity to make the connection between the operation a ÷ b and the fraction a/b gave me insight into what my students understood and prevented potential problems later in the course.",86,Sharing Cookies: A Case Study
