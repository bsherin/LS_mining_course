Students are intensely focused on the matter at hand: winning. Gobblet Gobblers, Tic Stac ToeTM, Othello, and Go strategy games are set up at tables, on the floor, and in reading corners. To a casual observer, this might look like a social gathering in school, but it is not recess and not play time. There is an intensity to the reasoning in play. Students are forming conjectures, explaining moves, and justifying their strategies. Students described the scene in this way: “We’re in math class playing games, not playing games in math class.” ",4,"Were in Math Class Playing Games, Not Playing Games in Math Class"
5,"Were in Math Class Playing Games, Not Playing Games in Math Class",These early experiences of reasoning while playing  games of strategy are foundational for future proofs that students will be expected to build using conventionally structured arguments. But how did game  playing in school occur? How can we be sure that mathematical reasoning is going on? We investigated these questions to understand how to improve students’ reasoning. ,5,"Were in Math Class Playing Games, Not Playing Games in Math Class"
6,"Were in Math Class Playing Games, Not Playing Games in Math Class","Knowing that reasoning is a cornerstone of success in mathematics (CCSSI 2010; NCTM 2014), we believed that it was important to focus on logical thinking as a mathematical practice. We chose the context of abstract strategy games because games in this category depend on logical reasoning for players to win. In fact, the games require logic to move from singular moves to effective  strategies. We also wanted students to value reasoning as an integral part of thinking mathematically, which could then be applied across all mathematics content.",6,"Were in Math Class Playing Games, Not Playing Games in Math Class"

10,"Were in Math Class Playing Games, Not Playing Games in Math Class","The creation of the educative environment was not accidental pedagogically. We collaborated with a teacher, Nancy, to explore how commercially available games could support emerging reasoning in her multi-aged grade 5 and 6 class. We chose games that were strategic and contained no element of chance. Players are required to develop and defend effective strategies to win. (See the sidebar on  page 543 for game descriptions.)",10,"Were in Math Class Playing Games, Not Playing Games in Math Class"
11,"Were in Math Class Playing Games, Not Playing Games in Math Class","The desire to determine how to win encouraged students to engage in the Standard for Mathematical Practice (SMP) 3: “Construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others” (CCSSI 2010, p. 6). The games provided opportunities for students to analyze specific moves, make conjectures about those moves in alternate situations, test those moves to convince themselves and others they worked, and generalize toward strategies that required justification and judgment. The veracity of the reasoned arguments was evaluated within the game play to decide on their defensibility.",11,"Were in Math Class Playing Games, Not Playing Games in Math Class"
12,"Were in Math Class Playing Games, Not Playing Games in Math Class","Rather than simply exploring the  games, Nancy set the expectation that expert, strategic players continually refine strategies based on inductive reasoning. Given specific board arrangements, the students then determine weaknesses and strengths of strategies. Owen, one of the students, recognized that as an expert he needed to show that he had “a good chance of winning and a lot of strategies” each time he played. However, we knew that eliciting reasoning would require more than just an engaging context. We also intentionally shifted students’ focus to emphasize the strategic aspects of game play.",12,"Were in Math Class Playing Games, Not Playing Games in Math Class"
13,"Were in Math Class Playing Games, Not Playing Games in Math Class","Even though these are two-player  games, students initially played as partners against another pair of students. The structure was intentional because collaboration and discussion in a social context are integral to the thoughtful construction of reasoning (Graves 2011; Olson 2007). When partnerships became a matter of choice, Nancy reminded the students to “pick a mathematically productive partner—someone who challenges you to think hard and generate new ideas.” As students played alongside each other, they collaboratively investigated strategies and explained their reasons for suggesting particular moves.",13,"Were in Math Class Playing Games, Not Playing Games in Math Class"
14,"Were in Math Class Playing Games, Not Playing Games in Math Class","During game play, the collaboration between students and across opposing pairs was also encouraged through listening to and analyzing strategies being shared. As teachers and researchers, we modeled listening by sitting with groups of students attuned to the explanations given for moves. When we heard compelling reasoning, we wrote down students’ comments to document their mathematical thinking. Nancy explained this as a powerful practice: ",14,"Were in Math Class Playing Games, Not Playing Games in Math Class"
15,"Were in Math Class Playing Games, Not Playing Games in Math Class","We were copying down what they said so that they could see what we privileged as information and got excited about.

And then they started to build on that.",15,"Were in Math Class Playing Games, Not Playing Games in Math Class"
16,"Were in Math Class Playing Games, Not Playing Games in Math Class","While we listened and documented their comments, students realized that we valued their reasoning. In turn, recognizing the value of students’ moves as reasoned play encouraged them to develop more sophisticated reasoning and evaluate justifications.

The offensive gain indicated an important strategy similar to tic tac toe as Floyd accepted Sasha’s reason for her placement of pieces.

26,"Were in Math Class Playing Games, Not Playing Games in Math Class","While students readily engaged in exploring the games to analyze specific moves, we found that to sustain productive mathematical thinking we needed to prompt for reasoning that had led to winning strategies. Building on the instructional practice to “pose purposeful questions” (NCTM 2014, p. 10), we used verbal and written prompts to encourage students to express their reasoning as a second powerful practice.",26,"Were in Math Class Playing Games, Not Playing Games in Math Class"
27,"Were in Math Class Playing Games, Not Playing Games in Math Class","While students were playing the  games, we posed questions aloud. We found that it was helpful to have some questions prepared in advance to elicit emergent reasoning, but to be responsive to how each game unfolded. (See fig. 1 for examples of teacher-posed prompts.) These queries also allowed us to ask follow-up questions immediately to probe for more sophisticated reasoning.",27,"Were in Math Class Playing Games, Not Playing Games in Math Class"
28,"Were in Math Class Playing Games, Not Playing Games in Math Class","Nancy explained that the prepared questions enabled her to “see another question that was forming to do with strategy, like, ‘I noticed you just did this and I’m wondering what the purpose was.’ ” Figure 2 depicts how Kurt’s sophisticated strategy considered several moves in advance like an informal game tree of future moves, including a deductive reasoning structure of an if-then statement.

30,"Were in Math Class Playing Games, Not Playing Games in Math Class","Verbal prompting added richness to students’ reasoning; however, we thought it would be important for students to record their strategies and explain their reasoning with words and drawings. We developed record sheets to promote the idea that students had strategies and reasoning worth recording (see fig. 3’s sample prompts). In fact, in our final class, Nira—a student typically unengaged in class—showed so much pride in her thinking that she insisted that Nancy read her record sheet before leaving class.",30,"Were in Math Class Playing Games, Not Playing Games in Math Class"

We noticed that these students’ analyses of where to start playing led to their decision of beginning in the corner and moving to the middle.

50,"Were in Math Class Playing Games, Not Playing Games in Math Class","When the teacher prompted Alison to explain her defense of a move, it caused Alison to evaluate possible moves based on Patricia’s choices that were not at first apparent. This demonstrated a growing sophistication in reasoning because we found that students just beginning to play Othello had limited visualizations of possible moves. Purposeful prompting led students through a progression of thinking that advanced from the specific to general, from simple explorations to emergent reasoning, and from tentative conjectures to confident justifications.
