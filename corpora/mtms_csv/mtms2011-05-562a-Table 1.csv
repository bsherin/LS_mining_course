"As an educator of middle-level preservice teachers, I look for ways to introduce, explore, and assess students’ understandings of number concepts. I use manipulatives to model both instructional strategies and classroom management issues for these preservice teachers. ",3,mtms2011-05-562a,,

"I have used with middle school students and currently use with preservice teachers is what I call a multiples mat, which is a 12 × 12 times table that has been laminated and cut into horizontal rows. We use it in math class several times during the year. ",6,mtms2011-05-562a,,
"My multiples-mat work was  inspired by a letter to the editor in this journal titled “Fraction Strips” (Horne 1994). The author of the letter had used fraction strips to show the addition and subtraction of fractions. However, the concepts that can be taught with this manipulative are not limited to fractions. While using both paper and craft-stick versions of the manipulative, I found  562  MatheMatics teaching in the Middle school  ●  Vol. 16, No. 9, May 2011  Copyright © 2011 The National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, Inc.  www.nctm.org.

that several other numerical concepts could be explored by my sixth-grade students. The “aha!” moments that preservice teachers experience as we have reviewed and explored numerous common number concepts are similar to those I have experienced with my sixth-grade students.,8,mtms2011-05-562a,,

"After handing out individual envelopes containing the multiples mats, I lead students through a short series of lessons to review mathematical vocabulary (see activity sheet 1). We initially explore patterns within specifi c rows: Numbers in row 2 end in an even number, row 5 alternates with a 5 or 0 in the last-digit place, and numbers in row 10 end in zero. I also ask questions that make students think about the digits located in the units place, the tens place, and so on. In fi gure 1, for example, middle school students easily recognize that the units digit in row 5 alternates  between 5 and 0. Some students will also comment about the tens digit starting with nothing (or 0), then 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, and so on. Verbalizing understanding of simple patterns is an essential step that will eventually lead to creating rules using symbolic notation. ",10,mtms2011-05-562a,,
"Asking students to look at other  rows allows them to review their multiplication tables while investigating patterns. This is beneficial for students who cannot automatically recall their multiplication facts. As students share their discoveries, I informally assess their fact fluency and mental flexibility. ",11,mtms2011-05-562a,,
"Eventually, students construct a complete times table. I encourage them to look for diagonal and vertical patterns. Some students seem to see patterns easily, whereas others need guidance. Using a ruler or long strip of paper helps students block off part of the mat. I ask them to write their observations using as much mathematical vocabulary as possible. ",12,mtms2011-05-562a,,
"It will become obvious if some  students have limited knowledge generalizing about numbers. For example, some students have not experienced what happens when multiplying any number by an even number (the result is always even). Some may also not know that multiplying any number by an odd number results in an alternating pattern of odd and even numbers (see fig. 2). ",13,mtms2011-05-562a,,
"When studying this number  topic, an excellent resource to read to students is Among the Odds and Evens: A Tale of Adventure (Turner 2001). This story addresses simple concepts about numbers that should have been explored in the lower elementary grades. Furthermore, the patterns found in the multiples of 2, 5, and 10 lead to discussions about divisibility patterns. I encourage students to make generalizations and conjectures as they arise from discussions about ",14,mtms2011-05-562a,,

the patterns they see in the multiples mats. Some of their ideas can become very sophisticated.,19,mtms2011-05-562a,,
"Students are often intrigued by the diagonal patterns they discover. Their explanations vary, such as describing the pattern that appears when following the numbers from the top-left square (1) diagonally down to the bottom-right square (144). The number pattern is 1, 4, 9, 16, and so on (see fig. 3). Some students, depending on the grade level and prior explorations, may recognize this pattern as 12, 22, 32, 42, and so on. If not, this perfect visual allows them to see square numbers of the form n2. I have always had students see the pattern of 1, 4, 9, 16 as +3, +5, +7. As one transitions to functions, the preference is for a rule that is applicable in all situations. With sixth graders, however, I initially just want them to gain flexibility in considering how to describe the number patterns.",20,mtms2011-05-562a,,
Fig. 4 Numbers in diagonals from right to left produce a palindrome.,21,mtms2011-05-562a,,
"The diagonal patterns moving in the opposite direction from top right (12) to bottom left (12) differ slightly, depending on whether the diagonal has an odd or even set of numbers (see fig. 4). The numbers appear to be a palindrome, such as 5, 8, 9, 8, 5. Students may describe the differences in the numbers as being odd; as having a pattern of +3, +1, −1, −3; or by relating that a number goes up until it ",22,mtms2011-05-562a,,

"One surprising aspect for my students has been the demonstration of other number operations using the multiples mats. I ask students to pull out the 4, 5, and 9 strips and describe the patterns in these strips (see fig. 5a). Some students will find 4 + 5 = 9,  8 + 10 = 18, 12 + 15 = 27, and so on.  I feign surprise and tell them to continue looking for patterns, since the manipulative is not an addition table. They then tell me that this manipulative could help them with subtraction facts. ",28,mtms2011-05-562a,,
"Sure enough, several students move the strips (see fig. 5b) and discover that 9 – 5 = 4 or 9 – 4 = 5. Middle-level preservice and in- service teachers have also been surprised by this discovery. The ensuing discussion is very interesting. Students start validating which three strips can be added or subtracted and discover that multiple pairs of strips make up the same third strip, such as the 1 and 6, 2 and 5, and 3 and 4—all equaling the 7 strip. ",29,mtms2011-05-562a,,
"This discovery provides an opportunity to discuss multiples, the distributive property, and order of operations. Using the students’ prior discoveries of 4 + 5 = 9, 8 + 10 = 18, and 12 + 15 = 27, one can rewrite the problems to demonstrate that 3(4) + 3(5) = 3(9) or 3(4 + 5) = 27. I emphasize that the number outside the parentheses, in this example the 3, represents a specific location on the strip. The notation of 3(4) is the third number from the left on the 4 strip, or 12, which is a multiple of 4. ",30,mtms2011-05-562a,,

"If one uses the same location on each strip, the same multiple, then you can add or subtract with the strips. I also show students subtraction using the distributive property, such as  3(9) – 3(5) = 3(4) or 3(9 − 5) = 3(4).",32,mtms2011-05-562a,,
"Some students will create models, such as that in fi gure 6. This leads to further conjectures as to whether any  two strips can be added to produce a third and possibly unknown strip. The times table for 19 is a favorite of mine to discuss with students. After examining the pattern, many students memorize at least 19 multiples of 10. Most students quickly see that the units place value is decreasing by one and that the tens, or the number formed by the hundreds and tens, is increasing by two. ",33,mtms2011-05-562a,,

"Students can also use the strips to add and subtract fractions. For example, when adding 5/6 and 3/8, students would use the 5 and 6 strips and the 3 and 8 strips (see fi g. 8).

"I have found that when students  write out the solutions for all the denominators that the two fractions have in common, they better understand the importance of the lowest common denominator. They also get additional practice in simplifying fractions. Since a student can use a multiples mat to fi nd common denominators, the manipulative can also be used to compare and order fractions.

"A fl orist sells roses in only three colors: red, pink, and yellow. The roses are bought in the ratio of 5 to 4 to 6. If the store has received a shipment of 360 roses, how many are pink?",45,mtms2011-05-562a,,
"Students can pull the 5, 4, and 6 strip and add the total number of roses until 360 is found (see fi g. 9). In this instance, the student could use the column that totals to 180, then double the number or roses. This would mean  the fl orist received 120 red, 96 pink, and 144 yellow roses, resulting in a fi nal answer of 96 pink roses. ",46,mtms2011-05-562a,,

"A multiples mat can also be used to generate lists of numbers from which students create simple rules. However, there are some limitations as to the functions that can be created. The vertical orientation becomes preferable for such problems. Most students will not have diffi culty with simple relationships, such as f(x) = 3x, which can be demonstrated with the 1 and 3 strips. However, some relationships can be demonstrated that help students gain an understanding of the concept of a constant (see fi g. 10). Slightly offset the strips that model f(x) = 3x + 3 and f(x) = 3x − 3. Although the strips demonstrate only simple functional relationships, such rudimentary explorations are important for middle-level students.  conclUding thoUghts",48,mtms2011-05-562a,,
"Incorporating multiples mats during the teaching or review of number concepts is relatively simple, because middle-level students are familiar with multiplication charts and often use them regularly when calculating. I have found this manipulative to be especially helpful when working with special needs students and those who struggle to memorize math facts. Feel free to share this manipulative with your special education teachers, instructional aides, parents, or colleagues. ",49,mtms2011-05-562a,,
