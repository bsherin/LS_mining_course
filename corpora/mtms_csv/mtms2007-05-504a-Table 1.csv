"I HAvE bEEN A MATHEMATICS TEACHEr AND EDuCATOr THrOuGHOuT ALL fOur  publications of the Standards documents (NCTM 1991, 1995, 1989, and 2000). Over the years, while concentrating on improving various aspects of my teaching, specifically, improving my students’ ability to problem solve, I have been perplexed to see students pick numbers out of a problem and perform an operation with no regard for the context. To address this issue by teaching problem-solving lessons made me realize  that  I  did  not  know  the  difference  between  students  solving  a  problem  and actual problem solving. A lesson beginning with a problem or task does not make it a problem-solving lesson, especially when students would inevitably solve it the way I had intended. Instead of problem solving, my students were trying to figure out what I was thinking. To prevent the temptation of leading students in this way of thinking required careful planning of problem-solving lessons. ",4,mtms2007-05-504a,,

"son plans are typically presented in an outline form; a topic is presented and key points are bulleted. The key  points  primarily  address  definitions  and  formulas.  Japanese  lesson  plans  are  much  more  detailed. They provide a context for the current lesson within previous and subsequent lessons as well as probing questions,  possible  student  responses  to  the  questions,  and  follow-up  suggestions  that  are  based  on student  responses.  Stigler,  fernandez,  and  Yoshida found that teaching could be improved by using a detailed lesson plan format. I adapted a similar format for  my  problem-solving  lessons,  with  components intended  to  provide  a  framework  for  my  own  metacognitive thinking. The framework is not scripted but includes sequenced learning activities; mathematical content  questions;  suggestions  for  possible  student responses, correct and incorrect; misconceptions that students may have; and potential guidance that can be provided,  based  on  student  understanding.  The  lesson plans revolve around one problem. The specific questions presented are to help students understand the problem and get started solving it. Content-pedagogy  questions  for  stimulating  teacher-student  and student-student interactions are also included. ",7,mtms2007-05-504a,,
"Anticipating  responses  to  the  questions  prevents me from influencing my students toward a particular path. Trying to anticipate what a student might think is quite a challenge. To aid the planning, I presented the same problem to several different mathematics methods classes comprising preservice elementary school and middle school education majors. I knew that I had to remain open and flexible to their thinking and reasoning so as to plan for students’ responses. by continually revising my lesson plan based on new or different points and views from the students and reflecting each time I presented the problem forced me to consciously think about the problem-solving experience. This process allowed me to think ahead about how to facilitate students’ understanding of the problems. ",8,mtms2007-05-504a,,
"To help my preservice teachers write a lesson plan using this format, they were asked to choose a problem  for  their  upper-elementary  and  middle  school practicum  students  to  solve.

This gave each preservice teacher a variety of methods to consider when trying to anticipate students’ thinking when writing their lesson plans. ",9,mtms2007-05-504a,,

The entire class is shown the first three arrangements  of  a  growing  pattern,  illustrated  in  figure  1. Students are asked to picture and then describe what the 4th arrangement will look like without building or drawing it. Students differ in their descriptions of how four cubes are added to the third figure to produce the 4th. Some students add four cubes horizontally to form a fourth row (fig. 2a); some add four cubes vertically to form a fourth column (fig. 2b); and some add four cubes diagonally to form an additional staircase (fig. 2c). I then ask them to build the 4th figure, directing their  attention  to  the  critical  features  of  the  pattern, such as the number of cubes in each arrangement and the construction from one arrangement to the next.

"Table 3 contains possible questions that are asked during this phase of the lesson, along with my reason for  planning  each  particular  question.  for  example, one group might add additional cubes to a given staircase arrangement to form a square (referring to the front face of the cubes). Although students might know how to determine the area of the square by multiplying the length of two sides, they might not know how to proceed. I begin questioning, based on what they have done so far, and must recognize if their struggles seem to get them nowhere. for example, if one group is sitting completely perplexed, I may ask if the staircase resembles a certain shape. Students often reply that the staircase resembles a triangle. This question will give them a place to start. for example, one group may reason that the 5th arrangement has 15 cubes, so the 50th arrangement must have 10 times that number, or 150. for this misconception, I would ask students to consider the 50th arrangement of blocks. How many cubes are in the last four columns? (They add 47 + 48 + 49 + 50, which equals 194.) Asking this question helps them address the reasonableness of their method. ",85,mtms2007-05-504a,,

Although the next example also demonstrates even-numbered arrangements, the nature of the explanation shows how the number of cubes in an odd-numbered arrangement can be determined using similar thinking of combining columns. They represented  their  thinking  using  arrangement  6. referring to figure  7a,  they took away the largest column x of 6 cubes and left it alone. The remaining number of columns they now have is x – 1, or 6 – 1 = 5, columns.

"A  CLEAr  EMPHASIS  ON  STuDENTS’  THINkING  IS critical to lesson planning. In this experience, I identified a problem, but the lesson revolved around the ideas that the students generated through their own investigations. The problem could be approached in more  than  one  way,  and  I  was  prepared  for  different approaches (both correct and incorrect), which enabled me to orchestrate the work of the students without taking over the process of thinking for them. I do not write detailed plans of this extent for all of my lessons, but when a particular problem or task lends itself to more than one strategy or method, this form  of  planning  helps  me  prepare  for  crucial  ele- ments. before learning to plan for student thinking, all the methods and strategies my students shared were the same because they were mirroring my solution strategy.  by  carefully  choosing  problems,  anticipating students’ thinking and questions, and preparing a course of action, I am able to use problem solving to further my mathematical goals for the class.
