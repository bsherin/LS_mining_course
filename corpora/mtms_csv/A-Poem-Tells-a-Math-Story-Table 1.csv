2,A Poem Tells a Math Story,"I wanted to share an idea, and the results, from a cross-curricular activity that the language arts teacher and I, the middle school math teacher, tried last year. During April, in honor of poetry month, I began each class by reading a poem related to math. I was hard pressed to find many good poems online for this subject area. ",2,A Poem Tells a Math Story
3,A Poem Tells a Math Story,"In the last week of April, I asked the students to write a poem about math. The assignment was openended; the subject matter could be anything related to math, and it had to follow one of the poetry formats that students were learning about in language arts. My hope was to compile fun poems to read the next year during April. ",3,A Poem Tells a Math Story
4,A Poem Tells a Math Story,"The assignment was a great suc- cess. The students were speaking about it all week. They were sharing their poems and very excited to hear them. One poem stood out, written by Olivia, an eighth-grade female student (see fig. 1). ",4,A Poem Tells a Math Story

39,A Poem Tells a Math Story,"Mathematicians have long searched for a function f(n) that will always produce a prime number. In the interesting article “Generalizing and Skepticism: Bringing Research to Practice” by David A. Yopp and Jacob L. Ellsworth (December 2016/January 2017, pp. 284–92), the authors use the expression n2 + n + 41, which Euler proposed as an expression for creating prime numbers. When using n = 1, 2, 3, . . . , this expression will  produce a prime number for every natural number value of n until  n = 40. However, f(40) = 1681 = 412.",39,A Poem Tells a Math Story
40,A Poem Tells a Math Story,"Although I know that quadratic  functions of the form f(n) = n2 + n + k do not always create prime numbers, I was still curious about it. So I looked at the function f(n) = n2 + n + k, where n is a natural number, and considered possible natural number values for k. I investigated values of k that are even, odd and composite, and prime. ",40,A Poem Tells a Math Story
41,A Poem Tells a Math Story,"First, I considered even values for  k. Look at the first two terms; n2 + n = n(n + 1) is always the product of one even number and one odd number and so is always even. So when an even value for k is added to n2 + n, f(n) is even and composite. ",41,A Poem Tells a Math Story
42,A Poem Tells a Math Story,"Then I thought about odd, composite values for k. If k is composite, then k = a × b, where a and b are natural numbers. So: f(n) = n2 + n + k = n2 + n + a × b f(a) = a2 + a + a × b = a(a + 1 + b)",42,A Poem Tells a Math Story
43,A Poem Tells a Math Story,"So when k is a composite number, f(n)  will be composite when n is a factor of k.",43,A Poem Tells a Math Story
44,A Poem Tells a Math Story,"Next, I investigated prime number values for k. Picking a number at random, I decided to consider what happens when k = 11. Substituting consecutive natural numbers in for n, I found that f(n) = n2 + n + 11 produced prime numbers for n = 0 through n = 9. But when n = 10, f(n) is the composite number 121. ",44,A Poem Tells a Math Story
45,A Poem Tells a Math Story,"Noticing that composite numbers  and square numbers for both f(n) = n2 + n + 11 and f(n) = n2 + n + 41 occurred when n = k – 1, I decided to  explore that situation: f(k – 1) = (k – 1) 2 + (k – 1) + k = k2, a composite and square number. So f(n) = n2 + n + k will never produce prime numbers beyond n = k − 2. ",45,A Poem Tells a Math Story
46,A Poem Tells a Math Story,"In conclusion, no expression in the  form of n2 + n + k, with k a natural number, will create a prime number for all natural number values of n.",46,A Poem Tells a Math Story
