"John e. hammett iii, jhammett@spc.edu, teaches introductory- and intermediate-level mathematics, statistics, and education courses at Saint Peter’s College in Jersey City, NJ 07306. His professional development interests include mathematical poetry and other forms of recreational mathematics; he enjoys sharing techniques for writing to learn mathematics (e.g., poem problems) with workshop participants at NCTM conferences across the country.

"(as a salute to the spirit of recreational mathematics, this short-story-like dramatization is fictional; the ideas, poetry examples, quotes, and references contained within it, however, are not.) aAs Mrs. Kim balances her coffee  cup on her manila folder filled with student papers and pushes her shoulder-strapped purse out of the way, she searches her overstuffed briefcase for her lanyard of classroom keys. Her mind, however, is already drifting back to the previous day’s events when her middle school class had been energized by an exhilarating visit from a dynamic college professor who writes poetry. In response to the visit, her students enthusiastically composed the poetry contained within the folder she is holding.",5,mtms2007-11-195a,,
"Before peeking into Mrs. Kim’s collection of student work, however, consider this one point of clarification. What makes this situation so unusual is the specialty of the teacher: She isn’t a language arts educator at her middle school; she is a certified mathematics specialist. In all truthfulness, the scholar who spoke with Mrs. Kim’s class is not a creative writing instructor either but a recreational mathematician.",6,mtms2007-11-195a,,

"How did this interest in mathematics poems happen for Mrs. Kim? This middle school mathematics teacher had not heard of recreational mathematicians before attending a regional NCTM conference. She was closed out of a session on pentominoes; since that workshop was filled beyond capacity, Mrs. Kim had to scramble to find another session to occupy her suddenly free hour. She closed her eyes and plunked her manicured pointer finger on the page in the conference program booklet that listed sessions during the current time slot. She landed on one session titled “Recreational Mathematics: Turning the Classroom into an Intellectual Playground.”",21,mtms2007-11-195a,,
"She squinted, making sure she was  reading the title correctly. She was.",22,mtms2007-11-195a,,
"What in the world was the session  about, she wondered? She paused, lost in thought, partly intrigued yet mostly confused. She was jostled back to reality when another displaced refugee from the closed-out session on pentominoes brushed past her in the convention center hallway, aware that she had just moments before the next session started. Having pledged to herself that she would attend a full slate of programs, and a glance at her watch reconfirmed she was running out of time, she immediately darted into this session on recreational mathematics without any further deliberation.",23,mtms2007-11-195a,,
"As her substitute session started, ",24,mtms2007-11-195a,,
"Mrs. Kim distracted herself from her own disappointment by taking copious notes on recreational mathematics. That way, she figured, at least she would not be bored, even if the session was not of special interest to her. It was not long, however, before she forgot all about the manipulatives and became enamored with the theme. Mrs. Kim jotted down bits and pieces of inspirational quotes, literary reviews, even the occasional lighthearted yet informative witticisms shared with the enrapt audience by the engaging speaker.",25,mtms2007-11-195a,,
"For example, someone named ",26,mtms2007-11-195a,,
"Samuel Jones (1932) once said that mathematical recreations were “a form of mental diversion,” as well as, in the language of his era, “a mental tonic for eliminating the ‘sleepy brain’ by sweeping away the cobwebs.” Mrs. Kim certainly appreciated the metaphors, since an intellectual spring cleaning in her classroom was long overdue, and she could recall far too many occasions when sleepy brained students drifted away from her various mathematics lessons, despite her most valiant efforts to keep her class focused.",27,mtms2007-11-195a,,
"An extended definition of mathematical recreation by Martin Gardner captured Mrs. Kim’s imagination during the session, particularly because the presenter profusely praised him as arguably the greatest contributor to this subfield of mathematics. The description by Gardner (1979) read as follows:",28,mtms2007-11-195a,,
"One can define “mathematical games” or “recreational mathematics” by saying it is any kind of mathematics with a strong play element, but this is to say little, because “play,” “recreation,” and “game” are roughly synonymous. In the end one has to fall back on such dodges as defining poetry as what poets write. . . . Recreational math is the kind of math that recreational mathematicians enjoy. (p. xi) ",29,mtms2007-11-195a,,
"Although I cannot define a mathematical game any better than I can a poem, I do maintain that, whatever it is, it is the best [italics added] way to capture the interest of young people in teaching mathematics. A good mathematical puzzle, paradox, or magic trick can stimulate a child’s imagination much faster than a practical application (especially if the application is remote from the child’s experience) . . . . (p. xi) ",30,mtms2007-11-195a,,
"The perspectives of another author, Bakst (1954), caught her attention as she sat listening to the speaker share more quotations about this intriguing subfield of mathematics:",31,mtms2007-11-195a,,
"Mathematical recreation . . . is a mathematical approach to a situation which involves the curious, the strange, the unusual, and often the seemingly impossible. Mathematical recreation may be thought of as permitting mathematics to let down its hair. This, however, does not mean that mathematical principles are sacrificed. Such principles are meticulously preserved, although they are simplified. Thus, the bite, which frightens most, is painlessly removed. (p. v) ",32,mtms2007-11-195a,,
"From the conference, Mrs. Kim brought back to her classroom the premise that poems, puzzles, riddles, raps, and rhymes belong in mathematics class. She left the session with lots of ideas but decided she wanted to experiment with mathematics poems first. Mrs. Kim was intrigued by the assignment advocated by Keller and Davidson (2001) in which students created poems around mathematical terms. She was especially appreciative of the gender-themed poem titled, “Women Mathematicians,” by the poet Hyman Gabai (1991), published in the aptly titled Journal of Recreational Mathematics, to which the poet was a frequent contributor; perhaps the girls  in her class could write about applying mathematics in some future career. She was fascinated by the concept of a poem problem (Hammett 2000, 2003), or story problem set to verse. She especially enjoyed the ones that read like puzzles or riddles. She realized she had known some of these poems most of her life, such as the nursery rhyme about the trip to St. Ives and the famous poem by Benjamin Banneker, “The Puzzle of the Cooper and the Vinter” (e.g., Eves 1971; Mahoney 2003).",33,mtms2007-11-195a,,
"She had also heard a number of  suggestions from those in attendance at the session. For instance, her students could write their own mathematics-themed lyrics to popular songs, television theme songs, advertising jingles, or holiday carols. As another example, she could have them compose poems as a form of pretest review by addressing current mathematics concepts and skills. Furthermore, although the professor had mentioned that Curcio, Zarnowski, and Vigliarolo (1995) described the successful integration of poetry into the elementary school mathematics curricula, incorporating poems into the middle school mathematics curricula seemed novel to Mrs. Kim, and she was ready for such a trail-blazing challenge.",34,mtms2007-11-195a,,
"Mrs. Kim learned more at that  conference about recreational mathematics in general and mathematics poems in particular than she might ever have imagined. She found out that it was a pastime and a passion. Most important, she found some unconventional ways for her middle school students to connect with their mathematics. Although she realized that mathematical poetry was just one avenue along which her students could express their own ideas within the subfield of recreational mathematics, she preferred poems to some of the other equally intriguing options, such as riddles and puzzles. That is why her middle school students now ",35,mtms2007-11-195a,,

"As she mentally rewinds through yesterday’s activities, Mrs. Kim realizes that such poetic compositions are the result of the professor simply asking students and teachers alike to tap into whatever inspires them creatively and piques their curiosity, but to do so within the context of mathematics education. She now knows that recreational mathematics can indeed be a key tool that she can use with her students to foster greater interest and aptitude in mathematics.",60,mtms2007-11-195a,,
"Keys! She remembers now. They  are in her purse, not her briefcase. Mrs. Kim reaches into her handbag, finds them, and unlocks the door to her classroom. She then moves quickly to her desk, sets the coffee cup down, and opens the manila folder. The creativity contained within the lines of the papers inside is almost palpable.",61,mtms2007-11-195a,,
"As she rereads her students’ poetry, a smile crosses her face. One of the poems she reads at her desk this morning was written as a group effort by four of her middle school students, Brendan, Brian, Jason, and Matt. They collectively composed the poem problem in figure 1 about a topic the four of them love: major league baseball sluggers. The teacher then reads a poem problem written by one of the boys’ classmates, Bryan. He mentioned his favorite basketball player, Kobe Bryant, in his verse about a fictitious basketball game. See figure 2.",62,mtms2007-11-195a,,
"“They get it! They really do,” she tells herself. And soon others will know they have gotten the idea, as well. Mrs. Kim is already scanning her desktop calendar so she can schedule what she will call “a recital of mathematical pastimes and curiosities” (Agostini 1980), borrowing and adapting a phrase she heard at the conference. Mrs. Kim got permission from the principal to have her students make a schoolwide presentation, enabling— better yet, empowering—her students to share their creative accomplishments, the poem problems they have carefully crafted and solved themselves, with their schoolmates, their other teachers, their parents, and ultimately the world.",63,mtms2007-11-195a,,
Also in Mrs. Kim’s folder is the  following checklist of suggested strategies and helpful hints that she will use when incorporating this form of recreational mathematics—poetry— into the teaching and learning she fosters in her classroom. She culled these instructional ideas from the   anecdotal testimony that was shared at the conference session she attended:  •  Make the composition of mathematics poems a school-year-long project by having your students compose poems at least once each marking period or term.,64,mtms2007-11-195a,,
"•  Split the class into small groups  for these creative writing projects. Whenever possible, include students with differing aptitudes and interests on the same team of approximately four students (e.g., an avid creative writer paired with a diligent quantitative problem solver). Even students who view writing as a challenge or those who are not native speakers of English can and should contribute to the team experience and the finished product: a mathematics poem.",65,mtms2007-11-195a,,
"•  Allot some class time to the ef- fort; although students should be permitted to polish their poems at home, expecting a first draft during a single class period is reasonable. The examples cited here were all accomplished in one sitting.",66,mtms2007-11-195a,,
"•  Provide models of mathematics poems, and share examples. Have students read aloud some mathematics poems relevant to current mathematics topics or activities during class.",67,mtms2007-11-195a,,
"•  Write along with your students;  whenever they draft a poem, write one yourself.",68,mtms2007-11-195a,,
"•  Encourage students to craft their poems around topics they know well and enjoy discussing among themselves (e.g., sports, television, movies, music, and favorite foods).",69,mtms2007-11-195a,,
"•  Team with a teacher whose specialty or interest is language arts, either as a personal mentor if you are not as well versed (pardon the pun) in poetry as you would like, or for joint, cross-curricular projects for your students. Why not have students work on their mathematics poems in language arts class? •  Expect a little chaotic and exuberant discussion, perhaps even some frivolity, in the classroom as your students brainstorm, teasing out ideas for their poems. These activities can foster unexpected lightheartedness and laughter.",70,mtms2007-11-195a,,
"•  Share compositions proudly with classmates and parents, and pass them along as a legacy to subsequent classes.",71,mtms2007-11-195a,,
"Mrs. Kim remembers what a couple  of her students said at the end of the writing activity yesterday. Eleven-yearold Jason succinctly noted that a mathematics poem “is more fun [than a regular story problem], and it rhymes!” Eleven-year-old Bryan agreed, saying that the mathematics poems were “pretty cool.” He also said, “What’s fun is that you write something [like a mathematics word problem], and then you . . . rhyme it.” She knew that she could not have said it better herself.",72,mtms2007-11-195a,,
"The first morning bell rings. Knowing that her students will arrive shortly, she takes some final moments alone to reflect: She is indeed satisfied with her decision to bring recreational mathematics, in the form of mathematics poems, into her classroom. Mrs. Kim stands up to greet her first group of students but then stops. She has one last tiny chore to complete before she invites the students approaching her classroom into a world of mathematical haiku: She tacks the following poem, written by the professor, on her classroom bulletin board, along with some of her student’s poetry.",73,mtms2007-11-195a,,
