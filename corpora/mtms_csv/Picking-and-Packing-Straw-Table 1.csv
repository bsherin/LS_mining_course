0,Picking and Packing Strawberries - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"On Rhonda’s family farm, the workers picked 5/12 of the strawberries in the first week. These strawberries were put in 10 crates, and 20 kg were leftover. The crates were sent off to the supermarket, and the other 20 kg were sold at the family’s fruit stand. During the second week, the crew picked the remaining strawberries and placed them in  15 crates. How many kilograms of strawberries did the  family’s crew pick during those two weeks?",,

7,Picking and Packing Strawberries - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Typically, younger students attempted to use one of the first three methods, and older students preferred to use the last strategy. This outcome is not unexpected because most sixth or seventh graders have not yet been exposed to solving simultaneous equations through algebraic techniques.",,
8,Picking and Packing Strawberries - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Although guess and check was attempted by a number of younger students, it was a laborious process, and many who began using this method abandoned it after several failed trials. Others, realizing that the number of kilograms per case had to be more than 20, started with larger values for the number per case and were slightly more successful.",,
9,Picking and Packing Strawberries - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"None of the students who attempted to set up proportions to solve the problem were successful because every submission of this type illustrated the setting up of proportions between the fractional parts and the number of cases without incorporating the 20 kg leftover in the first week. If the students would have used other proportional reasoning strategies, rather than just setting up proportions, they may have been more successful.",,
10,Picking and Packing Strawberries - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"For example, Abbey, a student in Michelle Brummet’s seventh-grade class, determined what fraction of the total strawberries was in each crate (see fig. 1) by dividing 7/12 by 15 to get 7/180. She then used that fraction, in combination with her equation for 5/12 of the total being  10 crates plus 20 kg, to determine that the 20 kg was 1/36 of the total number of strawberries. This led her to a total of 720 kg being produced.",,
11,Picking and Packing Strawberries - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
12,Picking and Packing Strawberries - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"It is interesting to note that, like Abbey, very few students ever refer to what is the whole number for 5/12 or 7/12, leading to some strange equations, such as",,
13,Picking and Packing Strawberries - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,5/12 = 10 crates + 20 kg.,,
14,Picking and Packing Strawberries - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"However, most students who used this type of notation as well as unit rate strategies kept track of the appropriate meaning of their fractions as they completed their work. For example, Camila, a sixth grader in Walter Stark’s class, did this as she used the unit rate concept to determine what 1/12 of the total would equal (see fig. 2). She began with 5/12, reasoned down to 1/12, then built back up to 7/12. She then had two expressions for 7/12 and knew that they had to be equal. In this manner, she determined that a single crate had to contain 28 kg and used that number to determine the total kilograms produced in the two weeks.",,
15,Picking and Packing Strawberries - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
16,Picking and Packing Strawberries - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Some students recognized the given information as two equations and two unknowns and solved simultaneous equations. Generally, one variable referred to the number of kilograms per crate and the other variable was the total amount of strawberries produced. Briley, a student in Kathy Strunk’s eighth-grade algebra class, used this technique (see fig. 3).",,
17,Picking and Packing Strawberries - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
18,Picking and Packing Strawberries - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Although this situation got a bit messy for some students, Briley handled it well. It is interesting to note that often the use of formal algebraic methods resulted in longer and more complex solution methods or procedures than those needed by students who used unit rate methods.",,
19,Picking and Packing Strawberries - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,REFLECTING ON THE TASK,,
20,Picking and Packing Strawberries - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,We believe that we have provided a challenging task that could be approached in a variety of ways and that presented opportunities for whole-class discussions about key mathematical concepts at a variety  of levels.,,
21,Picking and Packing Strawberries - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"However, none of the students chose to draw a diagram, which we thought would make the problem accessible to even the youngest of sixth graders, especially because fraction concepts are emphasized in the third and fourth grades. The key was to determine the whole (the number of kilograms picked in two weeks), given information on parts. We include a sample drawing in figure 4, showing the whole cut into twelfths that we created to show this solution strategy.",,
22,Picking and Packing Strawberries - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
23,Picking and Packing Strawberries - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"If we distribute the 10 crates and 20 kg among the 5 yellow parts, we find that each part is 2 crates and  4 kg. Distributing the 15 crates over the 7 green parts means that each part is 2 1/7 crates. Each 1/12  must represent the same amount,  so 2 crates 4 kg and 2 1/7 crates represent the same amount (1/12). Therefore, 4 kg is equal to 1/7 crates, and a crate is equal to 4 kg × 7, or  28 kg.",,
24,Picking and Packing Strawberries - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"During the two weeks, 25 crates were picked, each holding 28 kg, so 700 kg were picked plus the 20 extra kg from the first week for a grand total of 720 kg of strawberries picked during the 2 weeks. This is analogous to the unit rate method that explored how much 1/12 is, based on 5/12, then using it to calculate 7/12. However, it is represented pictorially to help younger students visualize the situation more clearly.",,
25,Picking and Packing Strawberries - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Without teachers who are willing to share their use of the task and their students’ work with MTMS readers, we would not be able to  provide the readers with actual samples of middle school student strategies and work that provides insight into the thinking of middle school students.",,
