0,Exponentiation_ A New Basic_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"For centuries, the basic operations of school mathematics have been identified as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Notably, these operations are â€œbasic,â€ not because they are foundational to mathematics knowledge, but because they were vital to a newly industrialized and market-driven economy several hundred years ago.",,
1,Exponentiation_ A New Basic_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"It is easy to see why computational competence would be useful to a citizen of that era and to ours, as well. If anything, the need has been amplified in our number-dense world. However, it is not clear that these four operations are a sufficient set of basics today, given that some of the most pressing issues, such as population growth, greenhouse gases, ocean acidification, species decline, cultural change, debt increases,  and so on, have strongly exponential characters. Prompted by this thought, I wondered how I might structure a brief unit on exponentiation that would support studentsâ€™ understandings of the concept as a useful interpretive tool, rather than merely an opportunity for additional calculations or a study of symbolic manipulations.",,
2,Exponentiation_ A New Basic_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"As it is currently represented in textbooks, mathclassrooms, and many programs of study, exponentiation appears to be an exemplar of questionable educational practice. Curriculum guides and teacher resources tend to frame the topic almost entirely in symbolic terms and to focus on a single interpretation of the concept, namely, as repeated multiplication. For example, ninth-grade learning outcomes in the province of Alberta, Canada, are stated as follows:",,

9,Exponentiation_ A New Basic_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In the approved classroom resources, the pedagogical sequence is the reverse of conventional wisdom. The content in math textbooks begins with abstract and symbolic manipulations, moves to applications (e.g., the rice-doubling question, the Richter scale, half lives, compound interest), and ignores personal experience.",,
10,Exponentiation_ A New Basic_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"To avoid the curricular emphasis on symbolic manipulations, I elected to work with eighth-grade rather than ninth-grade students. The host teacher generously offered a week of class time. The outline of lesson topics for that week is presented in table 1.",,

12,Exponentiation_ A New Basic_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,MONDAY,,
13,Exponentiation_ A New Basic_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The unitâ€™s opening task was an invitation to create images of exponential change. I began with a simple illustration of sequential doubling, drawn on a whiteboard grid. As illustrated in figure 1, I first darkened the edges of a single square, then expanded to a rectangle of 2 squares, then 4, and then 8. Students were invited to copy and extend the image in their grid-paper notebooks, after which I led them through the first few entries of a summary T-table that linked â€œstepâ€ (in the doubling process) to â€œcountâ€ (of squares in the enclosed region at that step). Students copied and extended the table. Finally, I began a â€œtranslationâ€ of the information from the T-table into a list of â€œpowers of 2â€ and instructed students to extend the list.",,
14,Exponentiation_ A New Basic_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
15,Exponentiation_ A New Basic_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Students were then tasked with creating similar images for bases of 3 to 9 and were required to use the same format to record steps, counts, and powers. A few of the results are represented in figure 2.",,
16,Exponentiation_ A New Basic_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
17,Exponentiation_ A New Basic_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"It is important to note that as an established part of the classroom culture, these students had continuous access to the Internet. Many of their drawings were thus influenced by results of searching for images of â€œexponential growth,â€ â€œpowers of 2,â€ and related terms. These searches also elicited other visual forms associated with exponentiation, including growth curves, logarithmic spirals, base 10 blocks, and fractals. These additional images triggered ideas for a few students, who then created dynamic representations of exponential growth by using sequences of slides in PowerPointÂ®.",,
18,Exponentiation_ A New Basic_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,TUESDAY,,
19,Exponentiation_ A New Basic_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"On our second day, students were asked to compare exponentiation with addition and multiplication.",,
20,Exponentiation_ A New Basic_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Earlier in the school year, as part of an ongoing study of patterns and relationships, the class had created poster-size addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division tables on xy-coordinate grids. On these charts, values on the x-axis served, respectively, as augend, subtrahend, multiplier, and dividend; values on the y-axis served as addend, minuend, multiplicand, and divisor; and corresponding positions on the grid were locations for sums, differences, products, and quotients. Figure 3 presents small portions of these grids.",,
21,Exponentiation_ A New Basic_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
22,Exponentiation_ A New Basic_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In the earlier unit, these visuals proved to be powerful tools for noticing patterns and, in the process, interpreting identity elements, commutativity, and other concepts and properties. I imagined that a chart for exponentiation might serve similar purposes and began the second class with the construction of an exponentiation grid spanning values of â€“10 to +10 on both axes, that is, covering the range of â€“10â€“10 to 1010.",,
23,Exponentiation_ A New Basic_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Two bits of instruction were needed to set up this task. First, students had to appreciate the meaning of negative exponents. I framed the discussion by returning to the images of exponential growth from the previous day and asking what they might look like if we went smaller rather than larger. Starting with the image presented in figure 1, I asked students to come to the board and show what would happen on the diagram, in the T-table, and with the list of â€œpowers of 2â€ if we â€œhalvedâ€ rather than â€œdoubled.â€",,
24,Exponentiation_ A New Basic_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Throughout this discussion, I advised that calculated values be expressed as common fractions rather than decimal fractions to highlight the relationships among powers, that is, to make the relationship between xy and x-y more obvious. Students were then instructed to extend their T-tables and lists of powers from the previous day in a similar manner.",,
25,Exponentiation_ A New Basic_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"From there, it was a small step to creating the exponentiation grid. With calculators permitted and the work distributed across small groups, the grid was assembled quickly. Results were written on precut pieces of masking tape, which were then stuck to a prepared grid. A core portion of the exponentiation table is presented in figure 4.",,
26,Exponentiation_ A New Basic_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
27,Exponentiation_ A New Basic_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The analysis of the result began with the first quadrant. Posted nearby were the directions to compare its patterns with those in the addition and multiplication grids. Three observations were immediately noted. First, students remarked on the â€œsteeper and crazy-steeperâ€ increases in values as one moves away from the origin, contrasted with the â€œflatteningâ€ feel of the addition grid and the â€œgentler risingâ€ of the multiplication grid. Second, it was noted that the exponentiation chart â€œdoesnâ€™t fold over like adding and multiplyingâ€; in other words, whereas the addition and multiplication grids are symmetric about the line y = x, the exponentiation grid is not. Third, â€œthe diagonal of one table is the 2-row of the next.â€ That is, just as the values along the diagonal y = x of the addition grid (. . . â€“4, â€“2, 0, 2, 4, . . .) correspond to those of the row y = 2 of the multiplication grid, so the values along the diagonal y = x of the multiplication grid (. . . 4, 1, 0, 1, 4, . . .) correspond to those of the row y = 2 of the exponentiation grid.",,
28,Exponentiation_ A New Basic_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"These observations set up preliminary discussions of the lack of commutativity with exponentiation and the nature of the values on the y = x diagonals of the grids. Students were asked to settle the first issue among themselves, quickly agreeing that steepnesses and flattenings had to do with the fact that multiplication â€œcan change things faster than addition, so multiplying over and over will really change things.â€ The second observation was also addressed quickly. After analyzing several examples, students soon agreed that there was good reason for the lack of symmetry in the exponentiation chart. As one student explained, â€œAny number to the 1 [first power] is just itself, but 1 to any number is 1. So it all breaks down right away . . . and it gets worse as the numbers get bigger.â€",,
29,Exponentiation_ A New Basic_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The third observation, however, proved to be more of a sticking point. Students were able to recognize the relationship between the values along the diagonal y = x in one chart and the row y = 2 of the next, but were clearly struggling with how to represent the values appearing along the diagonal y = x of the exponentiation chart. The break came when a cluster of students noticed a pattern in the different ways that relationships can be expressed when moving from addition through multiplication to exponentiation. That is,",,
30,Exponentiation_ A New Basic_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"â€¢ on the addition grid, the values along the diagonal y = x are doubles, and so can be written as either â€œx + xâ€ or â€œx Ã— 2â€; and",,
31,Exponentiation_ A New Basic_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"â€¢ on the multiplication grid, the values along the diagonal y = x are squares, and so can be written as either â€œx Ã— xâ€ or â€œx2.â€",,
32,Exponentiation_ A New Basic_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"That set up the realization that â€œxxâ€ should describe the values along the diagonal y = x on the exponentiation grid (11, 22, 33, 44, and so on). However, that insight was accompanied by a question: What is the second way of writing â€œxxâ€? The query sparked a flurry of discussion, and my immediate sense was that the issue revolved around the notation for exponentiation.",,
33,Exponentiation_ A New Basic_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I wanted to return to the task at hand, so I promised to look into the matter for the next day, reminding students that our immediate purpose was more to make observations than to explain them.",,
34,Exponentiation_ A New Basic_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Moving on to the fourth quadrant, students quickly noted vertical patterns of decrease that reflected patterns of increase in the first quadrant. Examining the left side of the grid did not happen so quickly, however. That work occupied the balance of the session because a number of quandaries arose. Predictably, the oscillation between positive and negative values was confusing to and uncomfortable for many students; however, satisfactory explanations that were based on even and odd numbers of multiplications were quickly offered. The more compelling question involved â€œWhat happens between the rows?â€ on the left side. The calculators could handle fractional exponents and positive bases (e.g., 42.6), but they displayed ERROR when negative bases were entered (e.g., (â€“4)2.6). I deflected the queries, advising that online tools were available for anyone wishing to dig into the emergent issues.",,
35,Exponentiation_ A New Basic_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"As part of that deflection, I also mentioned that a new number system is actually needed to talk about what lurks between the lines of the exponentiation grid. Although I elected not to delve explicitly into imaginary and complex numbers, I drew an analogy to other operation charts and other number systems. In particular, the need for signed numbers arose in creating addition and subtraction grids; that need also occurred for fractional numbers when creating multiplication and division grids. It makes sense that another operation might present the need for another set of numbers.",,
36,Exponentiation_ A New Basic_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,WEDNESDAY,,
37,Exponentiation_ A New Basic_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The third lesson focused on identifying analogies between the operations of addition and multiplication. Together we wondered if these analogies might be extended to apply to exponentiation. To kick-start discussions, and prompted by the problems encountered with xx the previous day, I noted that the symbolism for exponentiation could be problematic because it might obscure the relationship to other operations. To highlight similarities to â€œ2 + 3â€ and â€œ2 Ã— 3,â€ I proposed 2 â†‘ 3, which is one of several accepted notations (Cajori 2007). The resulting set of pairs:",,
38,Exponentiation_ A New Basic_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
39,Exponentiation_ A New Basic_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"seemed to satisfy the desire for parallel representations that had emerged the day before. For consistency with the other operations, I recommended that the new notation be read as â€œ2 exponentiated by 3.â€",,
40,Exponentiation_ A New Basic_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I set up the dayâ€™s task by extending a chart they had worked on earlier in the year when comparing properties of addition to properties of multiplication. We began with the first four rows of table 2. I reminded students of their earlier work to get things started, and then invited suggestions for completing the row labeled â€œCommutative property.â€",,
41,Exponentiation_ A New Basic_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Of course, the main point of this activity was to deepen understandings of exponentiation. A secondary purpose was to support understandings of the relationship among mathematical ideas on the basis of a vital difference between concepts studied at the elementary and secondary levels. Whereas almost all the concepts encountered at the elementary level can be interpreted in terms of (i.e., are analogous to) objects and actions in the physical world, the analogies for concepts at the secondary level are mostly mathematical objects (see Hofstadter and Sander 2013). Making analogies, then, is both a mechanism for extending mathematical insight and a window into the structure of mathematics knowledge.",,
42,Exponentiation_ A New Basic_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Before setting the students to work on their own, I indicated that they should not worry about the last column. That would be Thursdayâ€™s focus. The rest of the session was spent filling in blank cells, an effort that began in small groups and ended in whole-group negotiations of acceptable, parallel phrasings for each entry (see the second row in table 2). It is notable that the final three rows of the chart were additions proposed by the students themselves.",,
43,Exponentiation_ A New Basic_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
44,Exponentiation_ A New Basic_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,THURSDAY,,
45,Exponentiation_ A New Basic_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,The fourth session was devoted to exploring whether the speculations from Wednesday were true or false.,,
46,Exponentiation_ A New Basic_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Students worked in small groups and focused on speculations of their choosing. They also used the Internet. Topics in the follow-up discussion included a problem with the speculation on inverse values, in other words,",,
47,Exponentiation_ A New Basic_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
48,Exponentiation_ A New Basic_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,because the exponentiation gridsuggested,,
49,Exponentiation_ A New Basic_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
50,Exponentiation_ A New Basic_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"If the speculation were true, it would mean that the exponential inverse of every number would be 0, which most felt to be nonsensical. In addition, it rendered the speculation on â€œoperating on the oppositeâ€ similarly troublesome.",,
51,Exponentiation_ A New Basic_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I elected to leave these discussions unsettled, suggesting that our simple analogies might be misleading. I also suggested that further studies in high school would shed some light on a few of the details, a point that was supported by topics that came up in studentsâ€™ Web searches, including logarithms, imaginary and complex number systems, and tetration (iterated exponentiation).",,
52,Exponentiation_ A New Basic_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,FRIDAY,,
53,Exponentiation_ A New Basic_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The fifth and final session with the students was devoted to reviewing and consolidating the ideas of the week. I framed the session by developing the diagram presented in figure 5, through which I suggested that the geometric image best fitted to addition is the line, to multiplication is a rectangle, and to exponentiation is a fractal. That thought was tied in to a â€œfractal cardsâ€ activity (Simmt and Davis 1998) that the students had undertaken earlier in the school year.",,
54,Exponentiation_ A New Basic_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
55,Exponentiation_ A New Basic_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The balance of the lesson was used to conduct searches and look across instances of exponential growth and decay (e.g., creating fractal cards, noting population growth, viewing species decline, analyzing greenhouse gas increases, noting technology evolution). These topics were framed by a documentary called Powers of Tenâ„¢ (Eames and Eames 1977) and an interactive PreziÂ© titled â€œThe Scale of the Universeâ€ (Huang and Huang 2012). Exponential growth curves emerged as a uniting image across these explorations. These growth curves also proved useful as a recap of the week because they referred to the images and grid developed on Monday and Tuesday.",,
56,Exponentiation_ A New Basic_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,STUDENTSâ€™ REACTIONS,,
57,Exponentiation_ A New Basic_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"When I engage in these sorts of teaching activities, I make sure that time is set aside in each session for students to annotate their work in whatever ways they wish. In this case, an interesting pattern of commentary emerged over the week.",,
58,Exponentiation_ A New Basic_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"As I had expected, responses to the drawing activity on Monday consisted mainly of expressions of pleasure alongside emergent patterns of surprise at how quickly quantities changed. Such exclamations continued on Tuesday, but many students shifted to a more questioning mode as they wondered about the patterns they were seeing in the exponentiation table. On Wednesday, these thoughts prevailed alongside, for most students, confessions of not understanding as deeply as they wished. The annotations on Thursday continued in a similar vein, with fewer students focusing on their confusion and more students displaying interest in making further conjectures. On Friday, in addition to expressions of surprise and pleasure, much more frequent references were made to events in their lives (e.g., one thought that had permeated the room was the ever-accelerating pace of technological change). This flow of commentary reaffirmed my hope that rethinking how we teach exponentiation might contribute to a school mathematics focus that is more tightly fitted to the realities and needs of todayâ€™s world.",,
59,Exponentiation_ A New Basic_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"However, as I continued to reflect on the experience and the studentsâ€™ annotations of their work, a different line of thinking regularly presented itself: Little of what happened during that week could be used to bolster either side of the persistent skills-versus-understanding debates in school mathematics. Certainly nothing that the students wrote was in any way reflective of the poles of the debate. Although both procedural and conceptual knowledge were being developed, it did not feel as though the activity was â€œaboutâ€ such concerns in the moment of engagement.",,
60,Exponentiation_ A New Basic_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Rather, I experienced the activity more as a moment of bringing school mathematics in tighter conversation with the work of mathematicians. The topic offered opportunities to examine relationships within mathematics, engage in conjecture and argument, and consolidate understandings of prior operations. Thus, I am left wondering if, in addition to contributing to a mathematics curriculum that is more relevant to todayâ€™s world, this sort of â€œcurriculum momentâ€ might also help us reframe a weary and unproductive debate. I cannot help but wonder if the persistence of the â€œmath warsâ€ is rooted in the simple fact that questions are rarely raised about the â€œbasicâ€ status of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division within school math.",,
