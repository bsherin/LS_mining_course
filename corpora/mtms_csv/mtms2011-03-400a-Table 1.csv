"We asked students to consider what a Flatlander—someone living in a two-dimensional universe—would look like. Using the whiteboard at the front of the room to represent a two-dimensional universe, one student drew “Tyler” (see fi g. 1). We asked students to explain how Tyler the Flatlander would see and how he would eat. Tyler would have to look through his body to see someone  rick Anderson and Jamie A.

"What if we lived in a two-dimensional universe? What would we look like? Where could we go? In our universe, what would happen if we were to travel straight up from Earth into space? Would we eventually hit a boundary? Could we return to Earth without taking any turns? from the curriculum unit Exploring the Shape of Space (Weeks 2001). We began by considering implications of living in a two-dimensional universe, which we introduced as Flatland. Next, we considered ways that a two-dimensional universe could be connected and whether or not such a universe had a boundary. Finally, students considered how their thinking of two-dimensional universes could extend to three or even four dimensions. We hoped that students would be challenged to think more deeply about  posed to seventh-grade and eighthgrade students as they explored the shape of space. We wanted them to consider mathematical notions of space and dimension, which are typically not part of the middle school curriculum. ",9,mtms2011-03-400a,,
These were some of the questions ,10,mtms2011-03-400a,,
"Fig. 2 With an understanding of the limits of two-dimensional living, this student labeled his Flatlander’s body parts.",11,mtms2011-03-400a,,
"We concluded our introduction to Flatland by showing students the animated film Flatland (Caplan, Johnson, and Travis 2007), based on Abbott’s 1884 book. In the film, inhabitants of two-dimensional Flatland are two-dimensional geometric shapes. The grandfather square comes to know about Linelanders living in a one-dimensional universe and a point in zero dimensions. With his hexagonal granddaughter, they question the existence of a third dimension when visited by a sphere from threedimensional space. The hexagon also wonders about a fourth dimension, which is scoffed at by the sphere. The combination of viewing the film and previous work gave students an opportunity to think more deeply about the shape of a two-dimensional universe. ",12,mtms2011-03-400a,,

"beside him because his eyes were on the inside. Realizing that all objects in Flatland must remain in the plane, a student pointed out that Tyler’s food would hit him on the side of the head. Through the discussion, the class realized that everything about a Flatlander needed to be contained in the two-dimensional Flatland universe. ",15,mtms2011-03-400a,,
"Together, we revised Tyler on the basis of a suggestion that he look more like the Pac-Man® video character (see fig. 1b). That is, both his eye (on the edge, or boundary, of his head) and his mouth would have  to be repositioned. Flatlanders could not walk over obstacles in their twodimensional world but would have to walk around them; they could not go up or down without leaving their twodimensional universe. ",16,mtms2011-03-400a,,
"Having completed the initial investigation, we felt students understood the distinctions of living in a two-dimensional universe. We then asked them to draw and show details of a Flatlander’s body. One student’s Flatlander (see fig. 2) shows his understanding of body parts on the plane. ",17,mtms2011-03-400a,,
"Fig. 1 An initial drawing of “Tyler,” a Flatlander, was revised so that the eye(s) and mouth would allow him to both see and eat.  (a)  (b) infinite? We asked students to draw a simple Flatlander on a sheet of paper. If the paper represented a Flatlander’s universe, it was obvious to the students that the universe was finite and that the edge of the paper was a boundary. ",18,mtms2011-03-400a,,
We asked if it was possible for a ,19,mtms2011-03-400a,,
"Flatlander to travel in a straight path and return to his or her starting location. After a few moments, the idea of wrapping the paper and connecting two edges spread throughout the classroom. Now we had a different Flatland universe. This new universe still had finite area and a boundary, but a Flatlander could move around it in different ways. This Flatland universe looked like a cylinder. A Flatlander, however, would still experience it as flat in two dimensions although it would be boundless in one dimension.",20,mtms2011-03-400a,,
"We wanted students to consider various other ways that the Flatlander’s universe could be connected, with or without a boundary. Could it have finite area but no boundary? Could it have infinite area but still have a boundary? Could the universe be connected in other ways? ",21,mtms2011-03-400a,,
"After watching the film, some students felt that the animation suggested that the Flatlander’s universe might be infinite and have no boundary. That is, the Flatland universe might have no boundaries with unlimited area or no boundaries but a finite area. For example, Flatlanders could live on the two-dimensional surface of a sphere, like a flat bug living on the Earth’s surface. Students also realized that a half-plane would be infinite, but it would have a boundary. In a universe with boundaries, a Flatlander would reach a wall that could not be passed. In those planes with a finite area, the Flatlander could visit every location in a finite amount of time.",22,mtms2011-03-400a,,

"In addition to finite or infinite area and boundaries of a universe, we wanted students to think about how the Flatland universe (a two-dimensional surface) could be connected. Computer games (Weeks 2001), tic-tac-toe, crossword puzzles, and mazes helped students develop a better understanding of these ideas. Table 1 summarizes the shapes of two-dimensional space that the students explored. ",24,mtms2011-03-400a,,
"The cylinder had already been  discussed as a possible shape for the Flatland universe. This universe allowed the Flatlanders to go in one direction without a boundary; however, they would eventually encounter the boundary if they went in other directions. ",25,mtms2011-03-400a,,
"To continue developing intuition  about the cylinder and to prepare them for later games on other surfaces, students played tic-tac-toe on cylinders. Since two edges of a rectangle were connected to create a cylinder, two sides of the tic-tac-toe board were connected. As a result, students could win a tic-tac-toe game with three in a row, even if the three were connected across the seam (see fig. 3). ",26,mtms2011-03-400a,,
"Since we needed a way to show the  cylindrical game board on paper, we used a gluing diagram to show how it was connected (Weeks 2001). We asked students to identify different  ways that three in a row could be possible if they connected across the seam of the gluing diagram.",27,mtms2011-03-400a,,
"A torus was considered as the next  possible two-dimensional universe for Flatlanders. This shape can be described as a rectangular figure with both sets of opposite sides connected (see table 1). Although difficult to create with paper, the gluing diagram indicated the way the torus was to be connected. Most students were familiar with the idea, having played such video games as Pac-Man or Asteroids®: The top is connected to the bottom, and the left side is connected to the right side. ",28,mtms2011-03-400a,,
"Students, adept at working on  tori mazes on paper or on the computer, then developed their abilities by working on tori crossword puzzles and games. They quickly realized that although the area was finite (there is limited area for the maze or letters in the crossword puzzles), there were no boundaries. In this universe, a Flatlander could return to the same position after heading off in a straight line in any direction.",29,mtms2011-03-400a,,
"Students continued their exploration of surfaces found in a Flatlander’s universe—but with a twist. Students connected the ends of a strip of paper  o Möbius strips provide students  with a context to consider finite and infinite area, as well as the  existence of boundaries.  table 1 The attributes of these various-shaped universes were studied by students.  shape of the universe",30,mtms2011-03-400a,,

"No after giving one end a half-turn to create a Möbius strip. (On the gluing diagram the tabs are reversed.) Students explored the differences between a Möbius strip and a cylinder. We asked them to begin at one point in the middle of the strip and trace until they returned to the starting point. They were surprised that the Möbius strip had only one side! It also had one boundary circle. An imaginary bug, crawling along the boundary, would visit the entire boundary before coming back to the starting location. ",52,mtms2011-03-400a,,
"Students were intrigued to play tic-tac-toe on the computer version of a Möbius strip because they had to account for the twist when considering their next move (see fi g. 4).

"The Klein bottle, the fi nal two- dimensional surface, was introduced as a rectangular sheet of paper with the left and right sides connected like a cylinder and the top and bottom connected like a Möbius strip. This new universe had no boundary, but the area was fi nite. Although the Klein bottle is sometimes thought of as it appears in three dimensions (see table 1), the students worked with the rectangular gluing diagram. They played tic-tac-toe and made crossword puzzles to get a better sense of the way a Klein bottle was connected. ",54,mtms2011-03-400a,,
"We asked students to make their own crossword puzzles on gluing diagrams for the Klein bottle so that they would get a better sense of the ways it was connected across the seams.

"The games provided an engaging context in which to explore each possible Flatland universe. Students developed a good sense of the ways that a two-dimensional surface can be connected, with or without a boundary. We wanted them to go beyond the two-dimensional surfaces for Flatlanders and consider shapes for a three-dimensional universe. After discussing a two-dimensional torus, they readily extended their thinking to a three-dimensional torus.
