The following activity, which has been used in the classroom, gives teachers some techniques and an effective bridge to help students overcome this initial roadblock to algebra.  gers is one of the first major avenues, and roadblocks, to student success in the learning of algebra. Unfortunately, many students cannot make, or have a very difficult time making, the transition from working with whole numbers to working with integers. Students who struggle and do not succeed in making this transition undoubtedly find themselves at a disadvantage when trying to make sense of subsequent mathematical concepts that rely on their proficiency with and understanding of the addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of integers.

"A common question asked by teachers concerns the appropriate time to play the game as it relates to learning integers. In other words, should the game be played before, during, or after introducing integers? Although I prefer to play the game first, then show some addition and subtraction problems to initiate the discussion about the game’s relation to integers, the answer is an unequivocal yes. Play the game at any time. You will not only get a better sense of what works for you, but the students will also have a point of reference from which to compare, think about, and discuss the concept of integers. The key to this activity is the use of individual reflections, small-group dialogue, and whole-class discussion to make an explicit connection (Leinwand and Fleischman 2004) between the rules of the game and the mathematical ideas embedded in the game.

overview of the gaMe,15,mtms2007-08-10a,,
"Before starting the game, students form groups of three and assign the role of dealer, decision maker, or scorekeeper to a group member. Although students in each group will take turns assuming each of the three roles at every level of the game, to minimize confusion students should agree who will have which role before the start of each game. After going over the general rules of the game (fig. 2) with the class, each group receives the rules for level 1 (fig. 3), a deck of cards, a black pen, and a pad of paper.

"What follows are explanations and examples of the different levels of the game, with discussion of some of the mathematical concepts used throughout. Keep in mind that the connections are not meant to be exhaustive; they are meant to illustrate the different types of comments and insights that students can make or be encouraged to make when discussing the game’s mathematics. Finally, the rules of the game for each level are available in a PowerPoint format, which can be used to make overhead transparencies and/ or master copies of the rules for the decision maker at each level (see www .ivcampus.sdsu.edu/math_ed/ index_files/itsallinthecards.pps).",18,mtms2007-08-10a,,
level 1: defining integers,19,mtms2007-08-10a,,
"After playing this level with its respective rules (fig. 3), students usually conclude that the mathematics involves making comparisons between the cards and adding the tally marks after each game (fig. 4). Although the primary goal of this level is to have students familiarize themselves with their respective roles, level 1 play defines, albeit indirectly, the three types of numbers that comprise the set of integers: positive numbers (black), negative numbers (red), and the number zero (joker). Level 1 intentionally forces students to ignore the numbers on the cards and focus on the sign  (color) of the cards and their respective order; positives (black cards) are greater than zero (the joker), both of which are greater than negatives (red cards). A number line can illustrate this scenario (fig. 5).",20,mtms2007-08-10a,,
level 2: order of integers,21,mtms2007-08-10a,,
"After reading the rules for level 2  (fig. 6) and before students start to play the game, they usually want to know how to record a tie. Should they give no tally mark or record one tally to each player? Each group is allowed to decide how to score a tie. As students begin to play the game, some groups will get two jokers and ask how to score such a hand because players will, in the spirit of competition, look for ways to differentiate them to get more points. When this occurs, the teacher can explain to the whole class that two jokers, regardless of what they look like, result in a tie.",22,mtms2007-08-10a,,
"With respect to the mathematics used in this level, students will again mention the addition of tally marks and may note that they are now comparing the numbers, as opposed to just the colors, to decide the winner after each hand. Scorekeeping is similar to that of level 1. The discussion to make the connection to the mathematics in this level takes a very different turn when students are asked to think about and identify the strongest and  weakest cards. At first, students share the notion that the order of cards is that the black cards are the strongest, the joker is the next strongest, and the red cards are weakest. However, a more specific discussion ensues as students focus their attention on identifying the strongest black cards, based on their number (a higher number wins); a similar discussion develops when identifying the strongest red cards (a smaller number wins). As a result, the number line developed in level 1 evolves to include numbers ordered from weakest to strongest, with respect to the joker, or zero.

level 3: absolute value and oPPosites,39,mtms2007-08-10a,,
"The key difference between level 3 and level 2 play pertains to scoring. As shown in the rules for level 3 (fig. 8), students stop using tally marks to keep score and begin to calculate the number of points to give to the winner. From the students’ perspective, the mathematics involved in this level now includes adding and subtracting numbers each time that a hand is played and finding the sum of all the points (fig. 9) by the scorekeeper at the end of each game. If students ask about the order in which they should subtract the numbers, remind them to subtract as they always have. ",40,mtms2007-08-10a,,
"From a content perspective,  students begin to develop experience with two essential concepts when finding the sum of two integers: opposites and absolute value. As students play this level of the game, they quickly recognize that two cards with the same number but different colors will result in no points to the winner. Asking students to share their insights about such an observation can lead to a rich discussion that can culminate in the definition of opposites and the reasons why one gets a zero when joining two opposites. Another outcome involves noting how students begin to internalize the process of adding numbers when the cards are the same color and subtracting the numbers when the cards are different colors. In fact, students ignore the colors of the cards, that is, finding the absolute value of the numbers, to determine the number of points that the winner should receive after playing each hand. This type of experience opens the door to a discussion about the concept of absolute value, which  will help form a bridge for finding the sum of integers in subsequent levels of the game. Finally, using number lines or colored counters can help facilitate such discussions (fig. 10) and help students better understand level 4 ideas, which follow.",41,mtms2007-08-10a,,
level 4: Putting the correct sign on the result,42,mtms2007-08-10a,,
"Before students start play at level 4, each group needs a red pen to keep score. The scorekeeper must record the appropriate number of points using  either a black or a red pen (fig. 11). By playing a hand in front of the class, teachers can demonstrate how to keep score in this level and help scorekeepers understand what to do throughout the game. Most groups will ask how they should decide who wins after all the cards are dealt. Typically, scorekeepers will not pay attention to the last sentence in the rules and will find the total number of points as they did in level 3, that is, they will add up all the points. When asked to explain how they computed the scores after each hand and what pen they used to record the score, scorekeepers usually realize that they should apply that same logic when calculating the overall game score. It is interesting to note that many groups will implicitly use the commutative property to add integers when they combine all the red scores and all the black scores as a faster way to get the final score. Another issue that may arise has to do with the ink color that scorekeepers should use when the score is a zero. Should it be red or black? Asking  students to explain why the color matters helps them realize that the color of the zero has no meaning within the context of the game or within the context of integers. ",43,mtms2007-08-10a,,
"Ideally, discussing mathematical ideas at level 4 is completed concurrently with that of level 3. After all, the key difference between the two levels lies in the assignment of a color (sign) to the scores that students get when playing the game. A discussion while using a number line and counters can help students grasp the reasons why some results are negative and others positive (fig. 12), particularly as they relate to the magnitude, or absolute value, of numbers with opposite signs.  level 5: adding and  subtracting integers",44,mtms2007-08-10a,,
"In level 5 play, the dealer brings back the aces, kings, queens, and jacks discarded earlier, but they are kept in a separate pile. (See the rules in fig. 13.) These cards, called trap cards, represent the symbols of addition  (black) and subtraction (red) and are placed between any two cards that are dealt to the players. Explain to the class that black trap cards have no effect on the other two cards and that red trap cards do have an effect; they change the color of the card that is on the right-hand side of the dealer, clarifying that once the effect takes place, the red trap card also changes color because it has no more effects (like a black trap card).

In the search to find something different, I looked through my desk, found a deck of cards, and thought to myself: “If black is positive, red is negative, and the joker is zero, then the deck of cards can be used to learn about integers.”",59,mtms2007-08-10a,,
"And yet, one can wonder why someone would want to teach stu- groups will have to determine any effects before assigning points to the winner. This process allows students to develop experience changing subtraction to addition by getting the opposite of the subtrahend. ",60,mtms2007-08-10a,,
"Once all groups have completed play at level 5, students can be asked to write about the mathematics that they have been using throughout each level of the game. After a few minutes of reflection and writing, students can discuss their ideas in their groups, with the intent of having each group share its thoughts with the whole class. The teacher can then facilitate the discussion and write on the board what students share. Assuming that there has been no previous discussion about the mathematics used at each level, the conversation with the class will come as a big surprise to most students when a problem such as –7 + 4 is written on the board, and they are asked to decide how this problem is related to the game. At this point, one can then begin to develop a bridge between the meanings of such mathematical symbols and the manner in  which the students have been playing the game (fig. 14). For instance, when presenting –7 + 4, one could ask the class to decide how many points the winner would get if the cards were a red 7, a black jack, and a black 4. Noting that the addition symbol is represented by the black jack, a trap card that has no effect, the sum of –7 and 4 is –3 (a red 3). Similarly, one could write 4 – (–3) on the board and discuss with the class its relation to the game. The key is to recognize that these discussions help students make the transition to the use of mathematical symbols, instead of cards, and to help them understand the logic behind those symbols so they can successfully simplify these types of numerical expressions.  conclusion",61,mtms2007-08-10a,,
"There are times, in our own journey toward becoming better mathematics teachers, when the window of opportunity for our own transformation occurs as a direct result of helping our peers. So it was for me when a colleague called to get an idea on how  dents about integers in what many would consider to be a roundabout way. After all, how is having students memorize the rules of this game different from having them memorize the rules for adding and subtracting integers? Perhaps the key lies in the fun that students have when playing the game (engagement), or the bridge that the game creates for students to visualize integers (representation), or the opportunity for students to work together in groups (communication) to make sense of the game (connections), or the interaction of all these factors that are essential for high-quality mathematics education to occur (NCTM 2000). Given that learning how to add and subtract integers is a major roadblock for students in their journey toward succeeding with algebra, we need to slow down, engage the students, and help them form bridges to improve their own understanding of mathematics. This activity can do just that for your students, as it has for many already. ",62,mtms2007-08-10a,,
