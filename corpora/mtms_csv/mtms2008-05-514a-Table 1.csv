The Importance of in the Middle Grades,0,mtms2008-05-514a,,
"Understanding equal sign tThe equal sign is perhaps the most prevalent symbol in school mathematics,  and developing an understanding of it has typically been considered mathematically straightforward. In fact, after its initial introduction during students’ early elementary school education, little, if any, instructional time is explicitly spent on the concept in the later grades. Yet research suggests that many students at all grade levels have not developed adequate understandings of the meaning of the equal sign (Baroody and Ginsburg 1983; Behr, Erlwanger, and Nichols 1980; Falkner, Levi, and Carpenter 1999; Kieran 1981; Knuth et al. 2006).

"Middle school students (grades 6–8) were asked to provide a definition for the equal sign symbol (see fig. 1). This question required students to name the equal sign symbol (first prompt); provide a statement regarding the symbol’s meaning (second prompt); and then, if possible, provide a statement regarding an alternative meaning (third prompt). The rationale for the first prompt was to preempt students from using the name of the symbol in their response to the second prompt (e.g., “the symbol means equal”). The rationale for the third prompt was based on our previous work, in which we found that students often offer more than one interpretation when given the opportunity.",7,mtms2008-05-514a,,

"We classified student responses to parts (b) and (c) into four categories: relational, operational, other, or no response/don’t know. A response was categorized as relational if the student expressed the general idea that the equal sign represents an equivalence relation between two quantities—the definition we would like to see from students. The following student responses are representative of those categorized as relational: •  “It means that what is to the left  and right of the sign mean the same thing.” (grade 6 student) •  “The same as, same value.”   (grade 7 student) •  “The left side of the equals sign and the right side of the equals sign are the same value.” (grade 8 student)",11,mtms2008-05-514a,,
A response was categorized as operational if the student expressed the general idea that the equal sign means “add the numbers” or “the answer.” The following student responses are representative of those categorized as operational: •  “What the sum of the two numbers are.” (grade 6 student) •  “A sign connecting the answer to  the problem.” (grade 7 student) •  “The total.” (grade 8 student) •  “How much the numbers added together equal.” (grade 8 student) table 1 Percent of students at each grade level who provided each type of equal sign definition as their best definition (n = 375),12,mtms2008-05-514a,,

Many students provided two definitions, sometimes one relational and one operational; in such cases, the responses were assigned an overall category of relational.",18,mtms2008-05-514a,,
"Table 1 presents the distribution of equal sign definitions as a function of grade. (Recall that in cases where students provided two definitions, they were assigned an overall category for their best definition; thus, table 1 displays students’ best definitions. There were fewer students who only provided a definition that was categorized as relational—11 percent in grade 6, 16 percent in grade 7, and 24 percent in grade 8.) How do these data compare with your predictions about student responses? As seen in the table, the majority of students provided definitions that were categorized as operational, whereas substantially fewer students provided definitions categorized as relational. Although we do see improvement in the definitions categorized as relational as students progress through middle school, increasing from 29 percent in grade 6 to 46 percent in grade 8, such improvement is relatively modest. Overall, the results are somewhat discouraging—fewer than  half the students in each grade demonstrated a relational view of the equal sign. Perhaps not surprising, given the lack of attention the equal sign receives in middle school curricula and instruction, an understanding of the equal sign does not seem to improve significantly as students progress through middle school.",19,mtms2008-05-514a,,
What Might account For the PredoMinance oF an oPerational VieW oF the equal sign?,20,mtms2008-05-514a,,
"Researchers have argued that the operational view of the equal sign is largely a by-product of students’ experiences with the symbol in elementary school mathematics (e.g., Baroody and Ginsburg 1983; Carpenter et al. 2003; McNeil and Alibali 2005). During elementary school, students typically encounter the equal sign in number sentences that have operations on the left side of the equal sign and an answer blank on the right side (e.g., 5 + 2 = __, 11 – 4 + 1 = __). In solving such “operations equal answer” equations correctly, it is not really necessary for students to think about the equal sign as a symbol of equivalence; rather, students need only perform the calculations on the left side of the equal sign to get an answer. As a result, students associate the equal sign with the arithmetic operations performed to get a final answer. Unfortunately, this operational view of the equal sign is often reinforced  year after year as students gain more and more experience with traditional arithmetic equations during their elementary school years.",21,mtms2008-05-514a,,
"Because an operational view of the  equal sign is well established by the time students reach middle school, it may be far from trivial for students to acquire a relational view of the equal sign during middle school. Further compounding this problem is the fact that very little attention is paid to the symbol in middle school curricular materials. Our analysis of four popular middle school mathematics textbooks revealed that equations are frequently presented in an “operations on the left side of the equal sign” format and are rarely presented in an “operations on both sides of the equal sign” format (for more detail about the textbook study, see McNeil et al. 2006). This pattern of exposure may actually condition students to favor less sophisticated interpretations of the equal sign and, as we shall see next, such interpretations may have important consequences for students in learning algebra.",22,mtms2008-05-514a,,
does it really Matter iF students VieW the equal sign relationally?,23,mtms2008-05-514a,,
"A natural question to ask is whether it really makes a difference when learning mathematics (and algebra, in particular) if students view the equal sign relationally. To answer this question, we asked students to respond to items that are more typical of what they might see in an algebra class, and then we examined their success in solving these items as well as the strategies they used as a function of their views of the equal sign. One set of items required students to determine solutions to linear equations (see fig. 2), whereas another set of items required students to make judgments regarding the solutions to equivalent equations (see fig. 3).",24,mtms2008-05-514a,,

"The equation-solving items  required students to determine the solution to typical beginning algebra equations. We used the prompt “What value of m will make the following number sentences true?” for two reasons. First, we wanted to avoid running into problems associated with students misunderstanding the more typical (in terms of beginning algebra) prompt, “Solve the equation.” Many students in middle school, particularly sixth- and seventh-grade students, would likely be unfamiliar with such a prompt. Second, we felt that the prompt would likely be more consistent with language often used in elementary school (i.e., “What value will make the number sentence  8 +   = 12 true?”).",29,mtms2008-05-514a,,
"The equivalent equations items required students to determine whether the missing value for one equation was the same as the missing value for a second (equivalent) equation. In both cases, we expected that students who viewed the equal sign as representing an equivalence relation between quantities (a relational view of the equal sign) would recognize that the operations performed on the second equation of each pair preserved the quantitative relationship expressed in the first equation of each pair. It is also worth noting that the operations applied to the second (equivalent) equation in both items are atypical in that they are not operations that would normally be applied in the process of solving the first equation (e.g., subtracting 15 from both sides of the equation). We decided to use atypical operations to deter students from simply recognizing  2 × c + 15 = 31         2 × c + 15 – 9 = 31 – 9 (b)  In the equation c + 18 = 35, the number that goes in the c is 17. Can you use this fact to help you figure out what number goes in the c in the equation c + 18 + 27 = 35 + 27? Explain your reasoning.",30,mtms2008-05-514a,,

"In our professional development work with middle school teachers, for example, we encourage teachers to look for opportunities within their existing classroom practices to engage students in conversations about the equal sign as well as to create such opportunities intentionally. As an example of a “naturally” occurring opportunity, most mathematics teachers have likely witnessed the equality “strings” that students often produce (e.g., 3 + 5 = 8 + 2 = 10 + 5 = 15); these equality strings provide an excellent opportunity to discuss with students the meaning of the equal sign and its proper use. To create opportunities intentionally, teachers might provide students with arithmetic (or algebraic) equations to solve in which numbers and operations (or symbolic expressions and operations) appear on both sides of the equal sign. Such equation formats may help promote more appropriate interpretations and uses of the equal sign. Teachers could also provide students with problems such as the equivalent equations items discussed in this article or their arithmetic counterparts (e.g., Is 3 +  5 = 6 + 2 the “same as” 3 + 5 – 4 = 6 + 2 – 4?). Discussing with students the different approaches to solving such problems can help foster more appropriate interpretations of the equal sign. Opportunities such as these can be implemented so that they take little time away from an already crowded curriculum (e.g., as warm-ups), yet still allow teachers to underscore the relational view of the equal sign.",66,mtms2008-05-514a,,
"Improving students’ understanding of the equal sign, and thus their preparation for algebra, may require changes in teachers’ instructional practices as well as changes in elementary and middle school mathematics curricula.
