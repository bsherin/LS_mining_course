"Example 1 is a common algebra item that assesses students’ ability to fi nd the factors of a given expression. However, because the question is not answered after that process is completed, the solver must go a step further to fi nd the sum of three factors. Such questions require students to read the problem carefully, because they cannot anticipate what the question will be asking.",11,mtms2011-03-422a,,
"As with example 1, example 2 does  not end with fi nding the solutions to the given system of linear equations but asks for the difference of the two solutions. Unlike example 1, the computation steps of example 2 are rather complex, involving both rational expressions and nonstandard form. Multiple paths can be taken to solve this system of linear equations. With limited time and without the aid of a graphing calculator, it becomes critical to identify effi cient paths.

"The Basic Competency Test has both a time limit and a no-calculator rule. On average, students can afford to spend only about two minutes on each item. Therefore, it is critical for them to develop the habit of and the ability to mentally evaluate multiple solution paths of a given item, applying good number and symbol sense, before carrying out the computational steps.

For a rational form to be zero, the numerator has to be zero. It will then be advantageous to divide each term by 5, which will transform the equation into 3x + 3y = 1, reducing the size of numbers involved in the calculations. Then the new system of linear equations  2x – 3y = 24 and 3x + 3y = 1 can be solved by the method of elimination, resulting in removal of the term 3y in both equations. A few transformations with the algebraic forms can change a rather complex-looking item to a fairly common exercise when solving a system of linear equations. ",33,mtms2011-03-422a,,

Our analysis suggests another way to assist the transfer from arithmetic to algebraic reasoning: Ask students  to evaluate with numerical expressions rather than compute with numerical answers. Such exercises require both arithmetic and algebraic reasoning.,48,mtms2011-03-422a,,
"Consider the example in ﬁ gure 3 from the July 2008 Basic Competency Test (Committee of the Basic Competency Test for Junior High School Students 2008). To solve such problems quickly without using a calculator, students need to apply certain algebraic techniques. For example, one can solve the problem described above by using the steps shown in ﬁ gure 4a, which applies the difference of two squares. However, it can also be solved by other algebraic techniques, as described in ﬁ gure 4b. ",49,mtms2011-03-422a,,
"Again, this example emphasizes  problem solving and number and symbol sense. The magnitude of the numbers involved in the question in ﬁ gure 3 presents a genuine “problematic situation” for middle school students when they are asked to evaluate them in a limited amount of time without the aid of a calculator. Alternative strategies are needed to help reduce the complexity of the computation. The basis of the alternative strategies in this case requires the recognition of certain symbolic forms (a2 – b2) or (a – b)c and the usefulness of their equivalent expressions in transforming the given expression into manageable computational steps.",50,mtms2011-03-422a,,
"However, symbol sense alone is not  suffi cient. To carry out computation effi ciently, students must use their  number sense to guide the transformations of algebraic expressions. In the solution strategies in ﬁ gure 4, students need to recognize that 320 is a multiple of 160 and that both the sum and difference of multiples of a given number will still be a multiple of that number, in this case, 160. This knowledge is an application of the Patterns of Factors and Multiples Unit that Taiwanese students studied prior to taking the test. With such number sense, students can anticipate many possible simplifi cation steps before calculating with larger numbers. Finally, this type of task encourages middle school students to focus on relationships and not merely on calculating answers. ",51,mtms2011-03-422a,,
"The ability to evaluate numerical expressions using patterns and relationships is fundamental if students are to move from merely exploring patterns with fi nite cases to describing patterns with symbols (Lee and Freiman 2006). This ability is also a key element of making a successful transition from arithmetic to algebraic reasoning, as identifi ed by Kieran (discussed in Cai and Moyer 2008). Tasks such as this give students opportunities to apply algebraic rules and properties (which when fi rst learned are abstract and distant to middle school students) to familiar numerical expressions.

Thus, the algebraic properties are not learned in isolation but are connected through geometric and arithmetic transformations.",75,mtms2011-03-422a,,
"Furthermore, the book emphasizes  providing both arithmetic and algebraic examples and exercises for each related multiplication formula. The arithmetic problems focus on fostering students’ number sense to compute a complex numerical expression without a calculator by connecting the use of the learned algebraic formulas, then evaluating the answer by working with simpler numerical expressions. For example, to fi nd the value of 992, the textbook provides two different solution strategies. Strategy 1 uses the “square of the difference” formula:       992 = (100 – 1)2            = 1002 − 2(100 × 1) + 12            = 10,000 – 200 + 1            = 9801",76,mtms2011-03-422a,,
Strategy 2 uses the “difference of the squares” formula:  992 – 12 = (99 + 1)(99 – 1)                    = 100 × 98                   = 9800             992 = 9800 + 1                   = 9801,77,mtms2011-03-422a,,
