The fi rst 50 terms of a pattern sum to 2000.  1. Describe the pattern.,5,mtms2010-11-200a,,

"The majority of submitted patterns relied on repeating sequences of numbers. Students found pairs of numbers that summed to 80, which is twice 2000 ÷ 50, to create a two-number repeating pattern. Julia, a student at Immacolata School in St. Louis,  Missouri, explained how she created her two-number pattern by dividing 2000 by 50 to get 40, then finding a pair of numbers that summed to 80. By listing twenty-five pairs of numbers that sum to 80, she knew that the first 50 terms would sum to 2000 (see fig. 1). Sam, who attends Robert C. Parker School in Wynantskill, New York, expanded the idea to a fivenumber repeating pattern (see fig. 2). ",9,mtms2010-11-200a,,
Fig. 1 Julia explained her two-number repeated pattern.,10,mtms2010-11-200a,,
"To solve the problem where the first 50 terms of a pattern equaled 2000, I divided 2000 by 50 and got 40. Then I multiplied 40 by 2 and got 80. I found a pair of two numbers that equaled 80, then wrote out all the numbers until I reached the 100th term. I used (20, 60) as my pattern. So I wrote: 20, 60, 20, 60, 20, 60, 20, 60, 20, 60, 20, 60, 20, 60, 20, 60, 20, 60, 20, 60, 20, 60, 20, 60, 20, 60, 20, 60, 20, 60, 20, 60, 20, 60, 20, 60, 20, 60, 20, 60, 20, 60, 20, 60, 20, 60, 20, 60, 20, 60, 20, 60, 20, 60, 20, 60, 20, 60, 20, 60, 20, 60, 20, 60, 20, 60, 20, 60, 20, 60, 20, 60, 20, 60, 20, 60, 20, 60, 20, 60, 20, 60, 20, 60, 20, 60, 20, 60, 20, 60, 20, 60, 20, 60, 20, 60, 20, 60, 20, 60. So 60 is the 100th term. I then found several terms that would work as well, such as: (70, 10),  (79, 1), (80, 0), (70, 10), (49, 31), (50, 30), (37, 43), (25, 55), (29, 51),  (63, 17), (73, 7), (90, −10), (−30, 110), (−20, 100), (120, −40),  (67, 13), (78, 2), (75, 5), (71, 9), (65, 15), and (45, 35).",11,mtms2010-11-200a,,
"Some students created alternating patterns, in which the odd terms formed one pattern and the even terms formed another pattern. These patterns were also based on the idea of creating pairs of numbers that summed to 80. Hannah, another student at the Robert C. Parker School, described her alternating pattern (see fig. 3) in which the numbers became increasingly distant from 40. ",12,mtms2010-11-200a,,
Middle school math preservice  teacher candidates at Northern Michigan University in Marquette created additive patterns that were based on using formulas for arithmetic sequences learned in class. Figure 4 lists additive patterns that they developed as well as examples of other patterns that students created.,13,mtms2010-11-200a,,

Fig. 2 Sam explained his five-number repeated pattern in terms of sets.,21,mtms2010-11-200a,,
"I created my pattern using the idea of sets. I realized that if I could create a 5-term set that summed to 200, e.g., 100, 75, 10, 5, 10, then I would have my pattern. I knew this to be true because they are ten 5-term sets in the first 50 terms, so if my set summed to 200, then the math is simply 200 × 10 = 2000. This idea of sets can also be used with sets of two and sets of ten.",22,mtms2010-11-200a,,
Fig. 3 Hannah explored an alternating pattern.,23,mtms2010-11-200a,,
"In the pattern I came up with, the first term is 39 and the second term is 41. Every other term starting with the first counts down one number so it is 39, ___, 38, ___, 37 and so on. The 2nd term is 41 and every other term starting with the 2nd term increases by 1. So the pattern is 39, 41, 38, 42, 37, 43, etc.",24,mtms2010-11-200a,,
