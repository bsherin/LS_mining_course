4,Math for Real: Shaking Things Up with the Richter Scale,"Developed in 1934 by Charles F. Richter, the Richter scale was used for many years to describe the energy released by an earthquake. Currently, the most common way to measure  the strength of an earthquake is the  Moment Magnitude Scale, which  is based on some of the same mathematics as the Richter scale.

5,Math for Real: Shaking Things Up with the Richter Scale,"The amplitude of the waves of  vibrations created by an earthquake  is recorded, in millimeters, by a seismograph. To estimate the Richter scale measure, write the amplitude, in mm, as 10 raised to an exponent (10x), then add 3 to the exponent, x. For example, if the amplitude is 100 mm, rewrite 100 as 102. Adding 3 to the exponent gives an estimated Richter scale rating of 2 + 3 = 5.",5,Math for Real: Shaking Things Up with the Richter Scale
