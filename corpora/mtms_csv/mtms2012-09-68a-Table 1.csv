"A participant asked about this problem, noting that if there were more than 3 cookies left, the remainder could be smaller than 7. For example, if there were 7 cookies left in each bag, there would be 70 total remaining; these 70 cookies divided among 23 people would result in  1 cookie left. Have you heard this question before?

"Jane-Jane Lo and Feng-Chiu Tsai respond: Thank you so much for your question about this article. Sunny Chin-Look from Alhambra, California, first asked me about this question and made the same interpretation of the phrase “at least 3 cookies,” meaning that there could be any number from 3 to 22 left in 1 bag. Looking back, we think a clearer translation of the original question is as follows: ",106,mtms2012-09-68a,,
"There are 10 identical bags of cookies. If 23 people share  1 bag evenly, the minimum  number of cookies left from  1 bag is 3 cookies. What is the minimum number of cookies  left if all 10 bags are shared  evenly among these 23 people?",107,mtms2012-09-68a,,
"In Taiwan, all questions and their  official solutions from the Basic Competency Test are made available right after the exam is given. There is a set period of time when teachers and students can post an inquiry about a problem statement or about a test solution. All inquiries and official rulings are part of the public record. It turned out that quite a few inquiries about this item were received. Thirty-nine groups of teachers and students had submitted various arguments to support their claims that the correct solution for this problem should be “1 cookie.” Basically, all used reasoning similar to yours. However, the committee decided to keep the original solution “7 cookies.” What follows is a summary of their explanation. ",108,mtms2012-09-68a,,
"The committee stated that in real- life situations, as long as each of the 23 students receives the same number of cookies, it can be called “equal share,” which means that it is possible to have more than 23 cookies leftover. Thus, the test writers used the specific term for “the minimum number” to indicate that the cookies in the bag are shared in such a way as to have the minimum number of leftovers. It is important to note that the specific phrase “the minimum number” is used twice in the problem:  1.  In discussing the number of cookies left after 23 people share 1 bag  2.  In the question of how many  cookies will be left after sharing all  10 bags ",109,mtms2012-09-68a,,
"In ruling on the validity of the final solution of 1 cookie, the committee pointed out that this was the result of interpreting this particular phrase in two different ways and thus was not a valid solution. That is, in the first case (23 people sharing 1 bag) these individuals interpreted the phrase to mean “at least,” so there could be “3, 4, 5, . . . , up to 22 cookies” (and thus you could choose any number, not necessarily the minimum); however, in the second case (23 people sharing 10 bags), those same individuals interpreted the phrase to mean “the minimum value.” ",110,mtms2012-09-68a,,
We hope that the explanation above clarifies the issue. We find the transparent nature of the Basic Competency Test administration refreshing. Having timely as well as full access to the test itself appeared to create additional opportunities for mathematics discussion. ,111,mtms2012-09-68a,,
