7,Using History to Model with Mathematics: The German Tank Problem,"In Principles to Actions: Ensuring Mathematical Success for All, NCTM has provided the mathematics community with a research-informed framework of high-leverage teaching practices (2014). Among the teaching practices advocated is the use of tasks that encourage mathematical reasoning through problem solving. Simultaneously, current college and career readiness standards highlight the mathematical practices that students should develop. One such practice is modeling with mathematics, a process whereby students investigate situations by developing representations that are continually confirmed, revised, refined, or rejected (Lesh and Lehrer 2003). Like the other mathematical practices, modeling with mathematics is grounded in the process standards highlighted in Principles and Standards for School Mathematics (NCTM 2000) and the mathematical proficiencies identified in Adding It Up: Helping Children Learn Mathematics (Kilpatrick,  Swafford, and Findell 2001). Students who are adept in modeling with mathematics use mathematics to understand the world around them. This point of emphasis is consistent with the Problem Solving Standard that compels teachers to challenge their students to recognize and apply mathematics to solve problems that arise outside of mathematics (NCTM 2000). Modeling is also reflected in a student’s strategic competence, one of the five strands of mathematical proficiency that explores students’ formulation, representation, and solution of mathematical problems (Kilpatrick,  Swafford, and Findell 2001).

13,Using History to Model with Mathematics: The German Tank Problem,"The goal of this task was to challenge a class of seventh-grade students to create mathematical models that would allow them to estimate how many tanks were produced in a month based on randomly selected serial numbers that signified the captured tanks. We placed counters numbered from 1 to 342 in a bag to represent the total  number of tanks that were produced in August 1942 according to German military records (Ruggles and Brodie 1947). Then, one student from each group randomly selected 10 counters without replacement. We should note that we deliberately asked each group of students to randomly select 10 counters because the distribution of the data begins to emerge with a sample size of 10 (Moore 1990). Further, we conjectured that allowing each group of students to select their own counters would allow them to generate representations that they then could discuss, debate, and refine as a whole group later in the class session. Additionally, we purposefully did not tell students the total number of counters that were in the bag in case they were enticed to infer the total tanks produced from their samples.",13,Using History to Model with Mathematics: The German Tank Problem

Moreover, students were able to develop meaning in a situation in which all the information needed is not readily available. Herein lies the underlying challenge in this task: We wanted students to explore a limited number of captured tanks to generate their mathematical models, and as small a number as it is, having only 10 captured tanks is a real-life scenario. We wanted students to reason even when they did not have optimal conditions. More important, the variability in the data compelled students to use statistical reasoning. One underlying learning goal that we hoped students would achieve through engaging with this challenging task was to recognize and understand that “data are not just numbers, they are numbers with a context” (Franklin et al. 2007, p. 7) Although this task was initially demanding for the students, we found that giving them less information allowed them to grapple with  statistical reasoning in ways that many had not yet experienced.

113,Using History to Model with Mathematics: The German Tank Problem,"Additionally, fi gure 7 clearly  demonstrates the variability for the estimates is much less using the “minimum plus maximum” models instead of the models using 2 × a measure of center. (Note that the horizontal line in fi g. 7 denotes the true number of tanks, 342.) Therefore, in our case, using the “minimum plus maximum”  models are the better choice, since we have less chance of grossly overestimating or underestimating the true number of tanks.",113,Using History to Model with Mathematics: The German Tank Problem
114,Using History to Model with Mathematics: The German Tank Problem,"Of course, the distribution of the  estimates generated could be calculated using statistical theory. However, by  having students explore graphical representations like those in fi gures 6 and 7, they can examine the distributions of each model without having knowledge of advanced statistical theory and methods. To demonstrate the idea of simulation to a middle school student,  we find the simulation tool at NCTM’s Common Core Tools to be very illustrative (http://www.nctm.org/core mathtools/). Once students grasp the idea of simulation using a “one at a time” exploration, the teacher could display the graphical representations from this article to investigate where their estimates fell in the distribution.

116,Using History to Model with Mathematics: The German Tank Problem,"Students who are adept in modeling with mathematics have the capability to use mathematics in situations that arise in everyday life. The German Tank problem created the expectation that student reasoning was rooted in logical deductions (NCTM 2000). By engaging in this problem, students grappled with challenging mathematics in which they assumed the role of analysts creating mathematical models to understand historical events that influenced strategic planning during World War II. This interdisciplinary task provided students with the opportunity to see data as more than just numbers, but numbers with meaning that can have a substantial impact on the decisions affecting and influencing real-world outcomes.
