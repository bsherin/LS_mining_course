NAVIGATING CHANGE,103,mtms2011-12-260a,,
"I read Lindsay M. Umbeck’s article “Navigating Classroom Change” in the September 2011 issue (pp. 88−95) and want to share my whole-hearted “Yeah!” Two aspects of the article resonate with me: 1.  The modality shift from teacher/ curriculum-driven teaching to student-centered learning. The article positively shows the transformation of students from exploring to making effort to learning to owning knowledge to empowerment.  2.  The author’s own self-discovery journey  as a “true” math educator. I can only imagine the tenacity and efforts that have taken the author to break down the existing culture in the school, to overcome students’ preset study habits and learning styles, and to pursue a different vision of teaching. ",104,mtms2011-12-260a,,
"I am a math curriculum developer  by profession and math enthusiast/ educator by hobby. I formed a Math Circle program in Indianapolis (www.pi-math.org) to provide middle schoolers with alternative views of mathematics—as a subject that is beautiful, challenging, and rewarding. This article is a fresh breeze in the  math education ﬁ eld, and its tenets give a ﬁ rm nod of encouragement to similar initiatives like my own. ",105,mtms2011-12-260a,,

A COOKIE PROBLEM?,110,mtms2011-12-260a,,
"I just got my latest issue of MTMS. Right there on the front cover, a mistake! It says that Maura’s share is 4/5 but only 6 out of the 10 cookies are circled. Isn’t that 3/5? But wait! The focus of this magazine is on division of fractions. If 6 cookies are only 4/5 of Maura’s share, what would be Maura’s share? Ah, now that is a division problem! ",111,mtms2011-12-260a,,

ANOTHER COOKIE VIEW,115,mtms2011-12-260a,,
"After receiving my MTMS October 2011 journal, I see that pictured on the cover is a smiling young girl holding a tray of cookies. A portion of her share is outlined in white. I thought, “Great! I am just getting ready to teach fractions in my Math for Elementary Teachers course, so I can’t wait to use this.” Then I did a double take. If these 10 cookies represent Maura’s whole share, then shouldn’t there be 8 cookies circled instead of 6? One could calculate 4/5 of 10 using multiplication of fractions or simply note that if we divide the cookies on the sheet into 5 groups, each group contains 2 cookies; thus, 4/5 represents 4 groups of 2, or 8 cookies. ",116,mtms2011-12-260a,,
"On the other hand, perhaps the  cookie sheet does not represent all of Maura’s share, but rather the universal set of cookies available to all who might be eating them. In this case, the question becomes: “How many  cookies are in Maura’s full share if 4/5 of her share is 6 cookies?” This much more complicated problem can be solved algebraically by computing 6 = (4/5)m to get 7 1/2. ",117,mtms2011-12-260a,,
"For elementary students, this problem could also be approached by drawing 6 cookies, which represent 4/5 of Maura’s share. How many cookies are in 1/5 of the share? Splitting the cookies into 4 groups, we ﬁ nd that each ﬁ fth has 1 1/2 cookies in it (see ﬁ g. 1). Maura’s full share is 5/5. We already know that 4/5 is 6 cookies, so we just need to add one more ﬁ fth, or 1 1/2 cookies. Therefore, there are 6 + 1 1/2, or 7 1/2, cookies in her full share.",118,mtms2011-12-260a,,
"If you continue further into the issue, you will ﬁ nd that this type of problem is addressed in the cover story, “Take a Bite out of Fraction Division.” Perhaps it would have been clearer had there been a different number of cookies on the sheet than 10 or the total number of cookies hidden. Readers might not have assumed that they were all for Maura. ",119,mtms2011-12-260a,,

MTMS Editorial Panel,122,mtms2011-12-260a,,
Ed. note: It was not our intention for the 10 visible cookies to be taken into account. We believe that the question “What is the whole if 4/5 of a share is 6 cookies?” is more compelling for a middle school classroom than circling 3/5 of 10. ,123,mtms2011-12-260a,,
