"There are two primary interpretations of the mean: as a leveler of data (Uccellini 1996, pp. 113−114) and as a balance point of a data set. Typically, both interpretations of the mean are ignored in elementary school and middle school curricula. They are replaced with a rote ",4,mtms2012-10-148a,,

"When students are asked why the mean is an important number descriptor of a data set, they typically respond, “because it uses all of the numbers when you calculate it.” They rarely demonstrate any  conceptual understanding of the term or its properties. The activity in this article is a student-centered sequence of tasks that develops the interpretation of the mean as the balance point of a set of data. It also allows students to discover the following characteristics:  •  The mean is a value located between the maximum and minimum values of the data set.",13,mtms2012-10-148a,,
•  The mean does not have to be a  member of the data set.,14,mtms2012-10-148a,,
"•  For any data set, the sum of the  signed distances of numbers from the mean of the data set is zero. ",15,mtms2012-10-148a,,
"The activity has two parts. First,  students work through a sequence of hands-on tasks requiring them to balance a set of cubes on a ruler-andfulcrum seesaw. These actions are equivalent to constructing data sets, each with a mean of 6, and require students to consider each data point’s distance from the mean. Ideas developed during this pursuit are then used in the second part of the activity when students determine the mean  of small data sets. This sequence of tasks can be completed within one extended period or two typical class periods. ",16,mtms2012-10-148a,,
PART 1: COMPARING DISTANCES WITH THE MEAN,17,mtms2012-10-148a,,
"We have found that the tools for this activity, sturdy plastic rulers and 1-inch or 1/2-inch wooden cubes, work very well. Give each student a 12-inch ruler, a rhombus pattern cube ",18,mtms2012-10-148a,,
Fig. 1 This seesaw ruler gives students visual support for the concept of the balance point.,19,mtms2012-10-148a,,
"Fig. 2 When asked to arrange the cubes so that they are balanced, students will often place the cubes symmetrically on either side of the balance point, or fulcrum.",20,mtms2012-10-148a,,
"(a) Using two unique locations (b) Stacking cubes (c) Placing an additional cube on the fulcrum to use as a fulcrum, and ﬁ ve 1/2-inch wooden cubes. Direct students to ﬁ nd the fulcrum by placing the largest face of the rhombus ﬂ at on the table. Construct a seesaw by balancing the 12-inch ruler on the rhombus, centering the fulcrum of the seesaw on the 6-inch mark (see ﬁ g. 1). They should then conﬁ rm that their rulers are indeed balanced by comparing the distances between the tabletop and each of the opposing ends of the ruler. They should appear equivalent. ",21,mtms2012-10-148a,,
"The activity is completed in six  tasks, which are presented below. Rationales, possible student responses, and relevant discussion points are also provided. ",22,mtms2012-10-148a,,
"Task 1: Generate a balanced seesaw. Place four 1/2-inch cubes on the seesaw and center each cube on the inch marking on the ruler. When you have a cube arrangement that balances the seesaw, record your work.",23,mtms2012-10-148a,,
"Using a systematic or exploratory approach, students quickly produce a variety of cube arrangements that balance the seesaw. Most students create a symmetric arrangement, placing an equal number of cubes on both sides of the fulcrum (see ﬁ g. 2a). Others produce a nonsymmetric arrangement that balances, but they cannot describe a particular strategy (e.g., “It just worked!”) Asking students to share their arrangements and arrangement strategies typically produces responses similar to this:   I put one cube on the 8, and since that is two past the middle, I put another cube on the 4, since that is two before the middle. The two cubes balance each other. I did the same with 1 and 11.",24,mtms2012-10-148a,,
"When students calculate the mean of their different four-member data sets,  they are surprised to see that all the data sets have a mean equal to 6. At this point, mention to students that the activity is going to develop ideas related to the mean as a balance point of a data set. ",25,mtms2012-10-148a,,
The purpose of the second task is to encourage students to observe that stacking the cubes also produces balanced arrangements. This scenario corresponds to data sets with repeated values. ,26,mtms2012-10-148a,,
Task 2: Complete a balanced seesaw. Lisa started to balance her seesaw by stacking two cubes on the 9. Place the remaining two cubes so that the seesaw is balanced. ,27,mtms2012-10-148a,,
"Again, it is likely that students will want to preserve symmetry, so they commonly stack two cubes on the 3 (see ﬁ g. 2b). Having one or two students share the reasoning behind their arrangement strategy is usually sufﬁ cient to highlight the importance of balancing the cubes’ distances from the fulcrum. Students again link their cube conﬁ guration to its corresponding data set and conﬁ rm that the mean of this data set is also 6. ",28,mtms2012-10-148a,,
"An important property of the  mean is that it does not have to be a member of the data set it is describing; this property is a problematic notion for students who are trying to understand the mean. That issue is bypassed in this sequence of tasks since students typically begin creating cube arrangements in which no cube is placed over the fulcrum; hence, they are creating distributions from the start in which the mean is not a member. In fact, we found it necessary to deliberately provoke including a cube on the fulcrum by asking a question like that posed in task 3.",29,mtms2012-10-148a,,
Task 3: Add a value without changing the mean. Reconﬁ gure your four cubes into an arrange-,30,mtms2012-10-148a,,
"When students use cubes to balance a ruler, they develop a deep understanding of the mean.",31,mtms2012-10-148a,,
"Some students may attempt to determine the position of the  fulcrum by trial and  error, selecting a possible value and then calculating the sums of the distances of the points above  and below it.",32,mtms2012-10-148a,,
"ment that you have not used before, making sure to balance the seesaw. Without moving your four cubes, place a ﬁ fth cube so that your seesaw remains balanced. ",33,mtms2012-10-148a,,
"For all possible four-cube arrangements, the only workable ﬁ fth cube placement is directly on the fulcrum (see ﬁ g. 2c). It is important to discuss the implications of this result, aided by various prompts:  •  If we have a balanced cube arrangement, will placing a cube on the fulcrum always preserve the balance? Why, or why not?  •  If we have a balanced cube  arrangement with a cube on the fulcrum, how will removing that cube impact the balance?",34,mtms2012-10-148a,,
"Fig. 3 Using three cubes forces students to consider nonsymmetrical arrangements. One approach is to place one cube on one side, which limits the options for the location of the other two cubes on the other side.",35,mtms2012-10-148a,,
"(a) Speciﬁ c case (b) General case •  If we have an unbalanced cube  arrangement, will placing a cube on the fulcrum balance the seesaw? Why, or why not? ",36,mtms2012-10-148a,,
"By this point, most student responses focus on the distance that a cube is from the fulcrum. Since a cube placed directly on the fulcrum is not above or below it, its placement does not need to be counterbalanced with another cube. Therefore, a balanced cube arrangement remains balanced when a cube is placed on the fulcrum. Discuss equivalency and explain why removing a cube placed on the fulcrum does not impact a previously balanced arrangement. Finally, students see that placing a cube on the fulcrum contributes nothing toward balancing an unbalanced arrangement since it does not provide the missing counterbalance. ",37,mtms2012-10-148a,,
"Placing the ﬁ fth cube on the  fulcrum preserves the comfortable symmetry of the original cube arrangement, so our next task challenges students to design a balanced cube arrangement that is not symmetric about the fulcrum. To increase the likelihood of students ﬁ nding a working arrangement (even if by chance) and to make the underlying pattern transparent, we reduce the number of cubes to three, the smallest number that will produce nonsymmetric solutions. ",38,mtms2012-10-148a,,
Task 4: Find a nonsymmetric arrangement. Arrange three cubes into a nonsymmetrical arrangement that balances the seesaw. You may not place a cube on the fulcrum. ,39,mtms2012-10-148a,,
Constructing this triad challenges many students because they have not separated the notion of a balanced arrangement from that of a symmetrical arrangement. The three possible approaches that students demonstrate as they search for a triad are described below. ,40,mtms2012-10-148a,,
Approach 1: Students place a single cube on the seesaw and then determine the placement of the remaining two cubes.,41,mtms2012-10-148a,,
"Consider a cube placed 5 units below the fulcrum. A nonsymmetrical arrangement requires decomposing 5 into a pair of addends, say 2 + 3, and then placing the two remaining cubes 2 units and 3 units above the fulcrum (see ﬁ g. 3a). A student who discovers this relationship explains that “I put the cube 5 units from the fulcrum; 5 is equal to 2 plus 3. So I put two cubes on the other side, 2 and 3 units away from the fulcrum.” In general, this approach requires decomposing the distance, d1, represented on one side of the fulcrum by a cube, C1. This distance is divided into two smaller distances, d2 and d3, such that d2 + d3 = d1. On the opposite side are cubes C2 and C3 placed so that they are d2 and d3 units, respectively, from the fulcrum (see ﬁ g. 3b). ",42,mtms2012-10-148a,,
Approach 2: Students place two cubes on the same side of the fulcrum and then determine placement of the third cube.,43,mtms2012-10-148a,,
"For example, students place two cubes 2 units and 3 units above the fulcrum. Since 2 + 3 = 5, they place the third cube 5 units below the fulcrum. One student remarks that “I put two cubes on the same side of the fulcrum. One cube is 3 units from the fulcrum, and ",44,mtms2012-10-148a,,
"Students confuse  the distance  that a number is from the mean with the value of  the number.  the other is 2 units away. Altogether, that is a total of 5 units from the fulcrum. So I placed the third cube on the other side of the fulcrum, 5 units from it.” In general, this approach requires combining the two distances, d2 and d3, of the two cubes C2 and C3, placed on the same side of the fulcrum, to create a total distance, d1, which is then represented by a single cube C1, placed d1 units from the fulcrum on the opposite side.",45,mtms2012-10-148a,,
Approach 3: Students place a cube on both sides of the fulcrum and then determine the placement of the third cube.,46,mtms2012-10-148a,,
"For example, a student places a cube 3 units above the fulcrum and a second cube 5 units below the fulcrum. Since 3 < 5 and 5 − 3 = 2, the student places a second cube 2 units above the fulcrum. A student may justify, “I put one cube 3 units past the fulcrum and another cube 5 units before the fulcrum. I need another cube 2 units past the fulcrum.” In general, if cubes C1 and C3 with d3 < d1 are placed on opposite sides of the fulcrum, then C2 must be placed on the side with C3 a distance of d2 = d1 − d3 units from the fulcrum. ",47,mtms2012-10-148a,,
Task 4 forces students to rethink  two of their existing ideas:  1.  The necessity for individual  distances on either side of the fulcrum to match in a one-to-one correspondence ,48,mtms2012-10-148a,,
Fig. 4 This activity helps students understand that the sum of all the distances of cubes from the fulcrum on one side must equal the sum of all the distances of cubes from the fulcrum on the other side.,49,mtms2012-10-148a,,
2.  To recognize the important role of  the decomposed distances ,50,mtms2012-10-148a,,
"However, the idea that distances of cubes from the fulcrum can be decomposed and composed is sometimes misunderstood. Using the physical materials allows students to selfcorrect when they make a common mistake, which has been described in some studies of students’ thinking about the mean: Students confuse the distance a number is from the mean with the value of the number. For example, when constructing a triad with a mean of 6, a student might select 8, 5, and 3, because 5 + 3 = 8, and 5 and 3 are on one side of the fulcrum (6), and 8 is on the other. They have balanced the totals of the numbers on either side of the mean, not the distances, and therefore have not created a data set that has a mean of 6. For  students so inclined, using the algorithm to compute the mean is the only way to realize that their data set is incorrect. Using the physical seesaw immediately demonstrates that cubes placed at 8, 5, and 3 will not balance around the 6, thereby forcing students to modify their reasoning and strategy.",51,mtms2012-10-148a,,
Task 5 (see ﬁ g. 4) moves students toward our ﬁ nal goal in using these materials: To recognize and apply the principle that the sum of all the distances of cubes from the fulcrum on one side must equal the sum of all the distances of cubes from the fulcrum on the other side.,52,mtms2012-10-148a,,
Task 5: Adding one cube to ﬁ nd balance. Recreate each of the unbalanced seesaws in ﬁ gure 4 with your materials. Balance each seesaw by placing a single cube on the ruler. ,53,mtms2012-10-148a,,
"Item 5a in ﬁ gure 4 forces students to realize that a distance can be composed of more than two subdistances, in this case, three. Item 5b in ﬁ gure 4 forces students to move beyond thinking of balancing a particular cube by carefully placing two or more cubes, and to consider instead the total sums  on each side of the fulcrum. Students realize that the left-hand-side distances from the fulcrum sum to 10, whereas right-hand-side distances sum to 6. Therefore, a cube is needed 4 units above the fulcrum, on the 10. Task 5c from ﬁ gure 4 assesses whether students have mastered the ",54,mtms2012-10-148a,,
Fig. 5 Students disrupt the balance by moving a cube on the left side and restore the balance by moving a cube on the right side.,55,mtms2012-10-148a,,
"Fig. 6 When the location of a set of blocks is given, students are asked to determine the location of the fulcrum. By moving the blocks equal distances, they can stack them at the fulcrum.",56,mtms2012-10-148a,,
"(a)  (b)  (c)  concept of equating left-hand-side total distances from the fulcrum with right-hand-side total distances from the fulcrum. By now, students have generally mastered this idea. ",57,mtms2012-10-148a,,
Task 6: Rearranging cubes and maintaining balance. Represent the balanced data set in ﬁ gure 5 on your seesaw. Choose any cube on the left-hand side of the fulcrum and move it to a new location on the same side of the fulcrum. This move disrupts the balance of the data set. Describe a corresponding move of any single cube on the right-hand side of the fulcrum that rebalances the arrangement. ,58,mtms2012-10-148a,,
"Task 6 transforms a given data set with a mean of 6 into a different data set with a mean of 6 by balancing a move of a single data point on one side of the fulcrum with a corresponding move on the other side of the fulcrum. For example, if the cube on 4 is moved one cube up to 5, then the original distance of 2 units below the mean is replaced by a distance of 1 unit below the mean. This move decreases the sum of the distances of the data points below the mean by 1 unit. ",59,mtms2012-10-148a,,
"Since the sum of the distances of the data points below the mean must equal the sum of the distances of the data points above the mean, it is necessary to decrease the sum of the distances of the data points above the mean by 1 unit. Students need to make two important observations:  1.  Many different data sets are produced by a balanced pair of moves.",60,mtms2012-10-148a,,
2.  A balanced pair of moves preserves  the mean. ,61,mtms2012-10-148a,,
"At this point, we move away from  materials that limit our data sets to those with a known mean of 6 and apply our new understandings to  determine an unknown mean of small data sets (without using the standard algorithm for calculating the mean). ",62,mtms2012-10-148a,,
PART 2: DETERMINING THE MEAN OF A DATA SET,63,mtms2012-10-148a,,
"Give students a paper number line and a handful of small centimeter blocks (similar to those used for place-value). Point out that we do not know our mean; therefore, we do not have a visible fulcrum. Have students represent the data set 5, 9, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14 by placing a block for each data point on the number line (see ﬁ g. 6a). Ask students to estimate the location of the missing fulcrum. Responses should indicate, at the very least, that the fulcrum should be placed somewhere between the smallest value, 5, and the largest value, 14. It is important to highlight this observation, including discussion of why it would not make sense for the mean to be located below the 5 or above the 14.",64,mtms2012-10-148a,,
"Some students may attempt to  determine the position of the fulcrum by trial and error, selecting a possible value and then calculating the sums of the distances of the points above and below it. This is a desirable response in that it clearly incorporates the learning outcomes of part 1 of this activity. However, it can prove tedious. A more systematic approach using the balanced moves from task 6 is valuable. ",65,mtms2012-10-148a,,
"Imagine the fulcrum placed somewhere between the minimum and maximum value such that the given arrangement is balanced. If we were to move 1 data point, say, the block representing the 5 in ﬁ gure 6a, up 3 units to the 8, we would have to move a block on the other side of the fulcrum down 3 units. Since we do not know the exact placement of the fulcrum, students typically suggest moving one of the extreme values down ",66,mtms2012-10-148a,,
An important property of the  mean is that it does  not have to be a  member of the data set it is describing.,67,mtms2012-10-148a,,
"3 units, say, moving the 14 down 3 units to the 11. This produces a new data set with the same unknown mean (see ﬁ g. 6b): 8, 9, 9, 10, 11, 11, 12. It is important for students to observe that this sequence of jumps has narrowed the interval including the unknown mean from between 5 and 14 to between 8 and 11. Have students continue making pairs of balanced jumps, hence, continuing to narrow the interval containing the mean, until all their blocks are stacked on the same number (see ﬁ g. 6c). Ask students to explain why that number must be the mean. ",68,mtms2012-10-148a,,
THE POWER OF AN ALTERNATIVE METHOD,69,mtms2012-10-148a,,
"Completing this sequence of tasks allows students to develop a meaningful understanding of the mean as a balance point of a data set. Given the ubiquitous nature of this important statistic, we owe our students the opportunity to explore all its characteristics and derive alternate methods of ﬁ nding it on the basis of those characteristics.
