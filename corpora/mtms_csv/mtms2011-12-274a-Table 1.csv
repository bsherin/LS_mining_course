For example, given a list of twenty numbers, a student is asked to graph and find measures of central tendency. Without knowing what the data represent and what questions would be answered with the analysis, the exercise is simply procedural mathematics and numerical data are just numbers. Placing the numbers in a real-world context invites thought beyond procedure and the potential for greater insight and reasoning.",5,mtms2011-12-274a,,

Additional background on energy, macronutrients, and water as well as quantitative data on the energy and nutrient composition of food are available in nutrition textbooks (e.g., Insel, Turner, and Ross 2010) and online (see Institute of Medicine 2002/2005 and  U.S. Department of Agriculture).

"This topic relates to the energy provided by the nutrients of fats, carbohydrates, and proteins (known as macronutrients) as well as the nutrient of greatest importance to survival: water (Insel, Turner, and Ross 2010). The energy of food is measured in kilocalories, or kcal. The energy available to consumers from these macronutrients varies: The measure for fat is approximately 9 kcal/gram (g), and the measure for carbohydrates and proteins is 4 kcal/g.

"For an example of kcal, see the nutritional information for a one-ounce serving of cheddar cheese, shown in fi gure 2. In common usage and on nutrition labels, kilocalories are referred to as calories. On the basis of the approximate energy contribution per gram of these macronutrients, the fat (which includes oil) content of a food has a substantially greater infl uence on the energy value of that food  than the carbohydrate (e.g., sugar and starch) and protein (amino acids) content of the food.
