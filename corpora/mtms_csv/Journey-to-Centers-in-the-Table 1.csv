1,Journey to Centers in the Core - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"$25,346; $27,834;",,
2,Journey to Centers in the Core - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"$31,763; $32,527; $96,941",,
3,Journey to Centers in the Core - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Imagine that the owner of the company is trying to recruit new workers. To impress applicants, the owner claims that the typical annual employee salary is $42,882.20. The owner of a competing company hears this and argues that the typical salary is actually $31,763. Hearing these contradictory claims, applicants are left to decide: Which value is a more accurate descriptor of the typical salary?",,
4,Journey to Centers in the Core - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The salary scenario is just one example of the necessity of thinking about which measure of center best represents a data set. One person used the mean ($42,882.20) as a description of typical value; the other used the median ($31,763). Considerable discrepancies between the mean and median often occur in data sets that are skewed left, skewed right, or have other unusual features. In such cases, it is important to analyze the data and context carefully to decide how best to describe centers of distributions. The importance of this type of statistical thinking is acknowledged in the grade 6 Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSM) (CCSSI 2010): Students are to engage in relating the choice of measures of center and variability to the shape of the data distribution and the context in which the data were gathered (CCSSI 2010, p. 45).",,
5,Journey to Centers in the Core - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Choosing an appropriate measure of center for data is a nontrivial matter for students, as illustrated by data from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). The NAEP item shown in figure 1 was administered to a national sample of eighth graders. For a response to be considered correct, students had to state that the median was a better description of center because the mean is lowered by one low data value. Only 6 percent of the eighth graders taking the 2007 NAEP gave correct responses. Another 6 percent omitted the item, 21 percent gave partially correct responses, and 67 percent gave incorrect responses (U.S. Department of Education 2014). These results are especially alarming in that they are from eighth graders, since the CCSSM expectation is for sixth-grade students to choose appropriate measures of center for data sets.",,

7,Journey to Centers in the Core - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,A STUDY TO INVESTIGATE STUDENTS REASONING ABOUT CENTERS,,
8,Journey to Centers in the Core - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Given the steep challenge set in the grade 6 CCSSM, we set out to investigate how students reasoning about choosing appropriate measures of center might be developed. We conducted a classroom research study during a summer mathematics program funded by the National Science Foundation. The study focused on a small group of students: two females and two males. We will refer to them as Shonice, Emily, Joseph, and DuJuan (all pseudonyms). All four students were finishing fifth grade and moving on to sixth grade. Shonice, Emily, and DuJuan attended schools that had adopted the CCSSM. Joseph was home-schooled and studied a traditional mathematics curriculum.",,
9,Journey to Centers in the Core - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Our study involved intensive data gathering and analysis over nine weeks. The study method is summarized in figure 2. We met with the students for one hour each week. During week 1, we conducted and videorecorded individual clinical interviews to determine how the students initially reasoned about measures of center and distributions. We then used what we learned during the interviews to design an appropriate week 2 lesson. The week 2 lesson was videorecorded, transcribed, and analyzed so that the week 3 lesson could be designed to address and extend the reasoning that students had exhibited. The process of videorecording each lesson, analyzing it, and using the data to design the next lesson continued through week 8. During week 9,we once again conducted clinical interviews with students to assess the extent of their learning. In this article, we share the lessons we learned about developing students abilities to choose appropriate measures of center.",,
10,Journey to Centers in the Core - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
11,Journey to Centers in the Core - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Week 1: Preassessment Interviews,,
12,Journey to Centers in the Core - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Three of the preassessment interview tasks we administered provided exceptionally rich information about students thinking. One such task required students to summarize a data set of puppy birth weights using a graph and determine a typical value (see fig. 3).,,
13,Journey to Centers in the Core - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
14,Journey to Centers in the Core - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,All four students responded differently. Emily and Joseph constructed displays that aggregated the data (see fig. 4).,,
15,Journey to Centers in the Core - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
16,Journey to Centers in the Core - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Josephs work resembled a histogram with horizontal bars; Emilys representation was a conventional line plot. Both students described the typical birth weight in terms of the tallest stack on their graphs. Shonice and DuJuan, on the other hand, constructed displays that did not aggregate the data (see fig. 5).In Shonices display, each data value was given its own bar. The first several bars in her display are shown in figure 5. The first bar reaches 13 because the first data value in the task was 13, and so on. When asked to describe the typical birth weight, Shonice opted for the largest value in the data set. DuJuans graphical display resembled a number line. Each data value had its own hash mark. When asked to determine a typical birth weight, he did not examine the data but instead used only his personal background knowledge.",,
17,Journey to Centers in the Core - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
18,Journey to Centers in the Core - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"DuJuans response to the puppy weight task was perhaps the most interesting of the four. As mentioned, he constructed the graph shown in figure 5 in response to part (a) of the task, which required a graph to summarize the birth weights. Then, in response to part (b), which required describing the center of the data, he counted the number of data points to try to identify the one directly in the middle and circled 17 as an approximation of center (i.e., he intuitively looked for the median when asked to locate the center). However, when asked to describe the typical birth weight in part (c), he responded, More than 20 pounds. When the interviewer asked him to explain, he said, When a dog is born, when a dog is a puppy, it weighs 5 pounds. The interviewer then prompted him to look to the data to form his answer. After examining the data again, DuJuan said, Fifteen because it is getting a little heavier, rather than using the center of 17 he identified earlier. DuJuans comments indicated that he had not begun to associate the idea of center of a data set with typical value.",,
19,Journey to Centers in the Core - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In another task (see fig. 6), students were given dot plots showing height distributions for eight-year-olds and ten-year-olds (Common Core State Standards Writing Team 2011, p. 13). They were to describe the typical height for each age group. As in the previous task, Joseph and Emily tried to find the tallest stack of dots for each group to describe typical height. Shonice again focused on the largest value in the data set as the typical height. DuJuan considered the length of the horizontal axis to be the typical value, further confirming his inclination toward number linelike representations (as in fig. 5).",,
20,Journey to Centers in the Core - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
21,Journey to Centers in the Core - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In a third task, students displayed reasoning contrasting with their responses to the previous two items. This task, from the 1996 NAEP, asked students to determine typical values for attendance in two movie theatres (see fig. 7). Students had to choose between the mean and median. Joseph and Shonice focused on the closeness of each statistic to the main cluster of data. For example, when asked to describe the typical daily attendance for theatre A, Joseph chose the median, saying, All of these numbers are closer to 90. Emily, on the other hand, looked for the statistic that was closest to the maximum value in each data set. DuJuan did not take the lists of data into consideration at all, instead choosing the median because it orders the data from least to greatest.",,
22,Journey to Centers in the Core - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
23,Journey to Centers in the Core - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Weeks 23: Building Aggregate Data Displays,,
24,Journey to Centers in the Core - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"According to the Common Core State Standards Writing Team (2011), constructing aggregate displays is an essential stepping-stone toward examining distribution characteristics such as center and spread. Since our ultimate goal was to help students choose measures of center to best describe typical values, a top priority in the first two lessons was to help them become comfortable with aggregate displays. During the first lesson, we had students roll pairs of dice several times, record the sums produced, and construct a graph to show the sums. When we observed Emily using a dot plot to summarize the data, we asked her to share her strategy with the others so that they could become familiar with this conventional representation for displaying aggregate data. We then asked students to work together to construct a display on the classroom whiteboard, using Emilys strategy with sticky notes for the dots. Students quickly understood this strategy for graphing, so we asked them to use dot plots to organize data in subsequent tasks as well.",,
25,Journey to Centers in the Core - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"With such dot plots, students began to focus on attributes that could be used to describe the centers, or typical values, of distributions. For example, during the second lesson, DuJuan started to talk about places in which the data were squished together when using a dot plot to organize data on text messages sent by students (see fig. 8). He and others also focused on where the tallest stack of data occurred when they were asked to describe the typical value.",,
26,Journey to Centers in the Core - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
27,Journey to Centers in the Core - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Weeks 45: Expanding Strategies for Describing Typical Values,,
28,Journey to Centers in the Core - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"During the first two lessons, students focused so much on the tallest stack of data to describe typical values that we wanted to challenge them to think about situations where the tallest stack might not be a good descriptor of typical value. We revisited rolling dice and recording the sums generated. This time, however, one student was given a pair of dice weighted to produce a sum of 12 repeatedly. We pooled the sums from the weighted dice with the sums from fair dice by using TinkerPlots (Konold and Miller 2005) to produce the graph shown in figure 9. We asked students where the data seemed to be squished together or clustered (building on DuJuans informal language) and how those numbers compared with the location of the tallest stack of data. TinkerPlots dividers were used to highlight the main cluster, as shown in figure 9. Students observed that since one pair of dice was weighted, the tallest stack in the dot plot was misleading in describing sums typically obtained from rolling dice.",,
29,Journey to Centers in the Core - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
30,Journey to Centers in the Core - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We continued to use TinkerPlots to organize data in dot plots and identify central clusters during the next lesson. One task in the next lesson compared the heights of players on two basketball teams. We projected the graphs shown in figure 10 on a whiteboard to make it easy for students to circle central clusters of data in each distribution. We also asked them to locate the median of each distribution by crossing off dots on each side of each dot plot until arriving at the middle. Finally, we asked them to observe where the median fell in relation to the clusters they had identified. In doing so, students began to associate the median with the locations of central clusters.",,
31,Journey to Centers in the Core - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
32,Journey to Centers in the Core - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Weeks 68: Choosing among Mean, Median, and Mode",,
33,Journey to Centers in the Core - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In the first four lessons, students began to associate the ideas of central cluster, median, and tallest (i.e., modal) stack with the notion of typical value. In accord with CCSSM expectations, we wanted students to understand the mean as being another potential descriptor of typical value. We introduced the mean conceptually as a fair share with a Connected Mathematics activity (Lappan et al. 2004). Students were given a data set showing the number of members in five different families:",,
34,Journey to Centers in the Core - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"2, 3, 3, 6, 6.",,
35,Journey to Centers in the Core - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,They were to represent each data value with a stack of snap cubes (see fig. 11a). Students were then asked to redistribute the cubes among the 5 stacks so that each stack would have the same number of cubes (see fig. 11b).,,
36,Journey to Centers in the Core - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
37,Journey to Centers in the Core - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The number of cubes in each of the new stacks would be the mean, or fair share, value. This led to a discussion of how the mean could also be found by snapping all the stacks together and then breaking them back apart into 5 equal stacks. In doing that, one essentially adds all the data values together and divides by the number of values in the data set, justifying the conventional add and divide algorithm for the mean.",,
38,Journey to Centers in the Core - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"During the final lessons, and with the mean in play as another potential descriptor of typical value, we prompted students to compare the value of the mean with the median, mode, and central cluster of data. In the second-to-last lesson, for example, we distributed 24 candies so that a teacher received 19 and the others each received 1 candy. Students wrote the data set",,
39,Journey to Centers in the Core - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"19, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1",,
40,Journey to Centers in the Core - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"on the board in list form. When we asked how many candies the typical person had, students gave a variety of responses. Joseph opted for the mean; DuJuan and Emily, the mode; and Shonice chose the value midway between 1 and 19. This helped emphasize the idea that people might choose multiple methods for describing the center of a data set, and that the mean can differ sharply from other measures of center when outliers are present.",,
41,Journey to Centers in the Core - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We did not press students to come to a consensus or argue for one measure over another at this point; instead, we planned to engage students in discussions about choosing among measures of center during the next lesson. However, other teachers using this task may find it profitable to do so as time permits.",,
42,Journey to Centers in the Core - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In the final lesson, to elucidate the idea that some methods for describing center are more reasonable than others, we had students examine a data set showing the weekly income of individuals in a small town:",,
43,Journey to Centers in the Core - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"$0, $0, $0, $0, $0, $0, $0, $0,",,
44,Journey to Centers in the Core - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"$200, $200, $200, $200, $200,",,
45,Journey to Centers in the Core - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"$200, $200, $30,600",,
46,Journey to Centers in the Core - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"(Lappan et al. 2004, p. 59). In the lesson from which the data were drawn, students were told that candidates in the towns mayoral race had different ways of describing the towns average income. The sitting mayor claimed that the average income was $2,000 per week. A competing candidate claimed that it was $100, and another claimed that it was $0. Our students determined that the mayor had used the mean, whereas the challengers used median and mode. This realization helped solidify the idea that not all measures of center are always equally reasonable for describing typical value. At this point, it may also have been valuable to revisit the Candy problem to help students apply this realization to a familiar scenario. Time did not permit us, but it seems likely that other teachers using our sequence of tasks may find it beneficial to have students revisit that candy scenario.",,
47,Journey to Centers in the Core - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Week 9: Postassessment Interviews,,
48,Journey to Centers in the Core - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"At the end of our project, during individual postassessment clinical interviews, we noticed areas of growth for each student. When asked to produce a graph for the puppy weight task (see fig. 3), Joseph, DuJuan, and Shonice spontaneously used the aggregate dot-plot representation that Emily had shared at the outset of the project. These graphs were all constructed like Shonices graph, shown in figure 12, with the exception that Joseph used a dot for each data point rather than an X. Using her dot plot, Shonice described the typical value in terms of the central cluster of data, rather than the maximum value, as she had done in the preassessment interview. DuJuan used his dot plot and the modal stack to describe the typical value rather than ignoring the data entirely, as he had done during the preassessment.",,
49,Journey to Centers in the Core - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
50,Journey to Centers in the Core - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"DuJuan and Shonice also began to use their new strategies in response to the typical value item shown in figure 6 (the height comparison task). For example, when DuJuan was asked to describe the height of a typical eight-year-old, he said, Fifty-one because eight-year-olds heights are between 50 and 52, and I think 51 is the one because it is right in the middle. In response to the same question, Shonice said, I think like 50 or 52 because most of them are in that separate little group (referring to the cluster of data between 50 and 52). Similar growth was evident in students responses to the theatre task (see fig. 7). Emily, for example, shifted away from associating the maximum with the typical value to choosing a measure for center based on its closeness to the main cluster of data. When asked to choose between mean and median to represent the typical attendance at theatre A, Emily chose the median, explaining that most of them [the data values] are right there by 90. DuJuan adopted this strategy for the theatre task as well, justifying his choice of the median for theatre A by saying that most of the points are close to 90.",,
51,Journey to Centers in the Core - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,HELPING STUDENTS DEVELOP STRATEGIES,,
52,Journey to Centers in the Core - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Our small group of students taught us a great deal about how students perceive measures of center and how their reasoning might be developed. We found that it was important to begin by helping them develop strategies for displaying data in aggregate form. Once these representations were produced, we were able to draw their attention toward central clusters of data. They could then compare the locations of the central clusters against the values of the formal statistics of mean, median, and mode. Students saw that in many cases, one formal statistic provides a more reasonable one-number description of the central clusters location than the others. Helping students attain this understanding was a gradual process. We hope that ideas from our lesson sequence will help other teachers guide their students along the challenging path toward selecting appropriate measures of center for data distributions.",,
