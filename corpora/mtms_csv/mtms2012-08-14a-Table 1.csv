"Pete the Panther is the mascot for the Pineville Panthers football team. Each time the Panthers make a touchdown and an extra point (7 points) or kick a field goal (3 points) during a game, Pete does the same number of push-ups as the team’s score. For example, if the team scores a touchdown and the extra point and later in the game makes a field goal, Pete will do 7 pushups after the first score and 10 pushups (7 + 3) after the second score. In the last game, the Panthers scored 3 touchdowns (plus the extra point with each touchdown) and 2 field goals, in some order. What would be the greatest number of push-ups that Pete would have to do throughout an entire game? What would be the fewest number of pushups? Explain how you found your  answers.",3,mtms2012-08-14a,,

"Fig. 1 Jessica did not use a systematic process, so she needed to explore many possibilities before convincing herself of her solution.",6,mtms2012-08-14a,,
Fig. 2 Elijah’s systematic solution allowed him to find a pattern rather quickly.,7,mtms2012-08-14a,,
"Fig. 3 matan produced his four cases by calculating all the touchdowns, then trying all the field goals.  tTo solve this problem, students  needed to flex their mathematical muscles. Some students began investigating possible solutions by using guess and check, then employed their special cases to draw conclusions. The following examples of student work show the differences in the systematic or random test cases that students selected. They also illustrate the number of cases that students analyzed before they reached their conclusion.  (In the discussion below, assume  that “touchdown” is referring to a 6-point touchdown and a 1-point kick, totaling 7 points.)",8,mtms2012-08-14a,,
"Some students, such as seventh- grader Jessica, ordered the scores randomly. Jessica alternated between a touchdown and a field goal, then added the rest of the scores in no particular order (see fig. 1). When working in this way, seven trial cases were needed before she was convinced  that she had the greatest number and least number of push-ups possible. Although she did not list all ten ways that the scoring could have occurred, she needed a large number of trials to see the pattern that developed.",9,mtms2012-08-14a,,
"Others, such as sixth-grader Elijah,  worked in a slightly more systematic way. He produced five possibilities in which he grouped all the touchdowns and all the field goals together or alternated the two (see fig. 2). After  these five cases (his fifth case was a repeat of his third trial), he was able to see the pattern that occurred when analyzing the touchdowns first.",10,mtms2012-08-14a,,
"Sixth-grader Matan’s strategy was  similar to Elijah’s, but he arrived at his four cases more systematically. He tried all the touchdowns first, then all the field goals first, then moved one of the field goals between the touchdowns (see fig. 3). By the time he had completed four cases, he had reached his conclusion. Matan’s more systematic approach did not yield any duplicate trials. ",11,mtms2012-08-14a,,
"Eighth-grader Alex, however, attempted to work systematically in his approach to possible scores. He started with the field goals first, followed by all the touchdowns, then began moving one of the touchdowns forward between the two field goals. Next, he tried to move two touchdowns forward, one to the beginning and one between the two field goals (see fig. 4). After completing these three trials, he realized that listing the highest point totals first would allow him to get the largest number of push-ups. He then moved all the touchdowns to the start of the list of scores.",12,mtms2012-08-14a,,
alternative Questions,13,mtms2012-08-14a,,
"As we reflect on the task assigned and the solutions received, we realize that some alternative questions could have caused students to think more deeply about this task. ",14,mtms2012-08-14a,,
"First, we could have asked students to find all the possible ways in which scoring could have occurred, not just the ways that resulted in the greatest number and fewest number of push-ups. This revised task could have resulted in more systematic work from students as they developed their special cases, since they would have needed to find all the cases and avoid duplicates. Although the scoring could occur in 10 ways, only 7 different total numbers of push-ups would be possible. ",15,mtms2012-08-14a,,
"Fig. 4 Alex realized that by the time he had completed his three trials, he was going to find the greatest number of push-ups having the highest point totals first, so he moved all the touchdowns to the start of the list of scores.",16,mtms2012-08-14a,,
"This scenario leads to another  possible question in which we ask students to find all the different scoring sequences that would have resulted in a specific number of completed pushups. Since two scoring sequences could produce 77, 81, and 85 total push-ups for the game, any of those sequences could have been chosen. ",17,mtms2012-08-14a,,
"Students could also have been  told that the team scored five times, without specifying the total number of touchdowns or field goals, then asked, “What are all the possible number of ways that scoring could occur and the possible number of push-ups that Pete would have completed for each?” This scenario would have resulted in 32 possible scoring combinations and 16 possibilities for the number of push-ups. Finally, students could look at the  pattern in the number of possible scoring combinations on the basis of  the number of times the team scored. Any of these alterations to the original question would have resulted in additional thinking and reasoning and may have better connected the numeration to the ideas of outcomes and counting strategies. We encourage you to try some of these extensions with your students. ",18,mtms2012-08-14a,,
