"tors typically wear many hats.  Their many roles may include providing  professional  development (i.e., workshops) for practicing teachers  on  various  topics  (e.g.,  use of  technology,  teaching  English  Language  Learners);  teaching  mathematics or methods courses to teachers or teacher  candidates  enrolled  in  undergraduate  or  graduate  teacher  education programs; and working with various groups or entities related to policy ",4,mtms2007-05-488a,,

Although mathematics teacher educators contribute to the field in various ways, a perception exists that university faculty are in an “ivory tower,” having  few  or  ancient  connections  to schools. In some cases, their credibility may be questioned because of the time that  has  elapsed  since  they  were  in  a classroom full time. For example, when suggesting new pedagogical approaches  in  professional  development  contexts or university courses, it is not uncommon for participants to make these comments:  “Well,  things  are  different now”; “The students are not the same”; or “you don’t understand what they are asking us to do.” To function as leaders who  influence  the  direction  of  mathematics education, it is important that teacher educators remain grounded in the work of teachers, including the possible  impact  of  suggested  approaches on the nature of their work.

"Like  many  of  today’s  practicing mathematics teachers, university teacher  educators  often  learned  mathematics  in  an  environment  quite  different from  that  currently  recommended  by the NCTM. That is, teacher educators have  often  not  experienced  learning mathematics  or,  in  some  cases,  teaching through reform strategies that are advocated in their work with mathematics  teachers  and  students.  Therefore, it  is  important  that  university  teacher educators  demonstrate  that  they  are not  simply  talking  the  talk  related  to Standards-based  instruction  but  that they can walk the walk by working with ",7,mtms2007-05-488a,,
"Much  can  be  gained  by  talking  to teachers  and  observing  them  in  their classrooms. These experiences provide rich opportunities to formulate theories about  instruction,  to  question  current practices,  and  to  suggest  alternatives. However, such experiences do not give teacher educators the opportunities to implement these strategies themselves. Much can be gained when teacher educators work with students in classrooms and use the strategies that they are recommending. providing instruction in today’s educational climate yields insights into some of the concerns that teachers face, exposes teacher educators to pitfalls  (e.g.,  unmotivated  students)  that must  be  addressed,  and  demonstrates the validity and feasibility of suggested approaches.

"Because we believe that classroom connections  are  important,  we  have engaged in several projects with various  school  districts  in  Florida  that involve  teaching  regularly  in  middle school  mathematics  teachers’  classrooms. Typically, the goal is to model particular instructional  approaches, focusing on the development of such approaches  over  time,  or  to  test  the use of an innovative strategy. Because we are in the classroom on a regular basis, the novelty of having a guest in the room wears off, and we must address issues that teachers often face, including  discipline,  individual  learning  preferences,  and  special  needs (e.g.,  English  Language  Learners  or learning  disabilities).  In  addition,  we  must pay attention to the required curriculum and assessments that are part of the current high-stakes assessment environment. Overall, we have had to consider  strategies  and  approaches that  are  sustainable  over  an  entire school  year,  both  for  students  who cannot  handle  a  new  approach  every week and for teachers who need to use powerful  approaches  consistently  so that they become second nature.",9,mtms2007-05-488a,,
"These  classroom  experiences  are invaluable, as they have allowed us to make links to actual classrooms in the courses that we teach and in the professional development that we provide. By being in school classes regularly, we can share actual events with our preservice teachers that happened yesterday, last  week,  or  last  month,  rather  than provide  examples  from  ten  or  twenty years ago. We can discuss what to do when planned instruction does not occur  as  intended,  discuss  approaches that  were  used  to  address  particular students’  needs,  and  discuss  ways  to  address constraints within schools and school districts. The recent work in K– 12 classes provides a credibility factor with  teachers  and  teacher  candidates that  is  hard  to  obtain  any  other  way. Our discussions with teachers can address the particular reality they have or will likely experience in the classroom or provide alternatives for assumptions that are made. We have had teachers tell us, “you understand what it’s like,” especially when they believe their salary or their job is threatened by tests and  aspects  of  achievement  that  are outside of their control.",10,mtms2007-05-488a,,
"These  experiences  have  allowed us  to  build  strong  partnerships  with districts  and  schools.  Theoretical knowledge and practical context must peacefully co-exist. Although university teacher educators have many demands on  their  time,  such  as  writing  manuscripts  and  books,  making  presentations  at  conferences,  and  serving  on university  and  state  committees,  we believe  that  the  lessons  learned  from  teaching in classrooms and the ability to link to issues that are real to teachers are worth the invested time. Experience with these lessons have encouraged  teachers  to  attempt  approaches that  we  recommend.  So  to  those  university teacher educators who are not regularly in the classroom, we urge you to find a teacher, develop a partnership, and engage regularly with students. To those  mathematics  teachers  dealing with all the normal obligations and responsibilities of teaching mathematics to middle-grades students, we urge you to partner with a university mathematics teacher educator and explore ways to enhance the classroom teaching and learning experience. We have much to learn from each other. ",11,mtms2007-05-488a,,
