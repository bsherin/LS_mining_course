"Middle school students are often asked to generate a story to explain a graph of a piecewise function. Unfortunately, they often have had little experience translating among various representations of nonlinear functions. Van de Walle, Karp, and Bay-Williams (forthcoming) emphasize the importance of developing fluency moving among the various representations of functional relationships.  and their representations, we asked students to solve the Sneaking Up the Line task (EDC 2005, p. 348). It requires students to explore a pattern about how many jumps a sneaky sheep must make to get to the front of the line, depending on how many sheep start out ahead (fig. 1). The students completing the task included twelve middle school students and five university students. ",3,mtms2010-02-310a,,
"We presented the situation in  figure 1. To help students clarify the pattern, we asked these questions:  •	 How	often	does	Eric	move	ahead?	 •	 What	makes	the	number	of	sheep	 in front of Eric change?",4,mtms2010-02-310a,,
"We then asked students to predict the number of sheep that will be shorn before Eric and describe the strategies they used to find the number. Before completing it on their own, we worked through simpler versions of the task with the whole class by asking students if they could find how many sheep would be shorn before Eric if there were 6 or 11 sheep in front. All students were encouraged to use twocolor counters or color tiles to model these situations. Some students volunteered to act out the situation in front of the class. We recommend using the information from these simpler tasks to solve the original problem. ",5,mtms2010-02-310a,,
Students were then placed in pairs to work. We monitored their progress and asked these questions: ,6,mtms2010-02-310a,,
"Step functions are a completely different kind of pattern that may be unfamiliar to most middle-grades students. For this reason, these functions can be problematic when set in a context. However, Billings and McClure (2005) state that context is important for middle school students to develop a deep understanding of step-wise functional relationships. Working with these types of functions in middle school will help students develop a stronger understanding of functional relationships and their various representations. ",7,mtms2010-02-310a,,

"Students were asked to describe a rule or expression that they could use to find the number of sheep shorn before Eric for any number of sheep in front. The university students did not immediately generate tables and graphs depicting this relationship; we inferred that making the translation into a rule or expression was challenging for them. As a result, a table and a blank graph were added to the handout to provide additional scaffolding for the middle school students. After the task was completed, the class discussed solution strategies. Students were asked how the numbers in this pattern compared with other patterns they had studied.  stUdent PeRFoRMance",11,mtms2010-02-310a,,
"Both the middle school and university students used different strategies to predict the number of sheep shorn before Eric. Although the middle school students used an assortment of strategies, the most common was to divide by 2 (because Eric skipped 2 sheep each time). All university students took the number 3 into account for their predictions because Eric skipped 2 sheep and 1 was removed from the line. Their most common solution strategy was to divide 49 by 3. ",12,mtms2010-02-310a,,
"When working out the actual solution to the task, the middle school students used three common strategies:  •	 Modeling	with	49	counters	(a	 continuation of physically acting out the task)  •	 Drawing	a	diagram	and	marking	 off the shorn sheep as Eric moved up the line ",13,mtms2010-02-310a,,

"Most middle school students who used one or more of these strategies found the correct answer, which was that 17 sheep were shorn ahead of Eric. The next most popular answer was 16, as students struggled to keep an accurate count once Eric was within 3 sheep of being at the front of the line. In other words, when Eric became third in line, sheep 1 was shorn, but only 1 sheep remained to jump over. ",22,mtms2010-02-310a,,
"Similar confusion surfaced when  these students acted out the problem in class. A remainder became an unanticipated source of difficulty. How does one extend a pattern when it cannot be fully continued, and what does a remainder mean? It represented the number of sheep in front of Eric, but students interpreted it to mean a fraction of a sheep. In contrast, the university students did not have the same difficulty in deciding how to handle the remainders, as evidenced in the rules they recorded both symbolically (as shown in fig. 2) and verbally: ",23,mtms2010-02-310a,,
"The rule I used was the number of sheep divided by 3. If there was a remainder of 1 or 2, I rounded up.",24,mtms2010-02-310a,,
"Most students discussed dividing the number of sheep ahead of Eric by 3 and rounding up when the number was not evenly divisible by 3. However, two university students reasoned incorrectly about why they needed to round to “account for partial sheep”:",25,mtms2010-02-310a,,

"My prediction was correct, but the expression is more specific (i.e., rounding up to account for partial sheep).",30,mtms2010-02-310a,,
"In addition, most university students seemed to be overconfident in their ability to obtain a correct solution, so they jumped from their physical models to symbolic and verbal rules without generating tables and graphs of the pattern. ",31,mtms2010-02-310a,,
"None of the middle school students described the pattern in terms of division, but rather in terms of subtracting 1 and then subtracting 2  (fig. 3a). We believe that this is one reason the younger students had trouble finding a rule for any number of sheep. Simply recording their strategy with a picture was difficult for some (fig. 3b). In one case, a student made three drawings that resulted in three different answers (fig. 3a). We conjecture that this occurred because it was challenging to represent a dynamic pattern on paper with a static diagram. Those students who successfully used a table strategy continued to have difficulty when it came to writing a rule. For example, one student described his process this way:",32,mtms2010-02-310a,,

"This student was not able to “write down” a rule, starting with “y =.” We attributed this result to middle school students’ inexperience with the patterns of a step function and how to represent it. The context of shearing sheep was accessible for them, but the numerical pattern was unfamiliar (e.g., 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, . . .).  iMPlications FoR teaching",34,mtms2010-02-310a,,
"We believe the choice to expose both middle-grades students and university students to a more difficult pattern than they were familiar with was both  insightful and interesting, in part, for these reasons: 1.  Both groups of students were able to experience some success because the task was something they found appealing and engaging.  2.  Being able to act out the task and model with counters made it accessible for the students.  3.  Those who chose to represent the problem in multiple ways tended to have the most success, most likely because they were able to “see” the pattern within the various representations and cross-check their answers. ",35,mtms2010-02-310a,,
"In the future, we need to be better prepared to help students wrestle with the issue of the remainder and methods for communicating their results. We feel that it would be appropriate to discuss how to handle the remainder after students have wrestled with a few simplified problems on their own. This would give them some prior knowledge in thinking about what to do with the remainder before applying it to a more difficult problem.",36,mtms2010-02-310a,,
" We also recognize the importance  of structuring the middle school students’ task to include tables and graphs, which were not evident in the university students’ solutions. When those representations were not included, the university students found it difficult to generate a rule. This led us to include both a table and a blank graph in the revised handout for the middle-grades students. ",37,mtms2010-02-310a,,
"If the pattern in this task had been  continuous, it is likely that students would not have had as much trouble identifying or extending the pattern. They have seen linear and quadratic patterns before and these patterns are more intuitive to extend. However, the skipping pattern generated by a step function is unfamiliar. A regular 45-minute class period was not enough  time. We recommend allowing ample time for students to work through this task because it may take them longer to process a pattern of this nature.
