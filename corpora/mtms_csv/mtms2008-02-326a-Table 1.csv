"Assessing Understanding through Problem Writing aAs performance-based curricula and  teacher accountability gain greater emphasis, teachers need avenues to ensure that their students are learning the mathematics content being delivered. According to the NCTM’s Assessment Standards for School Mathematics (1995), assessment practices should enable teachers to assess students’ performance in a manner that reflects what students know and can do. Unfortunately, the typical classroom assessments, such as chapter tests, homework assignments, and the like, rarely accurately reflect the  angela Barlow, abarlow@ olemiss.edu, teaches mathematics education courses at the University of Mississippi, University, Ms 38677. she is interested in problem writing and its impact on teachers’ ideas about mathematics.

"NCTM advocates a focus on  students learning procedures with understanding. This expectation requires a shift in assessment strategies so as to measure students’ mathematical understandings. The purpose of this article is to describe the use of problem writing as a versatile, meaningful assessment tool for determining students’ level of mathematical understanding.",3,mtms2008-02-326a,,

ProBleM Writing,5,mtms2008-02-326a,,
Problem writing engages students in the act of creating mathematical word problems in response to prompts that are selected by the teacher. Prompts may vary according to the mathematical understandings being measured. They may also vary according to the mathematical topics being studied. See figure 1 for sample prompts.,6,mtms2008-02-326a,,
"Problem writing differs from typical assessments in that it is an open-ended assessment. The openness of this type of assessment allows the students to show understanding at a variety of levels. For example, a more advanced student may choose to write a complex problem, whereas a less able student may write a less sophisticated yet accurate problem. Students’ levels of understandings and abilities are not usually revealed through problems that merely require students to use an algorithm. One merit of this problem-writing strategy is that it is easy to implement. Because students are asked to create a single problem, it does not have the drawbacks of other open-ended assessments, such as essays and projects, which require much time and creativity in designing and scoring. Additionally, this type of assessment can easily be added to any assessment tool. To provide an example of assessing  through problem writing, we asked students to respond to the following: Write a word problem that can be represented by 6 ÷ 1/2. Before considering students’ work, attention needs to be given to the concepts important to understanding division of fractions.",7,mtms2008-02-326a,,
Models For division,8,mtms2008-02-326a,,
The following problems demonstrate two different models for division. Try using illustrations to represent and solve each one before reading further.,9,mtms2008-02-326a,,
1.  Mary has 20 apples with which to bake pies. She will need 5 apples for each pie. How many pies can she bake?,10,mtms2008-02-326a,,
Fig. 1 sample prompts •  The answer is 20 cookies. Create the word problem.,11,mtms2008-02-326a,,
•  Create a word problem for the number sentence 3n + 5 = 17.,12,mtms2008-02-326a,,
•  Write a word problem that involves the addition of fractions.,13,mtms2008-02-326a,,
•  examine the graph provided. Write at least 3 different word problems that  can be answered using the graph.,14,mtms2008-02-326a,,
2.  Mary has 20 apples. She wants to give each of her 5 friends the same number of apples. How many apples will each friend receive?,15,mtms2008-02-326a,,
"Both of these word problems can be represented by 20 ÷ 5. In this expression, 20 is referred to as the dividend and 5 as the divisor. Although the divisor and the dividend are the same numbers in each problem, the two problem structures represent different models of division. In problem 1, the divisor represents the number in each group. The question is how many groups will be formed. This model is called the repeated subtraction model or the measurement model of division (Bassarear 2005). In the case of 6 ÷ 1/2, a word problem using the repeated subtraction model would be asking the solver to find how many groups of 1/2 are in 6 wholes.",16,mtms2008-02-326a,,
"On the other hand, in problem 2 the divisor represents the number of groups. The question is how many apples will be in each group. This is an example of the partitioning model (Bassarear 2005). The apples, in this case, are being partitioned into a set number of groups. In representing  6 ÷ 1/2 with the partitioning model, a word problem would describe 6 as being partitioned into half a group. The question would then be how many would be in a single group.",17,mtms2008-02-326a,,
"In problems 1 and 2, the answer 4 is referred to as the quotient. Notice that the quotient has different units, depending on which model of division the problem represents. For example, problem 1 begins with 20 apples, which  are being divided, yet the quotient is 4 pies. Problem 2 once again begins with 20 apples, which are being divided. However, the quotient for this problem is 4 apples. Therefore, in representing 6 ÷ 1/2, the units of the question will differ, depending on which model the student chooses to represent.",18,mtms2008-02-326a,,
"When a student completely  understands division, the meaning of the divisor, the dividend, and the quotient is known. An indication of this understanding is an ability to use either the measurement model or the partition model to represent the dividend, the divisor, and the quotient. When representing these models with word problems, the student who understands division should be able to formulate a question whose solution is the quotient. The next section will describe a system for using studentgenerated word problems to assess students’ understandings of division.",19,mtms2008-02-326a,,

Incorrect,31,mtms2008-02-326a,,
"Problems demonstrating incorrect understanding fell into three subcategories. Students with problems in the first incorrect subcategory demonstrated that they understood division as separating into groups but did not understand how to represent division by one-half. Their problems instead represented 6 ÷ 2 (see fig. 2). This student is possibly confusing “divided by one-half ” with “divide in half,” which would mean to divide the players into two equal groups. ",32,mtms2008-02-326a,,
"The majority of the incorrect  responses fell into the second subcategory, in which the problems actually represented 6 × 1/2. These students demonstrated that they understood how to take one-half of a number but not how to divide by one-half (see fig. 3). In this sample problem, the student took half of the 6 bottles of water. The student seems to be confusing “divided by one-half ” with “half of a number.”",33,mtms2008-02-326a,,
The final subcategory for incorrect responses contained problems  ing the division of fractions would be insufficient for writing an accurate problem. ,34,mtms2008-02-326a,,
"To identify the levels of understanding exhibited in the students’ word problems, it was necessary to develop a scoring system. We chose to use the scoring categories that were part of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) (National Center for Education Statistics 2006). The NAEP scoring system is widely known and therefore provided a set of categories with which readers are already familiar and perhaps already using in their own classrooms. Additionally, this scoring system measures mathematical understandings through examining responses to open-ended test items, which was also the goal of this exercise, further making the use of this scoring system appropriate. The scoring system consists of six levels—omit, incorrect, minimal, partial, satisfactory, and extended. The descriptors for each of the six levels vary according to the item being scored.",35,mtms2008-02-326a,,
Our scoring was based on the ,36,mtms2008-02-326a,,

Satisfactory,40,mtms2008-02-326a,,
"To be classified in the satisfactory category, students’ problems had to correctly represent 6 ÷ 1/2 and include an appropriate question. However, these problems did not provide a realistic scenario. In figure 7, the student demonstrated his or her understanding of what it means to divide 6 by 1/2. It was correctly represented through the division of 6 pizzas into groups of size 1/2. By including the answer, the student also demonstrated that he or she could correctly solve the problem 6 ÷ 1/2. The situation described in the problem, though, is not necessarily realistic in that there are many factors that would impact whether or not people would eat half of a pizza. These factors include the size of the pizza, the sizes of the people, and the appetites of the people. Without these factors being described in the problem and without having the student explain his or her thinking, one is making an assumption ",41,mtms2008-02-326a,,
Fig. 4 Problem categorized as incorrect: incomplete attempt to represent 6 ÷ 1/2,42,mtms2008-02-326a,,
"Fig. 5 Problem categorized as minimal that were classified as “other.” The scenarios in these problems were incomplete and/or not mathematically related to the prompt. As one can see from figure 4, student responses in this subcategory indicated incomplete thought that is perhaps not related to the prompt of 6 ÷ 1/2. ",43,mtms2008-02-326a,,
Minimal,44,mtms2008-02-326a,,
"Only one student’s problem was classified as minimal (see fig. 5). Although this student did not write a mathematical word problem as prompted, a procedural knowledge of division is evident by the student including the quotient of 12, which distinguishes it from the problems in the incorrect category. The student also provided evidence of his or her knowledge of the vocabulary associated with division through the use of the word quotient. Note that the question does not exactly match the prompt, given that the answer to the problem is 1/2, whereas the answer to the prompt is 12. However, by including 12 in the problem, one can deduce that the student understands how to apply a procedure to find the answer to 6 ÷ 1/2. For this reason, this student’s work was given a higher ranking as compared with the previously examined problems in the incorrect category.",45,mtms2008-02-326a,,
Partial,46,mtms2008-02-326a,,
"Responses falling in the partial category correctly represented 6 ÷ 1/2 but either failed to include a question with the problem or included an incorrect question. Figure 6 shows a problem in which the student included an incorrect question. This student correctly represented 6 ÷ 1/2 because the student divided 6 wholes, or cakes, into groups that are of the size 1/2, or “1/2ves” as the student wrote. However, the answer to the question, ",47,mtms2008-02-326a,,

"Fig. 7 Problem categorized as satisfactory regarding the problem to say that it is realistic. Therefore, we classified the problem as satisfactory.",49,mtms2008-02-326a,,
Extended,50,mtms2008-02-326a,,
"When a problem met the conditions of satisfactory but also included a realistic scenario, the response was classified as extended. Compare the previous problem with the problem contained in figure 8. This student not only correctly represented the problem 6 ÷ 1/2 but also provided a realistic scenario. Unlike the pizza problem, it is clearly realistic to consider cutting apples in half to share.",51,mtms2008-02-326a,,
Insight Gained from Problems,52,mtms2008-02-326a,,
"In assessing students’ understanding of division by fractions, we looked at three key pieces of evidence. We wanted to see the ability to represent (1) division by a fraction using either the measurement or partition model; (2) the quotient by asking an appropriate question; and (3) a realistic scenario. Students’ misunderstandings were exposed through this assessment in a manner that closed assessments would not. Based on students’ word problems and representations, students appeared to be interpreting the prompt “6 divided by 1/2” to mean “6 divided in half ” or “take half of the number 6.” However, without asking students to explain their thinking, this is merely our interpretation of their misunderstandings. Regardless, word problems representing these interpretations of 6 ÷ 1/2 were given by 49 percent of the students. Only 15 percent of the students provided problems that correctly represented  6 ÷ 1/2, indicating an accurate understanding of division by a fraction. However, four students seemed to have an unclear interpretation of the quotient as indicated by questions that did not match the division problem. Only a small minority of the students in these two classes have met the ",53,mtms2008-02-326a,,

discussion and conclusion,55,mtms2008-02-326a,,
"As stated in the opening and as seen through the examples, problem writing provides an easy-to-implement assessment that readily reveals students’ understandings and misunderstandings. In retrospect, this assessment could have provided an even clearer picture had students been asked to explain their thinking. In our future assessments, this will  be a requirement. ",56,mtms2008-02-326a,,
"Knowledge gained from this assessment can be used by the teacher in several ways. First, it could be used to target students’ remediation needs. Second, this information could  be used to differentiate instruction through classroom activities tailored to meet the needs of the students in each of the scoring categories. Third, the results of the problem-writing activity could be used as a grouping strategy. Students could be divided into either homogenous or heterogeneous groups according their scoring categories. Fourth, problem writing could be used as a diagnostic tool for upcoming chapters, thus guiding instructional decisions and contributing to quality instruction. ",57,mtms2008-02-326a,,
"In creating a rubric for problemwriting assessments, which evaluates not just answers but the degree to which students understand concepts, we realized the importance of knowing the concepts underlying the mathematics being assessed. Some resources that we have found helpful are Bassarear (2005), Chapin and ",58,mtms2008-02-326a,,
"Johnson (2006), and van de Walle (2006). We have also realized that the general category descriptors for the rubric remain the same regardless of the problem. However, these can be better defined depending on the concept being assessed.",59,mtms2008-02-326a,,
"In this day of standards-based  instruction, students are expected to develop a deep understanding of the mathematics being studied. Having versatile, meaningful assessment tools that assess students’ levels of understanding is essential for today’s teachers. Problem writing is just such a tool, with the additional benefit of being easily implemented. Despite its simplistic nature, this assessment tool provides teachers with valuable  insight into the understandings and misunderstandings of their students. Through problem writing, students have the opportunity to demonstrate procedural and conceptual understandings of the mathematics being assessed as well as their ability to communicate and represent these ideas. Insights not readily available through typical assessments are revealed. The possibilities for using the information gained through problem writing in the classroom are endless.",60,mtms2008-02-326a,,
