0,Penguin Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Many students are not motivated to learn mathematics when textbook examples contain largely nonexistent contexts or when the math is not used to solve significant problems found in real life. This articleâ€™s project explores how male Emperor penguins are able to survive in Antarctica. In so doing, it addresses measurement, applies geometry, and helps foster problem-solving skills, all within a real-life context.",,
1,Penguin Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,GETTING TO KNOW THE EMPEROR,,
2,Penguin Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Emperor penguins, the largest of all the penguin species, attain heights of nearly four feet and weigh up to 99 pounds. Their pale yellow breast and bright yellow ear patches distinguish them visually. As part of their breeding cycle, male Emperor penguins survive in Antarctica for four months with no food and incubate the eggs that their mates have entrusted to them.",,
3,Penguin Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Emperor penguins breed during the Antarctic winter. Temperatures will typically drop to â€“40Â°F, and winds can reach 90 mph. Emperors have only one mate, which they must find in a large breeding colony. Females lay one egg in May or June and then, with their nutritional reserves depleted, head back to the ocean to feed for two months while the males incubate the egg and care for the newly hatched chicks.",,
4,Penguin Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"When the females return, the males will have gone without food for about four months and can lose up to 44 pounds of body weight. Once the females return, the males feed for a few weeks, and then parenting duties are shared.",,
5,Penguin Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"For the Emperor penguin to survive in such an extreme environment, it has developed several adaptations to the cold. Its densely packed feathers provide about 85 percent of its insulation; it also has a thick layer of up to 3 cm deep subdermal fat. The head, bill, and flippers are proportionally smaller than those of other penguins, helping maintain body heat because these areas are not as well insulated. To conserve energy, these penguins huddle in groups that can range from 10 to 5,000. Huddling not only decreases the exposed body surface area but also significantly reduces heat loss. This last aspect of huddling forms the basis for this project.",,
6,Penguin Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,PREREQUISITES,,
7,Penguin Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We want students to estimate the body surface area (BSA) of an individual penguin and compare it with a BSA estimate of a huddled penguin to determine the heat-saving benefit of huddling. Students must be familiar with computing the surface area of basic three-dimensional solids, such as spheres, cylinders, and cones. To complete the computations, they need to have some experience with measurement conversions. It is also helpful for students to know that energy can be measured in calories; thus, a gram of body fat provides a fixed number of calories.",,
8,Penguin Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,DEVELOPING ESTIMATION SKILLS,,
9,Penguin Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The goal of the project is for students to estimate how much energy penguins can conserve by huddling in groups. Because a huddle of penguins can be enormous and almost impossible to count, we begin by showing the class some images of a packed football stadium, a petri dish with bacterial culture, and various wildlife photographs. We then ask students how they could possibly count the individual people, bacteria, and animals. We discuss strategies, such as counting rows and columns and then multiplying, counting a section and multiplying by the number of sections, and dividing into grids and counting a random selection of squares (which is exactly how biologists count some microorganisms).",,
10,Penguin Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We then tell them that they are researchers in Antarctica and need to count an Emperor penguin huddle because these penguins are becoming an endangered species. We have students use a classroom set of binoculars that will allow two students per group to view the huddle at a time; students can also hold their hands up in the shape of binoculars for the same effect. We tell them that our estimates must be done quickly because it is the middle of the Antarctic winter and the temperature is â€“40Â°F, so we cannot spend a lot of time outside the shelter of our vehicle. We then project an image of a large penguin huddle onto the white board for 30 seconds and ask students to count or estimate the number of penguins. (See the image at this site: http://www.arkive.org/emperor-penguin/aptenodytes-forsteri/image-G57959.html.) No one is allowed to say a word until the binoculars have been handed off to other group members. We then ask for their answers and how they estimated the number.",,
11,Penguin Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"There were 338 penguins in this modest huddle, but we received responses from 100 to more than 1,000. Although some students simply guessed, others said that they â€œcounted the outer ring and multiplied the number of ringsâ€ or â€œfound groups of 100, considered there to be three groups of 100â€ or â€œcounted the first row and multiplied by the number of rows.â€",,
12,Penguin Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,PROPORTIONAL REASONING,,
13,Penguin Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The next step for our Antarctic researchers was to estimate the body surface area, or BSA, of a penguin by using measurements on printed or digital images. One advantage of this approach was that it introduced students to a real-life application of proportional reasoning. They computed the scale of the image and then found the ratio, or scale factor, to convert their measured quantities to full-size measurements, at which time they could use them to find the required estimates.",,
14,Penguin Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We asked that students try to model the body of the penguin with one three-dimensional solid that they thought would best approximate the BSA. Some students struggled to make the connection between the two-dimensional images representing three-dimensional objects. For example, some groups initially used a rectangle or a rectangular box to approximate the penguin body instead of a cylinder as we had hoped, not perceiving that the penguin body was three dimensional or round. Some students also had trouble comprehending the idea of the scale of the image compared with a life-size penguin.",,
15,Penguin Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"To help the students make these connections, we brought in eight-inch plush stuffed Emperor penguins and gave one to each group. Although the stuffed penguins were not perfectly proportioned anatomically, they were close enough to help students see the cylindrical shape of the body. The model penguins were also valuable in helping students understand scale factors and proportion.",,
16,Penguin Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"An adult Emperor penguin is about four feet tall, so we asked the students how many of the plush penguins would have to stack on top of one another to be as tall as an adult Emperor. Some students were able to do the dimensional conversion mentally and get the answer right away, but to make sure everyone understood, we asked students to participate in a hands-on demonstration. We held up a measuring tape extended to four feet and asked the groups to stack their penguins on top of one another to physically see that six stuffed penguins fit into the height of the life-size adult. This stacking illustrated a 1/6 scale, or 1:6. This activity also had the added benefit of demonstrating to the students that the radius of their image had to be multiplied by the same factor as the height to accurately describe the life-size penguin because the stack of six penguins was far too skinny to be proportional. (See fig. 1 for one student explanation of scale.)",,
17,Penguin Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
18,Penguin Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,MEASUREMENT UNCERTAINTY,,
19,Penguin Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We stopped the class after the image measurements were taken, and again after they computed the penguinâ€™s BSA, and asked them to share their results. They were surprised to see that there were many different answers for the measurements and the final BSA of the Emperor penguin. For example, in one class with six groups, the height measurement of the image ranged from 6.0â€“6.2 cm and the radius from 1â€“1.5 cm. The larger difference in the radius measurement variation resulted from the fact that two of the groups thought the approximating cylinder should not exclude any part of the beak. (See fig. 2.)",,
20,Penguin Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
21,Penguin Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We asked students why the answers varied and whether or not there was just one correct answer. In mathematics, some students find variation and uncertainty foreign and puzzling. We questioned them further: â€œAre the images different? Are the rulers different?â€ They soon realized that different people can look at the same object and see something slightly different. We explained that any measured quantity will inherently have measurement error. In this case, there was not one correct answer, in part because the height and radius of the photograph could not be measured exactly with a ruler because a ruler does not have infinite accuracy or precision.",,
22,Penguin Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"A more appropriate question is this: What is the best estimate from our experimental data? One answer would be to just state a range of values for the measurement, as we did above. A better answer would be to state that the best estimate of the answer is the average of the different measurements, and we discussed this tactic as one way to deal with the variation. For this class, the average height was h â‰ˆ 6.03 cm and the average radius was r â‰ˆ 1.29 cm. However, we should also ask what an appropriate allowed uncertainty would be for the means. Ideally, we want to express an answer as",,
23,Penguin Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,measurement = best estimate Â± uncertainty.,,
24,Penguin Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We did not pursue this further with our sixth-grade classes because these students did not have the necessary statistical background. However, students in later grades could consider the standard deviation of the measurements.",,
25,Penguin Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"After scaling up to life-size measurements, the resulting total BSA for the groups varied from 17,584 cm2 to 28,260 cm2, which was a significant range. (See table 1.) If we use the average class measurements, the scaled-up height and radius are approximately 120.07 cm and 25.83 cm, respectively, and the area estimate is",,
26,Penguin Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
27,Penguin Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"This is a better estimate for the life-size BSA. Incorporating measurement uncertainty into the calculation of the BSA is a little more work. We did not go into the details with sixth graders but have included a discussion with the online solutions. However, we did emphasize that measurements involve error and that we must be aware of that error, and at least consider averaging, and not rounding, intermediate values as ways to improve our experimental results.",,
28,Penguin Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We saw the same proportional reasoning and measurement variation when we had the students compute the huddled BSA per penguin. We first brought our group of stuffed penguins together and formed a miniature huddle so that students could again visualize what shape the huddle would take. After realizing that the huddle, too, was fairly well approximated by a cylinder, we asked students to compute the scale factor from the photograph, measuring the radius and diameter of the huddle. After computing the surface area of the cylindrical huddle, they divided by their estimated number of penguins. On average, this class estimated a 66.5 percent decrease in the penguinâ€™s BSA (and fat burned) compared with the 49 percent and 56 percent decrease, respectively, that researchers found (Gilbert et al. 2008). This was not discouraging to us, considering how simplistic our model was. We summarize the results for the class in table 1.",,
29,Penguin Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
30,Penguin Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,QUESTIONING OUR ASSUMPTIONS,,
31,Penguin Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"To complete this project, students had to make some simplifying assumptions, as is the case in any mathematical model. Too many times, others make these assumptions for the student, and the students never question or evaluate the assumptions. Many times, the assumptions are not even acknowledged.",,
32,Penguin Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Along the way, we emphasized what assumptions we were making and asked students what effect they thought the assumptions would have on the outcome. For example, we approximated the surface area of a single penguin by the surface area of a cylinder. We asked students why they thought this was the best choice and whether the cylinder would overestimate or underestimate the true surface area. (See fig. 3.)",,
33,Penguin Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
34,Penguin Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Students argued both ways, with most deciding that it would overestimate because there was â€œempty space leftâ€; others thought it would underestimate because parts of the penguinâ€™s body were outside the cylinder. When we asked them what solid would approximate the penguin huddle, they again concluded that a cylinder would be most appropriate. We then asked if we should include the bottom of the cylinder as exposed surface area and if the area of the solid would overestimate or underestimate. One class wanted to include the bottom because heat could escape through the ice; another group disagreed because the cold air and wind could not get beneath the penguins on the inside of the huddle. Most groups thought the solid would underestimate the true surface area of the huddle because the cracks between the bodies, the space between the feet, and the bumpy surface created by backs and heads were not included. We likened it to the fact that it takes more paint to cover a bumpy surface than a smooth one.",,
35,Penguin Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We then discussed the estimate of the fat burned by a huddled penguin. We asked what assumptions they were making, how they would affect their answer, and whether all the penguins would have the same amount of their surface area exposed. Students said that the penguins on the outside would be more exposed and were unsure how this would affect their answer. We then revealed that the penguins perform a kind of dance in which they constantly rotate their position in the huddle so that they share the burden of the cold over time. Also, we are assuming that the penguins are in the huddle continuously, for twenty-four hours a day, which is unlikely, so we were overestimating the amount of heat saved by huddling. This type of analysis is difficult for many students and sometimes requires careful questioning and class discussion, but it is absolutely beneficial to their critical-thinking skills.",,
36,Penguin Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,REAL-LIFE MATHEMATICS,,
37,Penguin Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"This project explained one of the ways that Emperor penguins have adapted to survive the extreme conditions of Antarctic winters. Students used a fairly small set of background skills to combine and apply geometry, measurement, conversions, and (possibly) statistics to the problem of computing penguin body surface area and heat conservation. Students became aware of the concept of measurement uncertainty and how it could affect the outcome of the problems they were solving. Finally, students learned about model assumptions and questioned their validity and effect on the outcome of their computations. They combined many areas of mathematics with science to solve a real-life problem; it was a meaningful and fun learning experience for both teacher and student.",,
