One student in the class said, “I would volunteer for my younger sister because although we fi ght often, she is still my sister and I love her.

Part 1: Entries in the Reaping The lesson was completed over two fifty-minute class periods. Most students in the classes had already read The Hunger Games and were able to explain the story line to the few students who had not yet read it. We took a few minutes and encouraged students to share their personal insights about the story with the rest of the class. Students were eager to describe the main characters; discuss the inhumanity of the story; and point ,10,mtms2012-03-426a,,
The Standards at Work,11,mtms2012-03-426a,,
"The Common Core State Standards  for Mathematics (CCSSI 2010) and NCTM’s Content Standards were both used as guiding frameworks. This activity addressed 4. Model  with Mathematics, a Common Core Math Practice, which states that mathematically proficient students should “routinely interpret their mathematical results in the context of the situation” (p. 7).",12,mtms2012-03-426a,,
"This Hunger Games activity  also addressed 1. Make Sense of Problems and Persevere in Solving Them because students must “start by explaining to themselves the meaning of a problem and looking for entry points to its solution” (CCSSM 2010, p. 6). This activity also aligns well with the Common Core Standards for seventh-grade mathematics, which state, in part, that students should “develop a probability model and use it to find probabilities of events” (CCSSI 2010, p. 51). Moreover, this activity can be related to the Curriculum Focal Points (NCTM 2006) for grades 6-8 in that students compute probabilities from simulations incorporating organized lists and tree diagrams.  out unfair elements of the reaping system, or student lottery drawing for the televised games. Some students specifically explained how they connected the story to their own life. Students commented on what their life would be like in the Panem district:  •	 “When	I	imagine	having	to	live	in	 a Panem district, doing my homework doesn’t seem so bad.” •	 “I	couldn’t	imagine	having	to	kill	 animals with bows and arrows just so my family could eat.” •	 “It	would	be	awful	to	live	in	 ",13,mtms2012-03-426a,,
District 12.”,14,mtms2012-03-426a,,
Different discussions evolved from each class period on the basis of students’ interests. This process engaged the entire class and built a high level of connection to the mathematical activity.,15,mtms2012-03-426a,,
"After discussing the plot, students  were asked to imagine their class as one of the 12 Panem districts. To prepare for the lottery to select two young people from each district for the Hunger Games television show, students first had to find how many entries containing their name would be placed in the annual reaping lottery. Students’ names were placed in a drawing on the basis of their age and neediness condition (resulting in the need for tesserae, or additional food resources). To find this neediness amount, each student used a calculator with a random integer function. Without telling students ahead of time what their random calculatorgenerated results meant, each student programmed their calculator to randomly select either a 0 or 1 using the calculator’s random number feature.",16,mtms2012-03-426a,,
"Students were motivated by the  use of technology, but the same results can be obtained by flipping a coin or rolling a standard number cube. After all students generated either a 0 or 1, the teacher explained: ",17,mtms2012-03-426a,,
Students’ paper entries were placed in containers.,18,mtms2012-03-426a,,
"If your calculator generated a 0, your family is not starving and you do not have to submit extra entries in exchange for food resources (or tesserae) each year. If your calculator generated a 1, your family is starving, and you have always had to submit the maximum number of extra entries each year since you were 12 to feed your family (all members in your household, including yourself ).",19,mtms2012-03-426a,,
Students instantly realized what their number 1 or 0 meant. The class burst into cheers and groans at the same time; the students knew that their fate had been determined for their very own hunger games. ,20,mtms2012-03-426a,,
"Next, the class reviewed the  process and calculated the number of times their names would be placed in the drawing for the annual reaping. See figure 1 for guidelines on how students calculated their number of entries, which matches the story. Student work examples are illustrated in figure 2. ",21,mtms2012-03-426a,,
"As student work was checked to see whether they were correctly calculating their own number of entries, a common misconception emerged. Several students wanted to add the total number of entries for their age and add the number of multiplicative entries for tesserae in the same way. For example, a 14-year-old student incorrectly stated that six entries would result for his or her age because one student kept track as the class added the total number of girldrawing entries.",22,mtms2012-03-426a,,
       1 (age 12) + 2 (age 13)                    + 3 (age 14) = 6.,23,mtms2012-03-426a,,
"However, age is not calculated multiplicatively, and this student should have only 3 entries for age—1 for each year. This issue was resolved when student volunteers created the chart found in figure 1, which highlighted how students should calculate the entries based on age. ",24,mtms2012-03-426a,,
"After all students had calculated  their final number of entries based on age and received tesserae, they repeatedly wrote their names on pieces of paper and placed the determined number of entries with their name into either the boy reaping or the girl reaping lotteries. ",25,mtms2012-03-426a,,
Part 2: What Are the Chances?,26,mtms2012-03-426a,,
"After all entries were placed into the lotteries by gender, students were asked to identify what information they needed to calculate their probability of being selected for the hunger games. Students quickly decided that the class needed to know the total number of entries in each collection, which we tabulated together as a class.",27,mtms2012-03-426a,,
"After the total number of entries for  boys and girls were found, the teacher posed a series of questions in an activity sheet to engage students in thinking about the fairness (or unfairness), probabilities, and possible outcomes ",28,mtms2012-03-426a,,

"For example, if you are 14 years old, your baseline number of entries  would be 3 (1 for each year—12, 13, and 14). Added to this number  would be your tesserae. For example, if you have 5 members in your  family, the entries for tesserae at age 14 would be 5 × 3 = 15. ",36,mtms2012-03-426a,,

"Students immediately took an  interest in the activity sheet and were placed in groups of three. Any student who had not read The Hunger Games was grouped with at least one other student who had. They were eager to compare their own chances of being drawn in the reaping with those of their classmates. Rachel stated, “Not only is the number of entries you have not fair, it’s also not fair that 18-yearolds have to go against 12-year-olds.” We overheard a conversation between ",44,mtms2012-03-426a,,

"The boy’s chances of getting  drawn were much higher than the girl’s chances because of the difference in the total number of boy and girl entries in that class. Students also discussed the probability differences between different class periods on the basis of class sizes, boy-girl ratios, and the number of entries from each student. Students told us: •	 “My	probability	of	being	chosen	 in another class period [district] would be different from my class period. This is because the population of the class periods is different, so the chance for me changes.”  •	 “The	chance	for	being	selected	 would be different in another class period because of different variables such as boy-girl ratio, number of students, students drawn for tesserae, and with different numbers of family members to support.”",47,mtms2012-03-426a,,

"After groups completed the activity sheet, the class reunited and discussed which questions were challenging and which results were interesting or surprising. Item 5, “Write an algebraic equation representing a person’s total number of entries for a given year,” was difficult for students. Generally, they were able to calculate their total number of entries arithmetically but struggled to represent the operations symbolically (adding for age and multiplying for tesserae) in the form of an equation.",49,mtms2012-03-426a,,
"Some students struggled to form   an equation until we helped them define the possible variables. To help them think about the variables that determined their total number of entries, we asked, “What factors cause you to have entries?” “What operation occurs with that variable?” “What if your calculator generated a 0. Would your equation still work?” See figure 3 for various student-created equations. ",50,mtms2012-03-426a,,
"Students found a question involving permutations (item 9) and another on grouping (item 12) especially challenging. Most students thought that the solution to item 9 was extremely large, so we took this opportunity to discuss how switching the order of just 2 people (out of the 24) counts as another possibility. Some students incorrectly wanted to find the number of combinations, rather than permutations, of this event.",51,mtms2012-03-426a,,
"To help students realize the difference between a combination and a permutation, we wrote several examples on the board of nearly, but not exactly, identical orders for the 24 contestants. Making comparisons seemed to help students conceptualize how there could be so many more different possibilities in a permutation. For item 12, once students visualized and illustrated what the question was asking, many students ",52,mtms2012-03-426a,,

"Rounding percentages was another  common student misunderstanding. When calculating probability on their calculators, students wanted to round the decimal solution instead of changing the decimal to a percentage first and then rounding.

Next, he or she would note that the directions asked students to round to the nearest hundredth percent. However, instead  of changing the decimal to a percentage first (4.03225806 . . . percent)  and then rounding their solution (4.03 percent), students incorrectly rounded their decimal to the nearest ",55,mtms2012-03-426a,,

"But more important, this lesson gave students the opportunity to investigate the notion of chance events and develop, use, and evaluate probability models as emphasized in both the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics and the Curriculum Focal Points. Students’ perspectives on the fairness of the hunger games were both interesting and surprising. We were most surprised by how students viewed fairness in two different ways—as the fairness of one entry in the reaping as a random selection or as the fairness for the contestants competing in the games. We read and heard a variety of student responses: •	 “This	game	would	not	be	fair	 because everyone had different  skills and different strategies  for competing.” •	 “Considering	that	it’s	a	random	 selection, yes, it is fair as far as choice, but it is unfair because  not all contestants are equally matched.” •	 “Yes,	because	it	is	random,	but	it’s	 also sort of not fair because some people have 18 entries while  others have 2.” geneRal ReMaRKS",66,mtms2012-03-426a,,
"Students used reasoning and sense making during this activity to address mathematical situations from an engaging context in meaningful ways. Throughout the activity, students expressed their disbelief at some of the small calculated probabilities and some of the large total possible outcomes, as found on their activity sheet. These discoveries provided a nice transition to extended conversations about very small and very large numbers and the probability of winning a game of chance, such as the lottery.",67,mtms2012-03-426a,,
"In some classes, we talked about some games being based solely on chance, such as the lottery; some based on multiple variables, such as the skill needed in horse racing; or on both, such as found in card games. It was not surprising that the issue  of fairness dominated students’  initial discussions about the story.  As their understanding of the underlying probability concepts became more sophisticated, their ability to separate various nuances in fairness increased.",68,mtms2012-03-426a,,
Students quickly applied their  new understanding to consequences of finding a different total number of entries for each class period. This understanding and application grew naturally as students grappled with these concepts in the context of the story and discussed the implications of the antagonists with respect to their personal situation.,69,mtms2012-03-426a,,
"Their ability to blend their personal and story contexts and share the meaning of each in terms of fairness as defined by probability contributed to a very powerful learning experience.
