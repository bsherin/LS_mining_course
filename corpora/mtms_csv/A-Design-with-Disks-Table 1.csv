4,A Design with Disks,"Arianna is making a circular design out of disks. She places a large disk in the center. Around that large disk, she will place a full ring of disks in red. Around the red circle, she will place a full ring of disks in blue. She will continue in this manner, picking a new color for each ring she adds. Here is what Arianna knows: • Ten of the red disks, when placed in a line, are about 11 cm long. •  If a circle were drawn around the red disks, its diameter would be 4.25 cm.  1.   If Arianna wants the design to have a diameter of about 13 cm, how  many rings of disks will she need?  2.  How many disks will Arianna need for the 2nd ring? The 3rd ring? 3.   In general, how many disks will Arianna need to add to each consecutive  ring? How do you know?  4.   Write an equation that will allow Arianna to ﬁ nd the number of disks  needed for any ring in her design.",4,A Design with Disks

Wells, wellsp@ gvsu.edu, Grand Valley State University, Allendale, Michigan.  wWriting rich mathematical problems  is a complex and interesting task. Quality mathematical tasks have many characteristics but should, among other things, be accessible to all students, allow for a variety of solution methods, fi t the audience for which the task is designed, and allow for reasoning and communication. In the April 2017 issue of Mathematics Teaching in the Middle School, we offered a patterning task dealing with making designs out of disks. The task asked students to continue a pattern of circular disks, creating additional rows of circles given a starting image (see fi g. 1). It required students to reason proportionally within a linear model, calculate circumferences, and make sense of remainders. This task is mathematically interesting and involves many of the characteristics of a rich mathematical task, but we did not receive any student work, possibly because of the timing of this problem near the end of the school year. We nevertheless believe the task to have mathematical merit. We would like to share how it was created, what changes we would make to it, and how ideas from it have been used in our classes, so you may use them with your students. ",6,A Design with Disks
7,A Design with Disks,"Although the problem presented in Solve It involved generic circular disks, the idea began as an exploration of crocheted disks in one of our classrooms. Crochet is a type of fi ber art that uses a hook and yarn to build an item; in crochet, you complete each stitch as you go, unlike with knitting, which maintains any number of unfi nished stitches on long needles. Like many arts, crochet is infused with mathematical concepts, perhaps most famously through the work of Daina Taimina (Taimina 2009), who fi rst used crochet to create a hyperbolic plane, which is a fi gure we will see later.

13,A Design with Disks,"Note that (b), the “just right” category, is not exactly perfect. One goal of our task was to have students make sense of remainders. In this case, adding a ﬁ nal blue disk is impossible, and parts of disks are also excluded; see (a). The same is true for stitches, which can only be completed in whole numbers; see (c).",13,A Design with Disks

We made signifi cant changes to the problem, and we would like to share how we chose to make those, what we learned from it, and what changes we would make for future use of the problem. ",18,A Design with Disks
19,A Design with Disks,CHANGING THE ORIGINAL PROBLEM,19,A Design with Disks
20,A Design with Disks,"First, we determined that the context needed to change because we could not assume that our readers have experience crocheting. We attempted to remedy this by changing to disks, which maintain the property of being discrete (the disks, like crochet stitches, must occur in whole numbers). Although this context offers a  cleaner introduction to the problem, on refl ection, we are unsure whether it gives enough detail. Since we did not receive any student work from the MTMS audience, we tried this problem with several of our own students, and a concern quickly arose as to whether the blue disks would nestle into open spaces (see fi g. 4). This concern does not occur when the context was crocheting, so perhaps some additional information or adjustment of framing for the problem is necessary for future use. Furthermore, the ambiguity of this “nestling” made it diffi cult for ",20,A Design with Disks
21,A Design with Disks,"Each color of points represents a growth pattern shown in the yarn and disks. Which color connects to which representation in ﬁ gure 2? additional stitches to make the second row, then the third, and so on. Unfortunately, many people new to crocheting do not carefully consider the math necessary for this task and end with a disk that is not fl at at all. To keep the disk fl at, one must increase the number of stitches in each row so that the new row is equal in length to the circumference of the circle it aims to create. The mathematically pertinent concept here is that as the diameter increases, so does the circumference, and, therefore, the number of stitches (and disks) in each row must grow at a constant rate to keep up. ",21,A Design with Disks
22,A Design with Disks,"The beauty of using crochet to explore this is the excellent visual representation of slope. In fi gure 2 you can see three possible results from attempting to crochet a disk. In the center is an appropriate crocheted disk that is fl at. On the left, too few stitches were added, and the disk has warped into a bowl shape. On the right, too many were added, and Daina Taimina’s hyperbolic plane appears.",22,A Design with Disks
23,A Design with Disks,"Here we see how crochet connects  to the Solve It problem: If you add  too few blue disks, the outer circle will be incomplete, which, when you are crocheting, means that the stitches will pull tight into a bowl. If you add too many blue disks, there will not be space for them, which means that the fabric will ripple. In either media, each new row has a fi xed diameter, and the circumference of your row must be appropriate for the given diameter. In each instance, students can see the ramifi cations of what happens when the increase is nonlinear (see fi g. 2). Even more mathematical richness occurs when these tangible representations are connected to a table or graph. Each shape is represented in fi gure 3, which shows a line of constant slope. Can you fi gure out which yarn and disk fi gure connects to each color of graphed points? ",23,A Design with Disks
24,A Design with Disks,"Having seen how powerful it was  for our students to connect these tangible representations of slope to the mathematically abstract tables and graphs we so often use in class, we sought to adapt this exploration for Solve It so that other teachers and students might benefi t. As is always  students to generalize the pattern beyond the third row. ",24,A Design with Disks
25,A Design with Disks,"A second concern we had when adapting this problem was creating an appropriate image. This is a highly visual problem, and the image needs to convey necessary aspects of the problem while not giving away things we want students to discover. For example, the black disk is intentionally larger than the red disks because we wanted to introduce a y-intercept, making the problem linear, not proportional. The red disks are all equal in size and fit nearly perfectly around the black disk. Although we like the simplicity of the image originally used (which included only the black and red disks), in hindsight, we would  alter this introductory image to the image in figure 1 for any future use of this problem to address the “nestling” concern and help students see where and how the blue disks will interact with the red. Some of the mathematical richness of this problem is that although the first row fits perfectly, the second row of blue disks will not do the same. We opted not to include any blue disks so as not to give anything away, but in hindsight, as you saw in figure 3, we found that our first image did not give enough information.  Figure 1 addresses those concerns while not giving away too much. ",25,A Design with Disks

We hope that you will take some of the mathematical ideas present in this article into your classrooms. We are grateful for having had the chance to reflect on the problem creation as a way to improve our problem writing for the future, and we hope it will help readers think about important ways that problems can be modified given the goals, knowledge, and experience of particular teachers.
