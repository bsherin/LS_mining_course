"Geometric concepts can be challenging to learn, because spatial reasoning is not easily acquired. Many students have difficulty describing the relationships that exist in a two-dimensional object by looking at a textbook representation. Learning and applying precise geometric terms and vocabulary can also be difficult. Definitions should evolve from experiences that include hands-on activities, mathematical reasoning, critical thinking, and high-level analyses. To be more specific, students should be able to experience constructing, drawing, measuring, contrasting, conjecturing, and classifying objects according to their properties. Activities that contain these elements will help strengthen students’ understanding of geometry.",3,mtms2009-11-222a,,

The two finished equilateral triangles need to be congruent. To verify the  congruency of the two triangles, place one on top of the other to see if they coincide; rotate the top one to verify that the triangles are equilateral. Use a contrasting colored sheet of construction paper and draw one straight line down the middle of the page that is parallel to the shorter 8 1/2 inch side.  2.  Position the construction paper so that the drawn line is horizontal. Make a star (a twelve-sided polygon, or dodecagon) by flipping one equilateral triangle across the horizontal axis; place it on top of the other triangle. Tie them together with yarn, as indicated (see fig. 1c).  3.

This activity introduces the Lithuanian holiday tradition of decorating with straw ornaments in geometric shapes. Directions are provided for making a Sunburst star within the context of a lesson that connects geometry with disciplines such as visual arts and social studies. Students can construct these decorations using everyday plastic coffee-stirrer straws and yarn or string (Metcalfe 1969). ,19,mtms2009-11-222a,,
"To strengthen the connection  between concepts and activities, the directions have been written (see  p. 224) to emphasize embedded geometric language. In Cipoletti and Wilson’s (2004) work with origami and other paper-folding activities, they found that the language in the directions was not written to support mathematical communications or understanding. They propose replacing everyday language with precise mathematical language and highlighting  it by using a bold font or italics. In addition, they found that when the directions are rewritten using mathematical language, the connection between definition and application is strengthened by affording students and teachers opportunities for mathematics language acquisition and expression.",20,mtms2009-11-222a,,
"Before working with students to  construct the Sunburst star, key mathematical vocabulary should be addressed. Students could be instructed to write the words in their math journals and illustrate the definitions. After the star is completed, students can refine their definitions once they have discussed the construction with classmates Students should work in pairs to avoid frustration. The star is easier to construct if one student holds the straws together while the other student ties the knot.",21,mtms2009-11-222a,,

"Eastern and northern Europeans have long decorated their homes, and later Christmas trees, with geometric shapes made from wheat, straw, or reeds. Wheat decorations were considered by ancient people to be a mystic promise to the end of winter; placing wheat in the home was believed to ensure the coming of spring. Over time, these geometric decorations transitioned into becoming a part of the traditions associated with the Christmas season. ",23,mtms2009-11-222a,,

Review the definitions of horizontal, vertical, and perpendicular. Students can take notes in their math journals or math notebook accompanied by pictures or diagrams to accompany key vocabulary words.

"Have students place the construction paper on the table with the Lithuanian sunburst star on top. Students can place the star anywhere on the paper; different positions will allow for good discussions with their partners or within their groups, providing more evidence for conjectures.

Making a quick sketch of each result will help those with figure or ground problems to keep track of what is happening. Prompt them by asking what conclusions can be drawn and why. Ask students to explore the result with horizontal slides and compare them with the consequences of vertical slides. Repeat with combination transformations that include both vertical and horizontal slides, such as moving it two inches up and one inch to the left. In doing so, always give the vertical slide first to mimic changes in direction modeled by slope.
