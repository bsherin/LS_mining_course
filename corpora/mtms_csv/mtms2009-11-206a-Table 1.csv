"Many consider proof to be central to the discipline of mathematics and to the work of mathematicians. However, the role of proof in school mathematics has traditionally been limited to high school geometry. ",0,mtms2009-11-206a,,
"This absence of proof in school  mathematics has not gone unnoticed and, in fact, has been a target of criticism. Sowder and Harel, for example, argue against limiting students’ experiences with proof to geometry: “It seems clear that to delay exposure to reason-giving until the secondaryschool geometry course and to expect at that point an instant appreciation for the more sophisticated mathematical justifications is an unreasonable expectation” (1998, p. 674).",1,mtms2009-11-206a,,
"Reflecting an awareness of such  criticism, as well as embracing the important role that proof plays in learning mathematics, recent reform efforts have called for substantial changes in students’ experiences with proof. In particular, Principles and Standards for School Mathematics recommends that “Reasoning and proof should be a consistent part of students’ mathematical experience in prekindergarten through grade 12” (NCTM 2000, p. 56).",2,mtms2009-11-206a,,

"As part of a written assessment  about justification and proof, we posed that question to approximately four hundred students from diverse ethnic backgrounds at an urban Midwestern middle school. Although we received a variety of responses, the following examples are both representative and informative:  •	 “You	experiment	until	you	find	five	 examples to see if the answer is right.” (Grade 6 student) •	 “When	you	get	your	test	back.”	 (Grade 6 student) •	 “You	don’t	really	know	if	anything	is	 right, you just have to hope and pray that you are right.” (Grade 7 student) •	 “If	it	is	called	a	theory	or	theorem,	 you know it’s true.” (Grade 8 student) •	 “If	you	are	smart,	you	will	know.”	 (Grade 8 student)",10,mtms2009-11-206a,,
"Although these responses are somewhat humorous and not surprising, they are also somewhat telling: On the basis of the majority of students’ responses (and reflected in the responses above), it seems relatively clear that many students have not given much thought to how one comes to know in mathematics. In fact, five of the six sample responses are not based on a mathematical rationale but on factors that are not under a student’s control (e.g., “you  know” only when a teacher corrects your test). Such responses are often because of a lack of ongoing and consistent experiences with reasoning and proof—experiences that help foster an awareness of reasoning as an important way to validate mathematical activity. In general, students’ responses to the question suggest that, to this point in their education, proof has not played a meaningful role in their mathematical experiences.",11,mtms2009-11-206a,,

"When	asked	to	construct	mathematical arguments, how do students fare? We	presented	a	variety	of	tasks	to	 middle school students in which they were asked to justify their response to each task. In this section, we briefly discuss two primary findings and illustrate these findings using one of the tasks presented to students. The findings will then serve as a springboard for our discussion of ways in which teachers can support the development of students’ understandings of proof.",13,mtms2009-11-206a,,
"The predominant justification  method used by students at all three grade levels was to offer examples as proof that a claim is true. In one task, students were asked to respond to this question and justify their response:   If you add any three odd numbers together, is your answer always odd? ",14,mtms2009-11-206a,,
"The following responses are representative of the examples-based justifications that students provided: •	 “Yes,	because	.	.	.	7	+	7	+	7	=	21;	 3	+	3	+	3	=	9;	13	+	13	+	13	=	39.	",15,mtms2009-11-206a,,

"It is interesting that the seventhgrade student only tested 2 sets of examples but asserted that one would need to test 100 sets of examples to be sure. (See Knuth, Choppin, and Bieda 2009 for a detailed discussion of different types of examples-based arguments.) In this case, the student seems wary of making a conclusive statement on the basis of a small set of examples, which is a good practice; however, the student fails to recognize that using a larger set of examples still does not constitute proof that the sum of any three odd numbers is always an odd number.",18,mtms2009-11-206a,,
"Although a significant number  of the students relied on examples as their primary means of justification for the various tasks, many students were able to provide justifications that treated the general case. The following student responses to the task presented above are representative of one such general argument: •	 “If	you	add	two	odds,	the	result	 is even. An even plus one more odd is odd. So three odds added together always result in odd.” (Grade 6 student) •	 “We	know	that	odd	and	odd	equal	 even. So even (2 odds) added  together with odd equals odd. This shows us that no matter what three odd numbers you add together, the sum will always be an odd number.”(Grade 7 student) •	 “The	reason	that	when	you	add	 three odd numbers you always get an	odd	is	that	odd	+	odd	=	even.	",19,mtms2009-11-206a,,
"That gets rid of two odds. The answer is even, plus another odd would always	be	odd.	This	is	because	odd	+	 even	=	odd.”	(Grade	8	student)",20,mtms2009-11-206a,,
"These arguments use two accepted truths, or well-known facts, for most middle school students: The sum of two odd numbers is an even number, and the sum of an even number and an odd number is an odd number. In constructing their deductive arguments, these students— 1.  employed the associative property  to partition the three addends,  2.  determined the parity of the partial  sum (the first two addends) using the accepted truth that the sum of two odd numbers is even, and  3.  deduced the parity of the final sum  using the accepted truth that the sum of an even number (the sum of the first two addends) and an odd number (the third addend) is odd.",21,mtms2009-11-206a,,
"argument proves that the sum is an odd number for any three odd numbers.

"Students might first determine the number of toothpicks required for the first few shapes (in this case, the first three shapes), and may recognize that the pattern seems to be three times the number of squares in a row plus one (i.e., 3n	+	1).	They	may	then	go	 on to test their generalization with the next shape or two in the pattern. ",38,mtms2009-11-206a,,
An examples-based justification  means that students justify their generalization by stating that it worked for all the cases they tested. ,39,mtms2009-11-206a,,
"Another approach might consider characteristics of the shape itself. For example, we can imagine each square being composed of a C-shaped part  consisting of three toothpicks and an end piece of one toothpick (see fig. 3). ",40,mtms2009-11-206a,,

"Students using this approach are basing their generalization on the mathematical structure of the shape rather than on several examples. (Note that a similar type of structurally based justification can be generated for the problem involving three odd numbers presented earlier, which we will leave as an exercise for the reader.)",42,mtms2009-11-206a,,
"As students share such approaches  (the pattern recognition approach and the structural approach) with the class, the opportunity arises to discuss the nature of the justifications  provided.

"Given the propensity of pattern  recognition tasks (e.g., the toothpicks task) and number theoretic tasks (e.g., sum of three odd numbers task) in middle school curricula, teachers have ample opportunities to help their students develop more mathematically sophisticated means of justifying and proving.

"Pattern generalization tasks, such as the squares-in-a-row example, are a staple of middle school mathematics curricula. In the vast majority of cases, the generalizations that students determine using examples-based reasoning are correct; thus, it is often difficult for students to understand the limitations of such reasoning. One way of helping students develop an understanding about these limitations is to give them tasks in which generalizing from several cases does not lead to a correct generalization (see, for example, the illustration on pp. 266−67 of Principles and Standards for School Mathematics).

"This problem provides an excellent opportunity for a teacher and students  to discuss the contrasting situations. In one case, an example is enough to prove that a statement is false; in the other case, examples are not enough to prove that a statement is true.

In the latter, the use of examples is never enough to prove that the statement is true.",48,mtms2009-11-206a,,
"It is also important to note that examples can prove the truth of a mathematical statement in some situations (i.e., proof by exhaustion). Consider the following statement: There are three prime numbers between 5 and 15.
