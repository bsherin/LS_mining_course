2,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (May 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics",Developing Essential Understanding  of Geometry and  Measurement for Teaching Mathematics in Grades 3-5 provides teachers within this grade band a resource for not only enhancing their understanding of critical aspects within their curricula but also increasing student understanding and addressing challenges.,,
3,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (May 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","The book flows seamlessly, from providing the reader with the rationale for developing a deep understanding of mathematics to detailing the big ideas and essential understandings. The authors then revisit the big ideas as they specifically relate to a studentâ€™s beginning development of mathematical knowledge to provide the reader with multiple viewpoints and applications of the big ideas.",,
4,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (May 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","The reader is encouraged to interact and engage with the material through thought-provoking reflection exercises. Of particular interest to me was reflect 1.23, which involved exploring the relationships between length and area with regard to motion, an idea I had never explored.",,
5,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (May 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Although the intended audience is teachers of grades 3â€“5, as a current middle school mathematics teacher, I believe the ideas are relevant for teachers in grades 6 and 7, as well. With many opportunities for even a seasoned teacher to experience mathematics from a different vantage point, Developing Essential Understanding of Geometry and Measurement for Teaching Mathematics in Grades 3-5 is a valuable resource for increasing content knowledge to provide students with a solid foundation in mathematics.",,

10,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (May 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Anyone can earn a good math grade; just follow these simple steps. This book, useful to both math teachers and students, organizes student strategies into six simple, attainable categories. The authors compare learning math to training for a sport, explaining that a runner would not expect to win a race without preparing first and that just because a team is losing does not mean that the players quit the game. The book advises students on how to adapt to various teaching styles, such as direct instruction and discovery learning. Although written directly to students, teachers can find this book a useful guide to help students organize their math learning.",,
11,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (May 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","The book, however, gives little advice on how to use online resources. It mentions no strategy to find tutorials or worked-out problems. Another weakness is that a sample problem was worked out using cross multiplication, a technique discouraged by many math educators because it skips steps of conceptual thinking.",,
12,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (May 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","These are minor flaws, however. This book gives students the idea  that they can be good at math;  they just have to work a bit more strategically. It gives students hope that they can achieve. As the authors promise, â€œYour aha moment is out there.â€",,

19,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (May 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","This card set addresses the number system as given in the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSM). The authors recommend using the activity as an opening for a lesson or as a review of previous concepts. It may be used with small groups, in learning centers (or stations), or as independent practice. Each card set includes activities for sixth, seventh, and eighth grades, including group roles on the back of each card.",,
20,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (May 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","The teachersâ€™ guide provides sufficient information and detail. It gives a nice overview, a description of student roles, brief information regarding the Mathematical Practices, activity descriptions, an accurate answer key, and a web address for further information. It is easy to read and follow.",,
21,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (May 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics",The sixth-grade set covers rational numbers and focuses on fractions and decimals. The seventh grade set is similar to the sixth-grade set. No problems provided address percentages in either the sixth-grade or seventh-grade sets. The eighth-grade set addresses the prerequisites well. I feel that the seventh-grade set is too similar to the sixth-grade version and uses too many benchmark fractions for answers.,,
22,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (May 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Overall, this card activity seems to be a nice review of conceptual prerequisites for the current grade level concepts, allowing teachers to discover errors and misconceptions before teaching new conceptual ideas.",,

28,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (May 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","This book is divided into ten closely linked chapters containing detailed teacher and student dialogue, work, and thinking. Each narrative comes with a heavy emphasis on ways for teachers to help students share their thinking, as well as what to do when difficulties are encountered. The authors analyze the tenuous relationship between a student understanding how to generalize work with operations and parroting learned computation.",,
29,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (May 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Reasoning and proof are connected and integrated with the ideas of generalization. Elementary school students can engage in different levels of reasoning and proof. Later on in middle school, proof becomes more formal with the need to consider infinity and different number systems.",,
30,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (May 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics",Later chapters provide ties to both middle school issues and algebraic reasoning and notation. Every chapter has a set of reflection questions designed to encourage the reader to reflect on both his or her own practice as well as cases presented in the book. Footnotes offer some mathematical ideas and terminology.,,
31,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (May 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Although there are not a lot of middle level examples, the ideas from this book are extremely important for teachers and teacher educators who want to provide effective teaching and learning in mathematics. The authors present no links to the Common Core State Standards, but they clearly advocate ideas that link directly to both content and practice standards.",,

These two questions are answered through an inquiry-based  vision of mathematics teaching and learning, a vision for developing mathematically proficient students as described by the Five Strands of Mathematical Proficiency set forth by the National Research Council.",,
38,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (May 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Each chapter provides readers with invaluable resources, such as a mathematics rubric to assess studentsâ€™ mathematical thinking; a set of questions, prompts, and suggestions to promote student inquiry and encourage perseverance; and an inquiry-based lesson-plan template to help teachers think about the intricate details in producing such a lesson.  As a former high school teacher, I was intrigued by the nonroutine problems and investigations presented in chapter 3. Many of the resources are aligned and described in terms of five dimensions: problem solving, reasoning and proof, communication, connections, and representations. However, each dimension is presented as a distinct entity and is not discussed in terms of how the five dimensions work coherently to establish an inquiry-based mathematics classroom.",,
39,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (May 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","I recommend Developing Mathematical Thinking for anyone interested in the transformation of a mathematics classroom to a place of inquiry, creativity, and excitement for both teacher and students.

Each chapter explores a particular feature of the language demands of mathematics, such as â€œDeveloping Conversational Languageâ€ and â€œThe Role of Concrete Materials.â€ Within each chapter, the author shares a teaching segment with dialogue from classrooms. The author uses these anecdotes to show the key strategy or concept in action.",,
47,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (May 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","This real-world evidence is presented along with the Rationale from Research, and discussion of mathematics and pedagogy behind the given topic, which all provide the reader with a robust understanding of the language feature. Each chapter concludes with questions for discussions or projects, perfect for use in professional development workshops or in teacher education programs at the graduate and undergraduate levels.",,

Chapters include familiar topics (place value, whole-number operations, fractions, ratios, geometry, measurement, statistics, and algebra). Quick arithmetic activities are leveled and (in the first two chapters and appendix) include directions for using Microsoft ExcelÂ® to generate cards and random numbers. Written by a former primary school teacher for his UK colleagues, games are designed to support the 2014 National Curriculum in  England.",,
55,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (May 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","U.S. teachers should refer to either their stateâ€™s learning standards or the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSM) to align each activity.  Because segments highlight fairly broad age ranges that correspond to the UK â€œkey stages,â€ not U.S. grade levels, this task was time-consuming. Also, the games focus on building procedural fluency, without emphasizing conceptual comprehension. By ignoring the dual intensity of CCSSM, most of these activities seem designed to build mental math agility by rote.",,
56,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (May 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","The cultural disconnect goes beyond philosophical differences between national standards. Team-based games are competitive, rather than cooperative, potentially causing conflict. Students who struggled were sadly eliminated, not supported through differentiation.",,
57,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (May 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Much of the language is uniquely British, like the title Jumpstart! Maths (rather than Math).

64,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (May 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","The student workouts include reproducible sheets, intended to be conversation starters about numeracy and strategies in solving problems. A sample dialogue is provided for each workout as a guide for teachers in facilitating discussion. The teacher-directed activities are separated into three sections: problem strings, as close as it gets, and relational  thinking.",,
65,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (May 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","These five- to fifteen-minute teacher-directed class activities are designed to help build numerical relationships, number sense, and relational thinking through problem solving and discussions.",,
66,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (May 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","I used some of the workouts and teacher directed activities with my seventh- and eighth-grade students. My students felt the layout of the workout pages was confusing to follow. One weakness in the workout sheets is that the lines provided for filling in the blanks are dotted and very small. That said, the teacher-directed activities led to great mathematical discussions among the students in my classes.",,
67,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (May 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics",A major strength of the product is that the design of the questions can lead to great discussions on number sense and numerical relationships.

73,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (May 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics",Math Lesson Starters are daily lesson starters or warm-ups that can be used in grades 6â€“8 classrooms. The tasks are written in a format similar to the new SBAC or PARCC assessments. They take about 3â€“5 minutes to complete and can be used to diagnose studentsâ€™ understandings and misunderstandings.,,
74,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (May 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Although the book is divided into the five CCSS math content domains for grades 6â€“8, the tasks are not aligned to individual standards. Each domain is introduced, and connections are made to the learning in the elementary grades. The introduction then continues with an overview as to what the expectations are for grades 6â€“8. A list of key vocabulary terms is included for each domain, and each domain contains between  12 and 17 tasks.",,
75,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (May 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","I like these materials, as many of the tasks are nontraditional and require deep thinking on the part of the learner. They are rich tasks that can get the students actively thinking at the start of class.",,
76,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (May 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","The answer key is limited and will require teachers to solve the problems ahead of time to anticipate studentsâ€™ responses. I would suggest that by solving all the problems within the domain, the teacher would be able to integrate the problems as warm-ups into their classroom instruction.",,

By starting at the beginning of the material, the students were encouraged by their success. They quickly became engaged in racing to find the solutions.",,
85,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (May 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics",The strength of the material is the classification of activities. The five different styles prevent students from becoming lost in a boring routine. All five styles begin at a foundational level and increase in rigor to build critical-thinking skills. One weakness is that half the product is dedicated to the hints and solutions. Another weakness is the limitation of the reproduction copyright. Some middle school teachers have multiple classes with a total of 75-plus students.,,
