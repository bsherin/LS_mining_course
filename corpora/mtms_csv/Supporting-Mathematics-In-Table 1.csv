0,Supporting Mathematics Instruction through Community - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Raising expectations is nothing new. Every iteration of standards elevates the expectations for what students should know and be able to do. The Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSM) is no exception, with standards for content and practice that move beyond memorization of traditional algorithms to make sense of problems and persevere in solving them (CCSSI 2010, p. 6). Additionally, Principles to Actions: Ensuring Mathematical Success for All (NCTM 2014) establishes expectations for teachers that mirror CCSSM expectations for students. Increasingly, the expectation is for teachers to move away from disseminating facts through lecture-based classrooms to fostering a community of mathematical doers who work together on rich mathematical tasks.",,
1,Supporting Mathematics Instruction through Community - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"NCTM established the Equity Principle, which called for high expectations and strong support for all students (NCTM 2000, p. 12), but how are teachers being supported in this era of increasing expectations? What follows is the story of a yearlong collaboration between a teacher (Morgan L. Trevathan) and a teacher educator (Joel C. Amidon) who explore what it means to provide support for mathematics teachers to improve practice, given the increased expectations and the plethora of external pressures (i.e., high-stakes testing and value-added assessments of teaching) toward a desired vision of mathematics instruction.",,

3,Supporting Mathematics Instruction through Community - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Trevathan and Amidon begin their collaborative journey.,,
4,Supporting Mathematics Instruction through Community - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Trevathan: As a new teacher, I wanted to take this opportunity to work with Joel to improve my teaching in a way that would help my students be successful. The mathematical tools a student possesses are finite and limited, but the ability to find and use the necessary tools to solve a problem is an infinite resource with immeasurable value. Thus, I changed my goal of being an unstoppable disseminator of facts to a disseminator of meaningful tasks that foster the formation of critical-thinking and problem-solving skills. I realized that this transition would have to begin with the classroom environment. I knew raising expectations for students would require collaborative learning strategies. Thus, my journey to create a collaborative classroom community began.",,
5,Supporting Mathematics Instruction through Community - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Amidon: As a teacher educator, I could not have been more pleased at how Morgan chose to improve her practice. For one, I knew a lot about establishing collaborative groups, given it was my primary means of instruction as a mathematics teacher. I also knew that building a collaborative classroom community would shine a light on the types of tasks that Morgan selected for her students. It would allow her to move away from what Palmer called, the dominant model of truth-knowing and truth-telling [Palmer 1998, p. 100, as illustrated in fig. 1], or what Morgan described as being an unstoppable disseminator of facts.",,
6,Supporting Mathematics Instruction through Community - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
7,Supporting Mathematics Instruction through Community - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"To begin our work toward establishing a collaborative classroom community, I gave Morgan some resources I found helpful in developing my own practice. Lamperts work, Teaching Problems and the Problems of Teaching has several chapters that speak to the intentions and logistics of setting up the classroom community for effective collaboration [Lampert 2001]. I also gave Morgan Kagan Cooperative Learning [Kagan and Kagan 2009], another text with tangible practices and structures that could provide a foundation for what Morgan could ask her groups to do in learning mathematics.",,
8,Supporting Mathematics Instruction through Community - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Finally, I provided Morgan with Cohens book, Designing Groupwork: Strategies for the Heterogeneous Classroom [Cohen 1994]. The purpose of this text was to help Morgan consider the inequitable practices that are common when students are placed into groups and how to interrupt/remedy those practices. The book has strategies for establishing a culture of collaboration and troubleshooting common issues. I knew that teachers in diverse classrooms, similar to Morgans, had seen success both in their test scores and in promoting a community of doers of mathematics [Boaler and Staples 2008] when using the principles that Cohen promotes within the book.",,
9,Supporting Mathematics Instruction through Community - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Trevathan: After researching the use of community in the classroom, I dove in. However, I realized from what I was reading that simply placing students in groups didnt necessarily improve instruction. I had to develop opportunities for my students to be put in the position of a collaborative community member.",,
10,Supporting Mathematics Instruction through Community - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The first simple step I took was to create a new layout for my classroom. Individual desks were placed into groups of four, so that by default students would be in groups. Next, I developed a structure that would be used every class period. At the start of each class, each group was responsible for completing a bell ringer [a brief task that is connected to the days objectives] in their group notebook, with different members responsible for recording the work of the group with input from all members.",,
11,Supporting Mathematics Instruction through Community - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Finally, I identified several cooperative-learning structures from Kagan and Kagan [2009] that I wanted to use [see fig. 2], and aligned them with content that I would be teaching at the beginning of the year. This was a way to intentionally introduce each structure as a regular part of what we would be doing in the classroom.",,
12,Supporting Mathematics Instruction through Community - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
13,Supporting Mathematics Instruction through Community - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,THE INITIAL STRUGGLE,,
14,Supporting Mathematics Instruction through Community - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"A desire to build a collaborative class- room community of learners was established, along with a plan for how to build it. But as with finding a solution path for any problem, a strategy needed to be evaluated on the basis of the quality of the solution. The start of the school year meant the implementation of the plan and noticing opportunities for improvement. Although the room looked different and the classroom practices were different, not everything had changed.",,
15,Supporting Mathematics Instruction through Community - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Amidon: My first observation of Morgans class had me excited about what I saw. She had implemented her bell-ringer structure, and students were taking it up as a regular practice of the classroom. More important, I saw students working together and actively talking about mathematics, not just about solutions, but also about how the solutions were reached and why other methods were not used. Later on, I saw Morgan revert back to being a disseminator of facts [see fig. 1], when she provided the classroom with a textbook definition of the vertical line test. She then proceeded to walk her students through a whole-class demonstration on how to apply the vertical line test (via several examples), rather than letting the students attempt to apply the definition or to even use an open-ended task to generate the vertical line test. Regardless, I was impressed by her initial steps in building a community of doers of mathematics. But, Morgan did not match my positive reaction.",,
16,Supporting Mathematics Instruction through Community - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Trevathan: The day Joel observed my class, I was embarrassed by the behavior of my students. They were calling out answers across the classroom and loudly discussing their disagreements over how problems should be worked. I felt as if I had little control, and when I wanted to interject with important information, students were more concerned with their way of doing things. I called Joel soon after to apologize for my students behavior and my poor teaching, but when he began to explain all the good he had observed, I realized that my students were not the problem, I was. They were doing everything that a collaborative learning community should be doing. I simply was not ready for what this looked like, and it was time to change my expectations.",,
17,Supporting Mathematics Instruction through Community - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Joel: Together we figured out that Morgans expectation for what a classroom should look and sound like needed to evolve with her change in practice. This made me think of my own transition to a student-centered classroom and that building the community involved letting go of some classroom control to open up space for students to interact and develop strategies and solutions. It meant letting go of the Initiate-Respond-Evaluate model of student-teacher interaction that does not match this style of instruction. I realized that we talked about the teaching practices, the philosophy, the research, and the logistics, but we didnt talk about the feel of it. What would this collaborative classroom community look like? What would it sound like? What would be her role as a teacher? Morgans philosophy of teaching, and her teaching practice, was ahead of her internalized norms of what was acceptable behavior in the classroom.",,
18,Supporting Mathematics Instruction through Community - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Trevathan: In other words, I needed to familiarize myself with a noisier, more active classroom. Cooperative learning came with cooperative actions. The fact that my students wanted to talk about mathematics was an achievement in itself. My students still trusted me as an educator, but began to trust themselves more as capable mathematics students!",,
19,Supporting Mathematics Instruction through Community - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,THE EVOLUTION,,
20,Supporting Mathematics Instruction through Community - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,The plans made in the summer began to change as strategies used with students were refined. The quest was to move teaching from a dissemination of facts to facilitation of learning.,,
21,Supporting Mathematics Instruction through Community - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Trevathan: My norms for what a classroom looked like and sounded like were not the only thing that needed to change. How I used the cooperative learning structures I selected in the summer quickly evolved once I realized that I couldnt change mathematics to fit these group-learning strategies. However, I could adapt the group strategies to fit the mathematics. Instead of finding the best content to fit the structure, I found the best cooperative learning structure to fit the content. The structure was a teaching tool as well as a way to maintain the classroom community.",,
22,Supporting Mathematics Instruction through Community - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Another example of this evolution was the structure of the bell ringers. The bell-ringer task was always completed within groups, but I would lead a whole-class discussion to review each problem. This seemed to contradict my goal of a collaborative classroom community, and eventually the bell ringer evolved into a completely student-led task that was cooperative learning dependent. Students worked on a problem as a group, checked for group understanding, and discussed any disagreements or multiple strategies used to find a solution. Last, a group member would be chosen by the group to demonstrate their groups work to the class. This allowed students to compare strategies and ideas they discovered in their group with the collective findings of the larger classroom community.",,
23,Supporting Mathematics Instruction through Community - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Amidon: During my observations, I saw Morgan had developed a classroom community where students were comfortable working toward jointly developed solutions and strategies. However, they continued to come to Morgan, or Morgan was inserting herself, as liaison between them and mathematics. For example, students were given a task [see fig. 3] and began to work within their groups. The task and the available tools allowed students to make sense of the situation without much, if any, intervention by Morgan. Yet, I observed students sharing their predictions with Morgan, asking if they were correct. They did the work but were unable to lean on mathematics to make sense of their work. Yet the task was designed to do just that.",,
24,Supporting Mathematics Instruction through Community - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
25,Supporting Mathematics Instruction through Community - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Thus, the image of the classroom shifted from Morgan being an unstoppable disseminator of facts [see fig. 1], to that of an ambassador for mathematics. In other words, the students were connected to each other but they were not directly connected to mathematics [see fig. 4].",,
26,Supporting Mathematics Instruction through Community - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
27,Supporting Mathematics Instruction through Community - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Trevathan: The more responsibility for learning I turned over to my students, the more impressed I became with their efforts. They trusted themselves and their community to figure out any problem they were faced with, though [as Joel pointed out] they still relied on me to be their ultimate connection to mathematics. Instead, I wanted them to interact directly with mathematics while I held the role of classroom facilitator, motivating them to work together, and encouraging them to care about their collective success.",,
28,Supporting Mathematics Instruction through Community - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I now know there is no need to address something that students can figure out themselves. Instead of students being bogged down with completing a task on their own, they now have a small community to share, learn, and grow with while holding each other accountable. As I continue to evolve as a teacher, I plan to increasingly take myself out of the picture to increase student independence. By taking myself out from between mathematics and students, I allow them full access to discovering mathematical ideas for themselves [see fig. 5].",,
29,Supporting Mathematics Instruction through Community - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
30,Supporting Mathematics Instruction through Community - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Amidon: Morgan drew an image [similar to fig. 5]as a goal for her development, but I had not yet seen her enact this model of mathematics instruction, until one of my final observations. In this visit I saw Morgan ask students to find the distance between two points on a coordinate grid. A fairly simple task, she left it open for how the students could do it. After allowing the students time to work, a space was opened by Morgan for students to demonstrate the strategies they generated to the rest of the class. The first student demonstrated his use of the distance formula. In anticipation of Morgan ending the discussion, I was about to step in and explain how to use the Pythagorean theorem, as well. Before I could speak, she directed the classs attention to another students strategy involving the Pythagorean theorem, which allowed students to see the connection between the distance formula and the Pythagorean theorem. Still another student offered up how he found the distance by figuring out the rise [i.e., the change in y-values] and run [i.e., the change in x-values] between the points and then using those values within the Pythagorean theorem. I couldnt believe that I almost assumed the role of unstoppable disseminator of facts and interfered with the classroom community revealing the intended strategies [distance formula and Pythagorean theorem], as well as the novel strategy of connecting slope with finding the distance between two points. Morgan showed me her trust in the classroom community to work with mathematics to develop the necessary strategies, so why couldnt I have that same trust?",,
31,Supporting Mathematics Instruction through Community - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,THE LEARNING,,
32,Supporting Mathematics Instruction through Community - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Trevathan and Amidon conclude their work together.,,
33,Supporting Mathematics Instruction through Community - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Trevathan: Through this process, I learned students can do much more than I thought they could. Furthermore, students in a collaborative community can do even more than the individual student. Learning together allows students to combine forces to meet the rising standards without giving up in frustration or hopelessness. Most important, I learned how to step back and let the community work.",,
34,Supporting Mathematics Instruction through Community - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Amidon: Similarly, this collaboration showed me the parallels between teaching mathematics and preparing mathematics teachers. Just as I gave resources and space for my students to figure out mathematics problems, as a teacher educator, I learned that I needed to provide Morgan with resources and space to figure out problems of practice [e.g., the evolution of the bell ringer and the structuring of mathematical tasks]. In other words, I glimpsed what it meant to provide a teacher support to help meet high expectations and create a collaborative classroom community.",,
