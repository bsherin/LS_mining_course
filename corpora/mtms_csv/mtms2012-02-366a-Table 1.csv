It enhances understanding and retention (Clark 2007). Moreover, writing offers empowerment and ownership (Countryman 1993; Daisey and JoseKampfner 2002).",7,mtms2012-02-366a,,
"To reach a wider range of students,  teachers need to provide a variety of strategies designed to enhance students’ ability to comprehend and  writing process serves as a meaningful and creative avenue for promoting interest and achievement in mathematics (Fello and Paquette 2009). Writing enhances an understanding of mathematics as students organize, reinforce, clarify, and extend their mathematical thinking while explaining concepts to others (NCTM 2000).",8,mtms2012-02-366a,,

"At the end of the school year, students were asked to think about the rising sixth graders and create a How-to book that would help these students learn one topic from mathematics class. The students were required to make a ten-page book. It had to  include a title page, a table of contents, an author page with a student photograph, and a short biography. Students were shown a How-to book produced by one of the authors. ",10,mtms2012-02-366a,,
"This writing assignment was connected to mathematical benchmarks relating to integers, exponents, and linear equations. The students were given a choice of topics, such as order of operations (PEMDAS), exponents, positive and negative integers, algebraic expressions, algebraic equations, and using algebra to solve a story problem. This assignment related to language arts benchmarks, such as setting a purpose for writing, considering an audience for writing, and revising drafts for clarity. Students were told that it was important for them to apply what they learned about content from mathematics class and about writing from language arts class. The assessment rubric included the following categories:  •	 Strategies	and	procedures •	 Mathematical	terminology	and	 notation •	 Explanation •	 Neatness •	 Organization",11,mtms2012-02-366a,,
"The How-to book lesson began  with a discussion about the students’ wealth of mathematical knowledge. We discussed how nice it is to help someone and how scary new concepts can be before you know what to do. Students were encouraged to think about the hints and tips that they had learned when faced with solving problems. In turn, they were encouraged to include these ideas as well as their own tips on the topic in their How-to book. It was also important for students to decide what information they would include and how much writing and how many illustrations should be on each page. ",12,mtms2012-02-366a,,
"The next step of the lesson asked  students to organize their thoughts into an outline. They needed to examine each step and anticipate common student pitfalls. The mathematics had to be correct, and examples were important. It was suggested that students try to include their own personal experiences when possible. It was essential to keep the pages uncluttered so that the reader could stay focused. Students were allowed to work on their books in language arts class and master the content in mathematics class.",13,mtms2012-02-366a,,
"One of the most successful lessons presented during this project was based on the MTMS article, “Traveling from Arithmetic to Algebra” (Darley 2009). In this lesson, storytelling, variables, and number lines were used to promote algebraic understanding. Another helpful resource for this project was an article titled “Mathematics, Art Research, Collaboration, and Storytelling: The High M.A.R.C.S. Project” (Reilly and Pagnucci 2007). It contained examples of curriculum integration to help students better contextualize their learning. Finally, the book 6 + 1 Traits of Writing: The Complete Guide, Grades 3 and Up  (Culham 2003) provided practical tips on writing detailed instructions. ",14,mtms2012-02-366a,,
"The beauty of this project from a language arts perspective was that students had to write explicitly and not assume that their readers had prior knowledge of the topic. Don Pawloski, coauthor and language arts teacher, believes that competent educators realize how important it is to set the stage for the lesson or concept to be taught, so he walked his students through a prewriting activity. He placed a lace-up shoe on a podium and asked students to tell him how to tie the shoe. He followed their directions exactly. After twisting his hands into a knot, he heard students say, “No, not that way!” or “Not like that!” At this point, he stopped and explained the importance of giving clear directions.

"He connected shoe-tying instructions with How-to book writing. He described how students, as authors, would not be able to shout, “Not that way!” to their audience, or readers. Hence, it was necessary to write precise directions. After making the How-to book, one student said, “This project was a good idea to see if we [students] really understood how to do the math problems.” “Why?” asked Pawloski. “You couldn’t make the book until you knew how to do the problems,” replied the student.",23,mtms2012-02-366a,,

"Many students turned in books that were more complex than anticipated. (See some of their title ideas in  fig. 1.) One offering, How to Write an Algebraic Equation, used paper bags to illustrate the topic. The author wrote the necessary steps on paper-bag pages and provided rules inside paper-bag sleeves. Another student’s book explained how to use exponents, which included “fun facts” about the realworld use of exponents. She wrote:  “6³. This exponent can be read six to the third power or six cubed.” Her “fun fact” under the flap read, “You will see things cubed or to the third power when you find volume.”",25,mtms2012-02-366a,,

She then asked her readers to solve new problems using her step-by-step model. The discussion in her book illustrated her own conceptual understanding.",30,mtms2012-02-366a,,
"Several student experiences were  noteworthy. One boy consistently failed to complete assignments. A conversation with his parents was scheduled, before-school support time was given, and lunch-time work opportunities were available. Two days before the end of this assignment, he asked for help to finish his How-to book because he was overwhelmed and discouraged. Coauthor Julie Mallia worked with him for two mornings before school and encouraged him to use the computers at the public library to finish the project. He completed his How-to book independently but, more important, his content was clear, concise, and correct (see fig. 2). He exceeded expectations and learned the pride of accomplishment as a How-to book author. It was encouraging to see the efficacy in his mathematical ability increase.",31,mtms2012-02-366a,,

"education language arts class. Both  felt proud of their contributions (see  fig. 3). Their well-crafted book contained pull-out pages that supplied general rules for solving problems with integers. These general rules would apply to any problem they faced using both positive and negative numbers. This is one example from their book:   If the integers are both positive, then your answer will be positive. Use the sign of the larger digit. If the integers are both negative, then your answer will be negative.",34,mtms2012-02-366a,,
This statement demonstrated that they understood how to write clear directions as well as how to apply the mathematical concept. ,35,mtms2012-02-366a,,
"When students write in mathemat- ics, they are encouraged to develop conceptual understanding. The students not only provided instructions in their books but also included tips and hints that were helpful in developing necessary skills to solve the problems. These tips and hints showed that students were able to synthesize the concept and provide the reader with  their favorite ways to self-check and think about their topic. ",36,mtms2012-02-366a,,
"Students not only ordered their  responses in a logical manner but also reflected on personal experiences. For example, one student shared this hint regarding PEMDAS: “Hint: Always read problems left to right, and make sure that you write out the problem, so that you know what you are doing— you can figure out/check the problem.” Another student included a page titled “Things to Know Before Solving” (see fig. 4). His original explanations described the ways he approached equations before he solved them. This process reinforced the steps, clarified understanding, and showed his algebraic reasoning.  stUdents’ thoUghts",37,mtms2012-02-366a,,
"When the project was initially assigned, many students complained that they thought it would be difficult. However, at its conclusion, they were pleased and proud of their work.

"Students were proud of their books and thought that the algebraic concept they chose to write about was clearer to them after writing the book. They indicated that they enjoyed mathematics and felt that the assignment was fun. Our final quarterly assessment was given after this project was completed. Although it was a multiple-choice test, the students commented that the test was easier because they remembered their How-to book topics. The connections students made between their books and the mathematics test were similar to the connections made by students in the High M.A.R.C.S. Project (Reilly and Pagnucci 2007). Those students wrote a mathematical story rather than a Howto book, but they gained a similar level of understanding from their project. ",43,mtms2012-02-366a,,
"One powerful outcome of the Howto book assignment was the thorough knowledge it gave us of students’ understanding of a variety of mathematical concepts. In fact, when students took the quarterly assessment, the scores came back very low. Mallia was shocked and knew right away that something was wrong. After grading the Howto book assignments, she was able to separate the students who had mastered the content from those who still held minor misconceptions. This assignment gave her the opportunity to reteach to the specific needs of individual students. Those who understood the concept were given the opportunity to move on.
