3,Overcoming the Run Response,"This work stems from a multiyear  initiative designed to embed pertinent dimensions of social-emotional learning (SEL) into preservice teacher education. In selected classes, we are piloting specific strategies designed to develop both— ers’ and students’ emotional reactions to challenging mathematics problems and, more important, the strategies they use to cope with anxiety and to re-engage and grapple with these problems. These coping skills are embedded components of the first essential Standard for Mathematical Practice identified in the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics: “Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them” (CCSSI 2010, p. 6). Self-awareness and regulation are essential, and often ignored, components of mathematical problem solving. This article examines how these skills can be modeled, taught, and learned.",3,Overcoming the Run Response
4,Overcoming the Run Response,"Amy’s reaction to a challenging story problem reflects the anxiety that many of us face when struggling with difficult mathematics problems. Recent research suggests that it is not simply experiencing anxiety that affects mathematics performance but also how we respond to and regulate that anxiety (Lyons and Beilock 2011). Most of us have faced mathematics problems that have triggered our “run response.” The issue is not whether we want to run, but rather how we ultimately turn around and reengage with the problem.",4,Overcoming the Run Response

9,Overcoming the Run Response,I began exploring self-awareness and problem solving with the preservice teacher candidates in my mathematics methods course. Their emotional reaction and self-regulation when faced with difficult mathematics problems provided the initial insights into how to pursue this work with their students. I asked teacher candidates to describe their immediate emotional reaction after reading the following problem from a middle school textbook.,9,Overcoming the Run Response

It was intriguing to hear the wealth of creative ways they used to talk themselves into re-engaging with the problem. They employed a variety of self-talk (Meichenbaum 1977) strategies, internal conversations with themselves, to shape their feelings and behaviors.

27,Overcoming the Run Response,We talked about recognizing how a problem might scare them and how to calm down and take their time. These self-talk strategies acknowledged and addressed students’ emotional and physical reactions to the problem. We then practiced problem-solving selftalk for re-engaging and addressing the cognitive demands of the problem.,27,Overcoming the Run Response
28,Overcoming the Run Response,"We studied the picture of an iceberg that appeared next to the problem in the textbook and decided to try Cory’s strategy and “reread the problem.” I read it aloud to allow struggling readers to think about the problem. Although they were “freaked out” at the academic language, students began to pick out words they knew (“solve what you know”). Mike knew about volume and mass and gave a credible description of density as the size of something in relation to its weight. We discussed the density of their math book compared with the density of a stuffed animal that is in the school’s reading center. Gloria ",28,Overcoming the Run Response

30,Overcoming the Run Response,I commented that students had essentially answered the problem by combining what they knew with what they figured out without ever doing any math. They exchanged the smug looks of students who had beat the system.,30,Overcoming the Run Response
31,Overcoming the Run Response,"Nonetheless,	we	decided	to	engage	 in the math by trying the step-by-step approach next and built the ratio for density, density = mass/volume, from the sentence of the problem. I helped students link mass to grams and volume to cubic centimeters, and they built the ratio for the density of seawater, d = 514 g/500 cc. They eagerly set up the iceberg ratio, d = 267 g/300 cc, on their own. Amy noted that the seawater ratio was more than 1, whereas the iceberg ratio was less than 1, so seawater must be more dense than the iceberg. They had essentially solved the last part of the problem by acknowledging and coping with their emotional reaction, re-engaging, and taking time to make sense of the math. Mike, who initially wanted to “just forget it,”  insisted on staying to calculate the unit rates and prove that they were correct. I asked the students to reflect on their initial reaction to the problem and what they had learned.",31,Overcoming the Run Response

33,Overcoming the Run Response,"Students reflected that the math was	actually	easy.	One	student	commented that “it was just all the words mixed together” that made the problem difficult. They were glad they had not had to tackle it alone and commented that they needed the teacher’s help to understand the problem and help them find the parts they knew. However, when I asked them if they could imagine talking themselves through a problem like this on their own at some point, they agreed that with practice, they probably could use the coping and problem-solving strategies we had tried that day.",33,Overcoming the Run Response

35,Overcoming the Run Response,"This case provides insights into how self-awareness and problem solving may be taught. First, it describes a lesson that could be aligned with teachers’ content objectives at any point in a mathematics curriculum. The lesson could be introduced or revisited whenever students face a potentially intimidating problemsolving task. Teachers should choose the task carefully, finding a problem that they suspect students will find intimidating but that will require skills most students possess and that will offer multiple entry points and solution paths. Within this context, the lesson described in this case is  essentially a discursive frame including three steps: recognizing and acknowledging emotional reactions, developing self-talk and coping strategies, and providing cognitive scaffolding during the problem-solving process.  acKnoWledging eMotional Reactions",35,Overcoming the Run Response
36,Overcoming the Run Response,It is essential to begin the lesson by asking students to describe their emotional reaction to the problem. Figure 1 provides some of the prompts that teachers could use to help students recognize their emotional reaction and its impact on how they approach (or avoid) the problem.,36,Overcoming the Run Response
37,Overcoming the Run Response,"In my many years of teaching  mathematics, I had never explicitly asked students how a problem made them feel. Prompting both groups— teachers and students—to examine their emotional reaction to a problem provided space to discuss what we usually keep hidden. For the many students who reacted with anxiety, the discussion created a sense of safety in numbers as they heard similar sentiments from so many of their peers. ",37,Overcoming the Run Response
38,Overcoming the Run Response,It was important to emphasize that  feeling an emotional reaction to the problem was not wrong. Recognizing one’s feelings and learning to cope with them was the objective. Describing their emotions paved the way for students to try the coping strategies and self-talk described in the following section. ,38,Overcoming the Run Response

43,Overcoming the Run Response,"With both teachers and students, we brainstormed self-talk strategies after discussing their emotional reaction to the problem, both to relieve stress as well as to re-engage with the problem. Prospective teachers in my class had a wealth of such strategies, implying that they had considerable experience talking themselves through both their anxiety and the mathematics. ",43,Overcoming the Run Response
44,Overcoming the Run Response,"Students’ repertoire of self-talk  was far less developed, a finding that speaks to the need to develop students’ coping strategies in mathematics.

What kinds of things did they say to themselves in the process? These questions provide ways to start the conversation. If students are unable to suggest any coping strategies, it is important for the teacher to be ready with suggestions, thereby modeling self-talk both for reducing anxiety (take a deep breath, relax, take your time) and for re-engaging with the problem (reread it, find what you know, work step by step). ",50,Overcoming the Run Response
51,Overcoming the Run Response,"Alternatively, the teacher could use  the preservice candidates’ emotional reactions and self-talk described in this article as a discussion starter for this segment of the lesson. In the lesson described above, reflecting with the students on prospective teachers’ emotional reactions to the problem and the self-talk that candidates generated moved the discussion forward. I believe that students felt that if successful college graduates—future teachers—were anxious when faced with a challenging math problem, then	surely	it	was	OK	for	them	to	 “freak out.” As my middle-grades students shared the same anxiety as my teacher candidates, they were willing to try some of the same coping strategies.",51,Overcoming the Run Response
