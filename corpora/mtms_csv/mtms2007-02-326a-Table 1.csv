"W ITH  THE  rECENT  CALL  fOr  TEACHErS  to foster reading across the content areas (Bean  2000;  NCTM  2000),  mathematics teachers are looking for sources that both support complex mathematical content and are rich in literacy. These sources are often diffi cult to fi nd, especially for middle-grades teachers. One rich source is found everyday in our mailboxes, stuffed in our front doors, and thrown on our driveways. Environmental print (Harris and Hodges 1995) or realtime text includes junk mail, spam, advertisements, and magazines. These items are in great supply and rich with mathematics content (Wallace, Clark, and Cherry  2005).  for  example,  advertisements  often require the calculations of costs, tax, and delivery charges as well as comparisons between buying in bulk and buying individual items. Credit card solicitations require comparisons of variables. In all these sources and in life generally, knowledge of statistics and probability is essential in understanding leading and misleading information.  kArEN kOELLNEr, karen.koellner@cudenver.edu, is an associate professor in education and a site professor at a professional  development  school  at  the  University  of  Colorado at  Denver,  Denver,  CO  80217-3364.

"Using  environmental  print  allows  students  to construct knowledge within mathematics. Since there is  not  one  authority  within  the  text  but  quite  the opposite,  environmental  print  causes  students  to examine rich mathematics that has competing authorities. Students must use their ideas and experiences to support the notion of mathematical discourse, argumentation, and debate. Since environmental print is linked to everyday life experiences, students can see beyond the context of a particular problem and delve into the mathematics implications, particularly when money  is  involved.  reading  takes  on  an  important role, particularly when fi ne print is involved.",9,mtms2007-02-326a,,

"Next,  we  began  to  evaluate  each  piece  in  terms of  its  potential  mathematics  content.  We  used  the NCTM’s content strands to categorize the print into the categories of whole numbers, fractions and decimals, measurement and geometry, statistics and probability, and  algebra.  We  found  our  395  pieces  of  junk  mail covered most topics in a middle-grades mathematics textbook. Each piece of environmental print provides a  realistic  context  or  situation  for  students  and  is not contrived to elicit a particular skill set. Since the questions that arise cover a wide range of mathematics concepts  and  are  not  limited  to  a  particular  skill  or concept, students see mathematics as reality. Moreover, providing  students  with  inquiry-based  investigations  using  rich  mathematics  extends  the  opportunity  for students to develop critical numeracy (Stoessiger 2002); it allows them to think about the power of mathematics and examine how using mathematics to make choices can greatly impact their lives (Steen 1997, 2001).

"Level  1:  Practicing  Problems  uses  environmental  print  as  the  context  to  build  comprehension  of mathematics terms  and  solve  procedural-type problems.  The  content  provides  students  with  the practice  they  need  to  become  proficient  at  reading and  solving  mathematics  problems  (Wallace  and Clark 2005), and the real-life contexts allow students to practice communicating mathematically (roth 1992). Advertisements (see table  1) also work well at this level because students are able to focus on sale prices,  shipping  and  handling  costs,  or  costs  per unit. The Extreme School yard Makeover problem was developed from a Home Depot advertisement listing  outdoor  tile  for  sale.  This  advertisement fit  our  learning  goal  of  working  with  patterns, recursion,  and for patterns. for a level 1 problem, we wanted students to study a pattern and figure out the total number and  cost  of  tiles  necessary  for  a  yellow  and  white design  (see  fig.  1).  This  procedural  problem  was situated  in  a  real  context.  Level  1  problems  that reinforce  procedural-type  mathematics  skills  can be  developed  in  abundance,  used  as  practice,  and match the middle school curriculum material.",52,mtms2007-02-326a,,

"Level  2:  Constructing  Knowledge  about  Problem Solving involves communication (roth 1992) so that students  can  develop  a  broader  knowledge  of  the mathematics  and  extend  the  concept  in  new  ways. Level 2 problems require students to consider multiple perspectives  about  the  problem-solving  situation to  justify  a  final  solution  (Wallace  and  Clark  2005). Solicitations (see table 1) offer the perfect opportunity for  students  to  examine  offers  to  purchase,  switch, or  use  a  product,  service,  or  program.  Comparing solicitations allows students to scrutinize the language of mathematics and encourages students to identify and  examine  variables  and  evaluate  the  offer.  Is  a credit  card  with  a  variable  interest  rate  better  than one with a fixed rate? What other variables must be considered? How do late fees, variable and fixed rates, and  minimum  payments  factor  into  the  decision? Students  have  to  balance  distracting  persuasive language and the mathematics.

"Using  a  newspaper’s  sports  section  to  gather statistics about different teams is another way that environmental print can be used in classrooms. To construct a level 2 problem, a teacher would include not  only  the  sports  page  statistics  but  also  stories about  the  team  that  highlight  issues  with  players: injuries, family problems, legal issues, team money management, and so on.

Students need to assess their school yard and determine where the pathway would be constructed and the specifications of the site. We encourage students to think about creating this pathway for their school, analyzing how it would function, and keeping aesthetics in mind. Students can use  algebraic  reasoning  to  determine  the  number  of tiles necessary for any given length of pathway, the cost for  differing  lengths,  and  the  costs  of  all  materials. Students  are  required  to  design  and  construct  a blueprint of their tiled pathway. This problem integrates mathematics  and literacy  and  requires  active communication among students, an analysis of multiple perspectives, and discussion of a complex budget—all characteristics of level 2 problems.",60,mtms2007-02-326a,,
"Level  3:  Thinking  Critically  about  Mathematics and  Literacy  helps  students  develop  the  criticalthinking  skills  of  solving  problems  and  making decisions as they use the mathematics concepts in new ways (roth 1992). This stage takes the problem to real-life situations and provides opportunities for active  citizenship  and  informed  decision  making. Alth  ough  solicitations  can  provide  the  basis  for level  3  problems,  informational  texts  present  not just  real  but  also  culturally  relevant  problems and  situations  for  students  to  examine  (Wallace and  Clark  2005).  Such  print  may  or  may  not showcase a straightforward mathematics problem, and  discussion  may  be  needed  to  uncover  the mathematics  implications,  particularly  in  articles that  present  misleading  facts  or  figures  or  report potential fraud. for example, elections create many questions regarding informed citizenry that can be explored mathematically. Students are future voters, so researching election data and exploring how the electorate works can introduce them to their roles as informed citizens.",61,mtms2007-02-326a,,
"Level 3 problems can also be extended to servicelearning  projects  where  students  manage  money and materials and see a project from the planning stage  through  execution.

We presented the teacher with a level 1 and level  2  problem  (with  suggestions  for  level  3)  that incorporated environmental print and allowed her to implement the problems in her own teaching style and structure. We selected an item based on relevant mathematics  and  the  level  of  interest  of  students and specifically used electronic text. When working with your own print, teachers can identify a concrete mathematics  idea  in  the  students’  curriculum  and select an aligned piece of environmental print, then construct problems based on the print for students to practice. for example, we wanted students to explore and analyze DvD, CD, or book clubs and the many incentives that companies use to solicit members (see fig. 2). We found an online book club, The Literary Guild Book Club, which provided students with an opportunity to explore working with multiple variables and the concept of averages.",62,mtms2007-02-326a,,

Students were required to solve it by going online and examining the advertisement, including the membership agreement  and  average  cost  per  book.  Conversation and debate ensued as different students shared ideas with their groups and as new pieces of information, sometimes overlooked, arose and impacted the students’  solutions,  reinforcing  the  importance  of reading the information carefully. for example, one group realized that if all 12 books were purchased at  once,  all  shipping  charges  could  be  eliminated, which  impacted  the  cost.  However,  other  students thought  it  was  impractical,  because  most  people would not have money to buy 12 books in one month. Students were required to find average costs of hardback best-sellers and read carefully to identify incentives and shipping and handling. The averages that students found obviously differed by group as they could select whatever books they wanted. However, students were required to justify their reasoning and show how they found their solutions. Students used only  one  advertisement—one  book  club—and  did not have to compare competing programs. ",64,mtms2007-02-326a,,
