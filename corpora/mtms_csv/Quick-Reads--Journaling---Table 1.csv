3,Quick Reads: Journaling: Out with the Old,"Writing in mathematics can have many uses, but one of the most important is for teachers to assess student thinking. Analyzing writing helps reveal to teachers the gaps in students’ understanding. Once teachers are aware of these gaps, they can develop methods to improve their students’ understanding. ",3,Quick Reads: Journaling: Out with the Old
4,Quick Reads: Journaling: Out with the Old,Many students struggle with word problems and other math homework. Their struggles can vary from not understanding what is being asked to not knowing which mathematical strategy or formula to apply to the problem. I conjecture that these constant struggles create negative attitudes about mathematics. Writing can become a problem-solving tool to address such problems. Students can rewrite problems in their own ,4,Quick Reads: Journaling: Out with the Old

Students can then write about the process of solving while they are solving the problem. This form of writing becomes reflective as students reread their entries; this writing also helps students gain deeper mathematical understanding. ",5,Quick Reads: Journaling: Out with the Old
6,Quick Reads: Journaling: Out with the Old,"Writing about and reflecting on  word problems allow students to connect to previously learned concepts and facilitate the act of finding  and correcting their own mistakes  (Marwine 1989; Baxter, Woodward, and Olson 2005; Lim and Pugalee 2004). The most important fact about this type of writing is that there is always something to write about. If the student does not know how to answer the problem, he or she can still write about what is known (the given information), what needs to be known (what the question is asking), and what information is needed to solve the problem (how the given information is used) (Berlinghoff 1989). ",6,Quick Reads: Journaling: Out with the Old
7,Quick Reads: Journaling: Out with the Old,"In my classroom, a weekly journal  question is used to promote writing. The types of questions given to students are compiled from many different sources, such as NCTM’s Problem to Ponder (see http://www.nctm .org/about/content.aspx?id=26070), logic problems from Penny Publications, KenKen® puzzles, sudoku puzzles, and others. I teach mathematics to grades 5-8, and all students receive the same question each week so I can observe their mathematical growth as they progress through middle school. Also, viewing the strategies that students of different ages use to solve the same problem has been informative. For the last four years, students have looked forward to these journal questions.",7,Quick Reads: Journaling: Out with the Old
8,Quick Reads: Journaling: Out with the Old,"Each week, when the journal  question is assigned, the students receive the same directions:  Please respond to this journal  question in complete sentences. Remember to answer the entire question honestly and explain your  reasoning. Your response should be at least three sentences in length. Make sure to be detailed about any resources used and your reasons for the methods you used to solve the problem.",8,Quick Reads: Journaling: Out with the Old
9,Quick Reads: Journaling: Out with the Old,"Giving students these directions  reminds them of the objectives of the assignment. Students do not naturally think about their solution processes, they often just do the math. By the teacher reiterating these directions weekly, students are reminded of the expectations and the requirement to think about what they are doing as they solve or attempt to solve the problem. ",9,Quick Reads: Journaling: Out with the Old
10,Quick Reads: Journaling: Out with the Old,"The most important aspect of  these questions is that the students do not need to find the exact answer. Students are required to write about their solution, and most do, but some students really struggle with mathematics. Allowing the students to simply try the problem removes much of the pressure and stress they often feel when solving problems. The outcome in this situation is often favorable.",10,Quick Reads: Journaling: Out with the Old
11,Quick Reads: Journaling: Out with the Old,"Although some students may have  difficulty finding or writing about the solution during their first few attempts, they are able to gain confidence in their abilities and solve future problems. The most rewarding part of the entire process for me is providing feedback to the students’ responses and reading, “I am so proud of myself ” in a student’s journal. When the students reach this point in their journal question responses, their confidence is transferred to all their mathematical learning.",11,Quick Reads: Journaling: Out with the Old
12,Quick Reads: Journaling: Out with the Old,"Another positive component to  this type of writing in my classroom is the ability to “see” the students’ thinking processes. By reading the responses, I am able to gain better insight into the methods used by my students to reach a solution.

The soldiers will need 83 1/3 seconds to reach the dock (250 ft. = 3 ft./sec. × t). This proves that iowa James will be captured and the point of capture will be determined by solving a system of equations. The equations for iowa James and the soldiers will be d = 2t and d + 50 = 3t, respectively. Solving both equations for distance in terms of time and then setting them equal to one another will give 2t = 3t - 50.

This student’s creative use of “Iowa James,” remarkably similar to “Indiana Jones,” was an imaginative way to capture student interest. This problem requires students to understand how to use resources and calculate time when given a distance and rate of speed. Once students determine the time required to reach a destination, they will find that Iowa James will be captured. They must then determine another method to find the distance from the dock at which Iowa James will be captured. It should also be noted that although the solution appears to require algebra skills, students without these skills are also capable of solving the equation.
