3,Mathematical Explorations: How Tall Is That Tree?,"The American Forests organization documents the largest trees in the  50 states and the District of Columbia. Each state, responsible for locating its largest trees to add to the national database, has its own method for measuring and locating tall trees. Some states rely on amateur tree hunters for nominations. Because much of the initial tree measuring is completed by people who do not have access to expensive technology, it is important that state tree programs have a fairly simple yet accurate way to estimate the height of the trees that people nominate as the tallest. Since the method describled below is easily accessible and uses straightforward mathematical relationships, it has evolved into a popular activity among my middle school students over the last few years.",3,Mathematical Explorations: How Tall Is That Tree?

Readers are  encouraged to submit manuscripts through http://mtms.msubmit.net.  but how tall are they? How can we accurately estimate the height of the trees? Why is it important to estimate the height of such trees? This activity addresses one method for estimating the height of trees that uses similar triangles. A natural extension of this activity is to use introductory trigonometric relationships and clinometers to estimate the height of trees.",5,Mathematical Explorations: How Tall Is That Tree?
6,Mathematical Explorations: How Tall Is That Tree?,The Iowa Department of Natural Resources (Iowa DNR) relies heavily on amateur tree hunters to narrow down the field of potential big trees. It asks that these sleuths use the following algorithm to estimate the height of the trees.,6,Mathematical Explorations: How Tall Is That Tree?
7,Mathematical Explorations: How Tall Is That Tree?," An estimated height can be made using a yardstick. First, measure 100 feet from the tree. Next, hold the yardstick vertically, 25 inches from the eye. Align the zero inch mark on the yardstick at the base of the tree and note the inch mark that aligns with the top of the tree. Every inch equals 4 feet of height. (Iowa DNR n.d.)",7,Mathematical Explorations: How Tall Is That Tree?
8,Mathematical Explorations: How Tall Is That Tree?,Natural questions that arise from this algorithm include the following: 1.  Why does this method of   estimating trees work?  2.  How accurate is this method in estimating the height of trees? 3.  Why is this level of accuracy   acceptable? ,8,Mathematical Explorations: How Tall Is That Tree?
9,Mathematical Explorations: How Tall Is That Tree?,"All three questions can be addressed using the Common Core State Standards in the area of Ratio and Proportion (7.RP.A.2a and 7.RP.A.2b), the Number System (7.NS.A.3), and Geometry (7.G.A.1 and 8.G.A.5) standards in grades 7 and 8, as well as the Standards for Mathematical Practice (focusing primarily on MP.1 and MP.6) (CCSSI 2010).",9,Mathematical Explorations: How Tall Is That Tree?

11,Mathematical Explorations: How Tall Is That Tree?,"To address the first question above, students sketch a picture to model the situation, including labels of the measurements described on the  activity sheet. Thompson and  Chappell (2007) note that encouraging students to use multiple representations at all stages of the solution process helps to make students more mathematically literate. They also distinguish between diagram and picture drawing (Diezmann and English 2001). That is, it is important that students are able to read the directions from the department of natural resources and translate the words into an accurate diagram. It is also important that the students accurately label the measurements given in their diagram. ",11,Mathematical Explorations: How Tall Is That Tree?
12,Mathematical Explorations: How Tall Is That Tree?,"Some students may struggle with  the process of simply reading the diagram and drawing an accurate diagram for the situation described. For students who have particular difficulty with this process, it might be beneficial to first have the students go outside and measure objects using the method described by the Iowa DNR. Making a diagram of the process should help students recognize that similar triangles are formed. Typically, students will generate one of two possible diagrams (see fig. 1). The first simply consists of two right triangles, one inside the other (see fig. 1a). Students may sketch this diagram if they do not take into account the angle of depression from the eye to the bottom of the yardstick. Although this diagram does not take into account this angle of depression, it is a nice starting point for students to translate the situation from words to a mathematical drawing. (In other words, they do not account for the height of the student.)",12,Mathematical Explorations: How Tall Is That Tree?
13,Mathematical Explorations: How Tall Is That Tree?,"In figure1b, two pairs of similar triangles appear to be formed. Students who are drawing this diagram account for the fact that the line of sight of the person measuring the tree is not horizontal to the base of the tree; rather, the line of sight is perpendicular to a spot farther up the tree.

16,Mathematical Explorations: How Tall Is That Tree?,"In both cases, students should be encouraged to verify the relationship between the similar triangles by using the angle-angle similarity postulate, in which each of the triangles formed is a right triangle and the angle formed from the base of the yardstick/tree to the top of the yardstick/tree is the same. Teachers should prompt and encourage students to identify the relationship between the triangles as similar and to explain how they know that the triangles are similar and by which property. This gives students the opportunity to construct a verbal, but important, mathematical proof. The  importance of giving students such proof-making opportunities is outlined by Bieda (2010). By calculating the constant of proportionality as 25:1200, or 1:48, for the similar triangles, students can explain why 1 inch is equal to 4 feet (or 48 inches) of height.",16,Mathematical Explorations: How Tall Is That Tree?
17,Mathematical Explorations: How Tall Is That Tree?,"Students could also discuss the  difference between the two diagrams. Is it acceptable to use the first diagram to estimate the height of a tree, although it does not account for the height of the person measuring the tree? Why is the horizontal line in the second diagram needed to describe the relationship between the triangles?  a discUssion oF accURacY",17,Mathematical Explorations: How Tall Is That Tree?
18,Mathematical Explorations: How Tall Is That Tree?,"It is also meaningful for students to discuss the importance of accuracy in this method of estimating the height of trees. This is only an estimate for a variety of reasons. First, this method only works if people are measuring trees that are no taller than 144 feet. (Remember that the ratio given by the Iowa DNR is 1 in. = 4 ft., so  36 × 4 = 144.) A quick look at the national (and most likely your state’s) list of tall trees shows that many of the trees on the register could have their heights estimated using this method. Tree hunters could only use this method to show that the tree is taller than 144 feet, making it a potential for the tallest-tree list. ",18,Mathematical Explorations: How Tall Is That Tree?
19,Mathematical Explorations: How Tall Is That Tree?,"Second, a perfect right triangle cannot be formed between the tree and the person standing 100 feet away, as depicted in either of the two possible student diagrams. In both diagrams, the measuring tape would have to be farther up the tree, to form a 90 degree angle, instead of placed at the base. Many of the tallest trees in the registry also have a very large girth, magnifying this problem even more. Of course, there is also human error, both in accurately reading the measurements and in holding the stick at a length of 25 inches from  the body. ",19,Mathematical Explorations: How Tall Is That Tree?
20,Mathematical Explorations: How Tall Is That Tree?,"Given each of these considerations  when discussing the accuracy of this method of measuring, why does the Iowa DNR ask its tree hunters to use this method of measuring? Students should be able to realize that this method helps save time for two reasons. First, the directions are fairly straightforward, making it unlikely that a state would receive an overabundance of grossly inaccurate readings. Second, the field of potential tall trees has been greatly reduced when hunting for trees to add to the Iowa and national registry.  diFFicUlties and alteRnatiVes",20,Mathematical Explorations: How Tall Is That Tree?
21,Mathematical Explorations: How Tall Is That Tree?,"The source of frustration with this activity for many students stems from the fact that they are unable to use this method to measure trees that are taller than 144 feet. Although they understand mathematically why they are unable to use a yardstick to measure trees of more than 144 feet, some students discount this method of estimating the height of trees as useless. Many times, students struggle to understand why this method is accepted by the Iowa DNR when it seems so limiting. At times, these discussions have led to exploring other ways to estimate heights, such as with trigonometry.",21,Mathematical Explorations: How Tall Is That Tree?
22,Mathematical Explorations: How Tall Is That Tree?,"I have also used a newspaper  article titled “Amateur Explorers Stalk Extreme Trees” (The Cedar Rapids Gazette 2006) in which amateur tree hunters describe the practice of climbing to the top of California’s redwood trees (most are over 300 feet tall) and dropping a measuring tape to find the height. Those measuring the trees abandoned this practice when a digital clinometer was coupled with a knowledge of trigonometry. This method for measuring trees and the reservations that students express tell the story of the evolution of mathematics. That is, we use a process that is the best method (in terms of time, expense, and accuracy) we know until we encounter a situation that requires a new way of working.
