6,Saving Money from the Ground Up,"3. Nathan is about half the height  of Grampa, so he can pick up the coins at a faster rate. How many coins do you think he could pick up in 1 hour? Explain.",6,Saving Money from the Ground Up
7,Saving Money from the Ground Up,"  b.  If Grampa picked up pennies  at that rate for an entire 8-hour day, how much money would he pick up? 2. Suppose Grampa had an unlimited  pile of coins of all types to pick from, and he picked up 1 coin per second. Explain how he could earn exactly $360 per hour.",7,Saving Money from the Ground Up
8,Saving Money from the Ground Up,"4. Penny, Nicole, and Dallas collect all the coins they fi nd in a single jar. At the end of the year, they donate the money equally among three charities. Last year, there were 57 coins in the jar, and each charity got $6.83. How many of each type of coin could have been in the jar? (Any combination of pennies through dollar coins can be used.) 5. A theme of this Cartoon Corner is that “little things matter.” Explain how each of the following “little things” in math really do matter.",8,Saving Money from the Ground Up

12,Saving Money from the Ground Up,"SOLUTIONS 1.  a.  Expect students to reason that 60 seconds are in 1 minute and that 60 minutes are in 1 hour, so there are 60 × 60 = 3600 sec. in 1 hour. Grampa could pick up 3600 pennies in 1 hour, which  is $36 per hour.",12,Saving Money from the Ground Up
13,Saving Money from the Ground Up,b.  Students will likely multiply   8 × $36 to obtain $288 per day. Some students might use 36 as an addend eight times and get the same answer.,13,Saving Money from the Ground Up
14,Saving Money from the Ground Up,"2.  Before assigning the problem, discuss what is meant by “an unlimited pile of coins of all types.” Expect some students to notice that 360 is ten times 36, so if Grampa picked up 1 coin worth ten times as much as 1 penny (1 dime) each time he bent over, he would be picking up 10 × $36, or $360, per hour. Some students will use a spreadsheet, some trial and error, to find other combinations of 3600 coins that will produce $360. For example, 1600 pennies, 120 nickels,  880 dimes, and 1000 quarters  will yield $360.",14,Saving Money from the Ground Up
15,Saving Money from the Ground Up,FIELD-TEST COMMENTS,15,Saving Money from the Ground Up
16,Saving Money from the Ground Up,"This cartoon and many of the questions were submitted by Andy Reeves, car@ mail.usf.edu, who is retired from the University of South Florida, St. Petersburg. ",16,Saving Money from the Ground Up
17,Saving Money from the Ground Up,"My sixth-grade prealgebra classes approached this Cartoon Corner in a variety of ways. Calculating Grampa’s rate of gathering coins to determine how he could collect $360 and Penny’s, Nicole’s, and Dallas’s charitable contributions generated the most valuable discussions. ",17,Saving Money from the Ground Up
18,Saving Money from the Ground Up,"The first problem set the stage, and students easily identified that there were 3600 seconds in an hour, so Grampa collected $36.Reasoning that  3.  Sample answer: Because Nathan has half the total distance to bend and rise as Grampa, he might be able to pick up twice as many coins per hour as Grampa. That would be 2 × 3600, or 7200, coins per hour.",18,Saving Money from the Ground Up
19,Saving Money from the Ground Up,"4.  Find how to make $6.83 using  19 coins (one-third the number of coins in the jar), and then triple each number of coins. One way to produce $6.83 is with 3 pennies,  4 nickels, 1 dime, 4 quarters,  3 half-dollars, and 4 dollar coins. The coins that could have been in the jar are 9 pennies, 12 nickels,  3 dimes, 12 quarters, 9 half-dollars, and 12 dollar coins. Other combinations are possible.",19,Saving Money from the Ground Up
20,Saving Money from the Ground Up,"5.  a.  Sample answer: The digit 0 does not mean “nothing.” It denotes an amount, even though it is no amount or quantity. In a numeral, it is a placeholder. The number 20 is 10 times the number 2. The value of the 2 in 20 is 10 times the value of 2 in 2. The number 2 is 100 times the number of 0.02. The value of the 2 in 0.02 is 1/100 the value  a dime was 10 times as great in value, Grampa could collect 3600 dimes to reach $360. At this point, it was fascinating to watch groups create different combinations. ",20,Saving Money from the Ground Up
21,Saving Money from the Ground Up,"We had recently completed a unit  on solving linear systems, so one group of students set up two equations: 0.25q + 0.01p = 360 and q + p = 3600. Through substitution, they found that p = 2250 and q = 1350 and then proved it by substituting the quantities into the equation with the values of each coin. They stated that they could continue this process for any other two sets of coins.",21,Saving Money from the Ground Up
22,Saving Money from the Ground Up,Another group realized that the rate  of dimes gathered was 40 cents in   of the 2 in 2. The numbers 1.02 and 1.2 are not equal because the 2s are in different place-value positions.,22,Saving Money from the Ground Up
23,Saving Money from the Ground Up,"b.  Sample answer: A decimal point is used to separate a whole number from the fractional part of the number. The number 15.68 is 10 times the number 1.568. It is 1/10 the number 156.8. A decimal point may be “tiny,” but its placement in a given number can increase or decrease the number by a power of 10.",23,Saving Money from the Ground Up
24,Saving Money from the Ground Up,"6.  Sample answer: Measure the height of a stack of 20 pennies. The height of the stack should be about  31 mm, so each penny has a  thickness of about 1.55 mm, or 0.155 cm. There are exactly  2.54 cm in 1 inch, so there are 12 × 2.54 = 30.48 cm in 1 foot. Therefore, Freedom Tower is 30.48 × 1,776 = 54,132.48 cm tall. This means the stack would be about 54,132.48 ÷ 0.155, or about 349,242 pennies tall. An estimate for the total value of the pennies is $3,492.42, or about $3,500.00.",24,Saving Money from the Ground Up
25,Saving Money from the Ground Up,"4 seconds. Applying this to another set of coins, they determined that 1 quarter and 3 nickels would have the same value and would be collected at the same rate. Therefore, Grampa would pick up 900 quarters and 2700 nickels. The rate could also be achieved based on 80 cents (dimes) collected in 8 seconds with 3 quarters and 5 pennies (or  1350 quarters and 2250 pennies total).",25,Saving Money from the Ground Up
26,Saving Money from the Ground Up,"Students suggested a table to organize data at this point and continued to identify combinations of coins. Of course, there were a few who wanted Grampa to search the pile, pick up and put down coins, and continue until he found the magical $360 coin. Inventing a unique currency was  another imaginative solution that needed to be grounded.",26,Saving Money from the Ground Up
27,Saving Money from the Ground Up,"The savings and charitable contributions by Penny, Nicole, and Dallas were solved based on $6.83 per  19 coins and $20.49 per 57 coins. The first group realized that it needed at least 3 pennies, so 16 coins had to add up to the remaining $6.80. One solution using 19 coins was 5 dollars, 1 half dollar, 2 quarters, 8 dimes, and 3 pennies. The total number of each type of coin was then multiplied by 3. The group starting with $20.49 used the strategy of guess and check. These students began with 20 dollar-coins to use up the most money and knew that they needed an additional 37 coins for the remaining 49 cents. They reached their goal with 3 nickels and 34 pennies.",27,Saving Money from the Ground Up
28,Saving Money from the Ground Up,"Students who took on the challenge problem worked together and found that the stack of pennies was 2.7 cm tall. They divided that number  by 2.54 cm and found that the stack was 1.06 inches tall. Then they calculated that 1,776 feet is 21,312 inches and set up this proportion: 20 pennies 1.06 in.",28,Saving Money from the Ground Up
29,Saving Money from the Ground Up,"pennies = x 21,312 in.",29,Saving Money from the Ground Up
30,Saving Money from the Ground Up,"They then concluded that it would take about 402,113 pennies, or about $4,021.13.",30,Saving Money from the Ground Up

35,Saving Money from the Ground Up,"I tried this activity with a mixture of seventh-grade Common Core and seventh-grade Accelerated students who were in the process of learning rates and ratios. I read through the comic with them to make sure that they understood it, then I let them work in groups on the problems that I  had spaced out on activity sheets. Although a few students struggled with some parts, it was great for them to work with other students who could help explain the processes. ",35,Saving Money from the Ground Up
36,Saving Money from the Ground Up,"A few days before doing this activity with the second group of students, I handed out the famous Shepherd problem: “There are 125 sheep and  5 dogs in a flock. How old is the shepherd?” Students were convinced that problem 3 about Nathan’s height was a trick question. I accepted it as long as they defended their answers, but it certainly opens up the possibility for finding out the relationship between height and picking up coins.",36,Saving Money from the Ground Up
37,Saving Money from the Ground Up,"Most of the class did not have time  to work through the challenge question during their 40-minute block, so I hope to use it another time with the students.

43,Saving Money from the Ground Up,"Here are some extension ideas: •  If you pick up coins for 1 hour  at the same rate as Grampa, how long will it take you to pick up all the coins that would fit along your arm span? (Students could find the dimensions of the smallest circle that would be needed to contain the number of coins they intend to pick up, assuming that the coins did not overlap.) •  Experiment to figure out the relationship between height and the time it will take to pick up pencils. (For example, students could measure each person’s height and time them, and even have people work on their knees to accumulate additional data.) •  Graph Grampa’s and Nathan’s  rates, and discuss the constant of proportionality. Write the equation to represent the data. (Linear equations could be incorporated with the additional criteria that Grampa starts with $x worth of  pennies. Students could then be challenged to find out if and when Nathan will begin to make more money.)",43,Saving Money from the Ground Up
