"Although technology can open mAkiNg Technology Work sStudents need to learn how to use  the door to better teaching and learning, sometimes it is not the most effective tool.",1,mtms2010-04-466a,,
"technology in a meaningful way to become literate. However, this statement should not be viewed as a threat. Teachers should take advantage of technology and what it has to offer. Technology can motivate students and can help them visualize mathematics problems. It can enable them to work on more complex tasks that often involve real-life applications of mathematics. It also allows them to move from mere reproduction to exploration and discovery. Students  are able to work on more in-depth problems and produce higher-quality work. Learning becomes fun for them. However, to fully take advantage of what technology offers, implementing its use in the classroom has to be thoughtful and well planned.",2,mtms2010-04-466a,,
" We have often wondered when it is justifiable to use technology in the classroom and when it is not. Judi Harris, an associate professor at the University of Texas at Austin, addressed the question of when to use the Internet in the classroom (Canter  and Associates 2000). She said that when deciding if there is a compelling purpose for using the Internet, educators should ask themselves two important questions:  1.  Will it allow students to do some- thing they could not have done before?  2.  Will it allow students to do something they could have done before but in a better way? ",3,mtms2010-04-466a,,
We believe the same questions apply to other types of technology as well and could be used when planning classroom activities. ,4,mtms2010-04-466a,,
"It is important to identify the  purposes for using technology in our classrooms, such as to—  •  engage students in discovery and  exploration; •  promote higher-level thinking; •  improve students’ visualization; •  enable students to engage in reallife applications of mathematics; •  prepare students for the demands  of this century; and  •  make mathematics more engaging  and fun.",5,mtms2010-04-466a,,
"With these purposes in mind, various types of technology could be used, such as dynamic geometry software, spreadsheets, scientific calculators, graphing calculator simulators, PowerPoint® presentations, and digital cameras to capture students’ work. The specific type of technology chosen should depend on the goals for the lesson and content that is being taught.  a geoMetRY application",6,mtms2010-04-466a,,
"Dynamic geometry software, such as The Geometer’s Sketchpad®, helps students visualize and explore problems and promotes discoveries. If a computer lab is not available, presentations can be created in Sketchpad  using a laptop and shown using an LCD projector; students can then be led to various discoveries through class discussion. However, if students have access to computers, it is better if they work independently or in pairs on various problems that have been prepared ahead of time. For example, when learning about internal angles of a polygon, students can be presented with the problems shown in figure 1.",7,mtms2010-04-466a,,
"In question 1, students review  the fact that the sum of the internal angles of a triangle is 180 degrees. By transforming the triangle (changing the position of each vertex), students see that the sum of the internal angles of a triangle in a plane is always constant. Questions 2−4 guide students through an exploration of the internal angles of various polygons. They discover that the sum of the internal angles of a quadrilateral is 360 degrees and that a pentagon is 540 degrees. ",8,mtms2010-04-466a,,
"By asking students to search for all  the diagonals of each polygon, they also find that the number of triangles that comprise a polygon is two fewer than the number of sides, or n – 2. Students then use their higher-levelthinking skills and generalize their results for a polygon of n sides. In so doing, they should discover a theorem:   The sum of the interior angles  of a polygon with n sides is  (n – 2) × 180°. ",9,mtms2010-04-466a,,
One student noted:,10,mtms2010-04-466a,,
Fig. 1 Students use geometry software to explore the rule for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon. ,11,mtms2010-04-466a,,
"Question 1: triangle ABC has been drawn. measure each of the interior angles, and find their sum.",12,mtms2010-04-466a,,
(a),13,mtms2010-04-466a,,
"Question 2: Quadrilateral ABCD has been drawn. measure each of the interior angles, and find their sum.",14,mtms2010-04-466a,,

"Question 3: pentagon ABCDE has been drawn. measure each of the interior angles, and find their sum.",16,mtms2010-04-466a,,
(c),17,mtms2010-04-466a,,
Question 4: What is the formula for computing the sum of the interior angles of any polygon?,18,mtms2010-04-466a,,
I used The Geometer’s Sketchpad to find the formula for the sum of interior angles of a polygon. Technology enabled me to get precise measurements and focus on what I was trying to find out. It helped me see how things fit together. It was more fun than if my teacher told me a formula. It also gave me a sense of pride to discover something like that.,19,mtms2010-04-466a,,
"A similar task could be used for the external angles of a polygon. Students open a template with a predrawn triangle, quadrilateral, pentagon, and hexagon; measure all the exterior angles; and compute their sums. To complete the task, they generalize the formula for the exterior angles of a polygon.  selectivelY Using a calcUlatoR",20,mtms2010-04-466a,,
"When working on real-life problems that often involve complex computation, scientific calculators should be used. However, it is important to teach students how to use their calculators effectively and thoughtfully. ",21,mtms2010-04-466a,,
"An activity that can ensure a  thoughtful use of calculators involves a competition between a student who solves all the problems with a calculator and one who calculates by hand. A teacher can display problems one at a time (see fig. 2) using an overhead projector. Students record who solves each problem quicker, the student with the calculator or the individual calculating by hand. Students can then discuss when a calculator is useful and when it is not. In the second step, students work on additional problems individually and record the method they used for solving each problem (see fig. 2b). ",22,mtms2010-04-466a,,
Some students may recognize  that grouping 25 and 75 in the first example and 4 and 25 in the second example allow quick mental-math computation:  (25 + 75) + 44 = 100 + 44 = 144 and  (25 × 4) × 3 = 100 × 3 = 300,23,mtms2010-04-466a,,
"Likewise, in the third example, students may apply the distributive property of multiplication and find 14 × (6 + 4) = 14 × 10 = 140 easy to compute.",24,mtms2010-04-466a,,
"After students have computed all  the problems, we discuss how they solved each and why they used a particular method. Finally, students repeat the same process with another set of similar problems. It is interesting to mention that every time they evaluate expressions with a method of their choice, more students actually use the ",25,mtms2010-04-466a,,

properties of addition and multiplication and rely on calculators less and less. One student commented:,27,mtms2010-04-466a,,
"At first, I wanted to be a calculator and I was disappointed when I did not get that role. I thought that everything is so much easier to do with the calculator but after a while, I realized I could solve some problems quicker without it. It makes more sense not to use a calculator when computation can quickly be solved in your head.",28,mtms2010-04-466a,,

The use of technology allows teachers to engage students in real-life mathematics. Such experiences help students— 1.  develop understanding; and 2.  make meaningful connections  between different math concepts.,30,mtms2010-04-466a,,
"Technology can also stimulate students’ interest. Because real-life problems often require complex computations, visualization, and graphing for data analysis, technology must be used. A task called The Weather Project presents students with an authentic problem and allows them to use technology to make connections, develop understanding, and produce high-quality work. The problem is as follows:  The Croatian National Tourist Board has asked you to make an  informational pamphlet about the weather in the following different regions of Croatia: Dalmatia, Istria, Kvarner, Lika, Slavonia, Central Croatia, and Zagreb. Your pamphlet needs to contain information on the average monthly temperatures, average monthly amounts of precipitation, and the average monthly sea temperatures for the coastal regions. It also needs to explain the Beaufort scale often used in Croatia for describing wind speed. Focus on researching information for one of the major cities in your region. ",31,mtms2010-04-466a,,

Fig. 3 the Weather project’s questions gave students opportunities to apply several different technologies and specific mathematics applications.,33,mtms2010-04-466a,,
"1. Find the mean, median, and mode temperature for each year. Discuss what measure of central tendency is most representative of your data.  2. Some countries use the Fahrenheit scale instead of celsius. throughout the week, read and record the air temperatures using a classroom thermometer using both scales. Find a model that best describes your data, and use it to convert air temperatures in degrees celsius to degrees Fahrenheit.  3. Find the mean, mode, and the average amount of precipitation for the past  three-year period.  4. For coastal regions, create line graphs comparing the monthly sea temperatures  for the past three-year period using both the celsius and Fahrenheit scales.  5. explore the relationship between numbers on the beaufort scale and wind  speed, defined by the formula v = 0.8363B2 where v is the equivalent wind speed at 10 meters above the surface and B is the beaufort scale number.  6. compute the corresponding wind speed in kilometers per hour for numbers 1 through 12 on the beaufort scale.  7. After you compute question 6, show the result graphically.  8. give an example of how one could calculate the associated number on the  beaufort scale for the given wind speed.  9. Discuss the sea and land conditions associated with the beaufort scale.  10. create a pamphlet. ",34,mtms2010-04-466a,,
Fig. 4 Students use graphing technology to express the relationship between the beaufort number and wind speed while completing the Weather project.,35,mtms2010-04-466a,,
Some useful resources include the National Metrological and Hydrological Services and the Republic of Croatia Central Bureau of Statistics.,36,mtms2010-04-466a,,
"Students are asked questions and  must present their data in various ways, including as bar graphs and line graphs (see figs. 3 and 4). They must also use technology (i.e., calculators) to analyze and interpret the data. After the project’s completion, one student made this comment: ",37,mtms2010-04-466a,,
I liked The Weather Project because I was able to work with real data on an interesting problem. The use of technology made it easier for me because I was able to quickly arrive at my model easily and at once compute values in degrees Fahrenheit for each temperature in degrees Celsius and create graphs. I had more time to think how to interpret data.,38,mtms2010-04-466a,,
"One of the greatest powers of technology is enabling students to work with real data on real problems. In so doing, it helps them overcome computational difficulties. Working on real-world problems also allows  collaboration with teachers of other subjects and makes learning even more meaningful and engaging. ",39,mtms2010-04-466a,,
"For instance, while working on ",40,mtms2010-04-466a,,
"The Weather Project, students in science class could explore hurricanes or tornadoes and their impact on people in the affected region. In social studies class, they could research Croatian historical sites of interest and geographical information. During music class, they could learn about traditional dance and music of the various regions of Croatia. ",41,mtms2010-04-466a,,
"After embracing technology in our  classrooms, we realized it not only transformed the way we teach math, but it also transformed the way we assess mathematics. In addition to more traditional methods of assessment, we  grade project presentations, observe processes, monitor students’ thinking while they are working on complex tasks, make notes of students’ abilities to think at higher levels, observe their abilities to reason, and evaluate their reasoning. We also involve parents in the evaluation process by inviting them to come to school to view student presentations and share their observations and thoughts.  conclUsion",42,mtms2010-04-466a,,
"Technology enabled us to engage and motivate students to produce highquality work; to see the relevance, importance, and beauty of mathematics; and involve students in more complex tasks. One student wrote this about the use of technology in math class:",43,mtms2010-04-466a,,
"In my opinion, Sketchpad is a really good thing. It makes math easier and  helps students understand math lessons. On Sketchpad, tasks are tidier, more connected and more precise than they are on paper. I love working on Sketchpad because at the same time I can learn and have fun.",44,mtms2010-04-466a,,
"We continue to require students to work on their computational skills, but we also emphasize estimation skills and the ability to evaluate the reasonableness of results. Technology challenged us to rethink our teaching philosophies, consider the demands of society that are placed on our students, and change our teaching practices accordingly. It helped us become better teachers and improve the quality of mathematics education for our students. ",45,mtms2010-04-466a,,
