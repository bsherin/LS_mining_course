1,Music Cards,"Anne Roche and Doug M. Clarke stone” of middle-grades mathematics (Lesh, Post, and Behr 1988). Students’ success in solving problems involving proportional reasoning is an indication that they have moved beyond additive thinking to multiplicative thinking. However, our classroom work indicates that many students do not reason proportionally in many practical contexts. We discuss a particular task that reveals students’ understanding of and access to proportional reasoning. The task also lends itself to a variety of solutions, leading to a rich and useful discussion in the classroom and to potential applica- pProportional reasoning has been described as the “captions to many similar problems.

3,Music Cards,"Many situations occur in science, mathematics, and everyday life in which an understanding and use of proportional reasoning are essential. Scale, probability, algebra, trigonometry, equivalence, and measurement, as well as percentages, rates, and the geometry of plane shapes are just a few examples. ",3,Music Cards
4,Music Cards,"Clarke, Roche, and Mitchell (2007) claimed that a major reason for teaching fractions is its role in underpinning the development of proportional reasoning. As a result, teachers need to target proportional reasoning concepts regularly and over time to ensure that maximum opportunities are offered to students (Hilton et al. 2012/2013).  the Role oF tasKs in MatheMatics leaRning",4,Music Cards
5,Music Cards,"Various comparative studies have endorsed the focus on rich and challenging tasks. Hiebert and Wearne (1997), for  example, analyzed teaching approaches and tasks in six classrooms in which four teachers used a conventional textbook approach and two teachers used an alternative approach characterized by assigning fewer tasks but spending more time exploring and discussing them. These two teachers presented fewer pencil-and-paper-based tasks, posed more problem situations, and asked students more higher-order questions. At the end of the year, students in the alternate-approach classrooms gave longer responses and demonstrated higher levels of performance on mathematical assessments.",5,Music Cards
6,Music Cards,"Likewise, Stein and Lane (1996)  reported that the greatest gains on performance assessments, including questions that required high levels of mathematical thinking and reasoning, were related to the use of instructional tasks that engaged students in “doing mathematics or using procedures with connection to meaning” (p. 50). They further noted that student performance gains were greater when “tasks were both set up and implemented to encourage use of multiple solution strategies, multiple representation and explanations” (p. 50).",6,Music Cards
7,Music Cards,We also argue that what students  learn is determined largely by the tasks they are given. Tasks designed to prompt higher-order thinking are more likely to produce such thinking than tasks designed to offer skills practice.,7,Music Cards

9,Music Cards,"Two major aspects of our work in recent years have been in the development and use of task-based, one-onone student assessment interviews in the elementary and middle school years (see Clarke, Clarke, and Roche 2011), and our involvement in teaching demonstration lessons as part of a prebrief-demonstration lesson-debrief process (Clarke et al. 2013).",9,Music Cards
10,Music Cards,"In both of these contexts, we  wanted to fi nd or create tasks that were likely to encourage, develop, and elicit student mathematical thinking in contexts that were of interest to students. We were concerned at one point that our tasks in the domain of fractions were somewhat contrived, so we sought to fi nd a context that was likely to be engaging to middle-grades students. This was the impetus for the task described in this article.",10,Music Cards

12,Music Cards,The fi rst author noted that many students in the middle grades were using purchased cards to download favorite songs from the Internet. She proposed two cards with different costs and different numbers of songs that could be downloaded. The cards and the task are shown in fi gure 1.,12,Music Cards

We believe that it also related well with grade 6 and grade 7 statements, respectively, found in the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics: “Understand ratio concepts and use ratio reasoning to solve problems” (CCSSI 2010, p. 41) and “Analyze proportional relationships and use them to solve real-world and mathematical problems” (CCSSI 2010, p. 47).  intRodUcing the actiVitY",16,Music Cards
17,Music Cards,"Our usual way of introducing the task is to discuss the context of music cards and explore students’ experiences with similar cards. After we pose the task, students are given some time to think quietly to themselves about how they might approach the problem before being paired with a partner. We have tended to withhold calculator use for this task in the early stages, finding that the mathematical possibilities and strategies appear to be richer as a result. Encouraging students who finish early to produce an additional solution method provides them with a challenge, allows a check on the original conclusion, and presents the opportunity to connect different aspects of mathematics.",17,Music Cards
18,Music Cards,"As with most rich tasks, this one  yielded evidence of mathematical thinking beyond what we had anticipated. We had not expected that students would be challenged by dealing with remainders and by interpreting fractions, which will be discussed later.",18,Music Cards

31,Music Cards,"Unitizing is an important notion in proportional reasoning (Lamon 2007). In unitizing per song, the student  solves for price per song either by using division or by simplifying fractions, as shown in figure 2. The student might then conclude, “MySongs is a better value because the price per song is less.” See figure 2a for an example of one student’s calculation using this method.",31,Music Cards
32,Music Cards,2. Unitizing per Dollar,32,Music Cards
33,Music Cards,"A student determines how much “song” he or she would get for $1 by dividing or simplifying fractions, as shown in figure 3. The student might then conclude, “MyTunes has fewer songs per $1, so MySongs is a better value.” 3. Unitizing for a Fixed Number of Songs (Greater Than One)",33,Music Cards
34,Music Cards,"A student may use a few different strategies for determining the price of some number of songs (greater than one) for both cards, such as fi nding the least common multiple for 16 and 12 and determining the cost for 48 songs for each card (see fi g. 4a).",34,Music Cards
35,Music Cards,"The student could build a ratio  table that relates number of songs to cost until he or she can compare an equivalent number of songs (greater than one). In this case, the student fi nds that 48 songs cost $72 with the MySongs card and $80 with the MyTunes card (see fi g. 4b). With this  unitizing strategy, the unit is 48 songs as compared with strategy 1, in which the unit is one song, and strategy 2, in which the unit is $1. ",35,Music Cards
36,Music Cards,"In addition, a student may choose to cross multiply; compare the cost of 192 songs for both cards, as shown in fi gure 4c; and conclude, “MySongs is a better value because the price for a fi xed number of songs [greater than one] is less.”  4. Comparing to MySongs",36,Music Cards
37,Music Cards,"The student may determine that the price of MySongs is $1.50 per song (or 1.5) by some means, then calculate the MyTunes price if this same rate ",37,Music Cards
38,Music Cards,"Fig. 4 Unitizing for a fi xed number of songs (greater than one) is explored using three different methods.  224, (a) Using the least common multiple 224, (2.6 )(8.4 ) 5.46 cm .",38,Music Cards

46,Music Cards,(c) Using cross multiplication applied. Lamon (2007) calls this strategy “norming”; calculations may look like the following:,46,Music Cards
47,Music Cards,MySongs: $24.00 ÷ 16 = $1.50,47,Music Cards
48,Music Cards,MyTunes: 12 × $1.50 = $18.00,48,Music Cards
49,Music Cards,"The student might then conclude, “If the MyTunes card were $1.50 per song, then the cost of the card would be $18.00. Because MyTunes is $20.00 ($2.00 more), then MySongs must be a better value” (see fi g. 5a).",49,Music Cards
50,Music Cards,5. Using Intuitive Methods,50,Music Cards
51,Music Cards,"Using intuition, one grade 6 student explained, “Four for four improves the average price.” The student expanded on her thinking by saying that for each card, the songs were worth more than $1 each. However, a user will receive four more songs for four more dollars with the MySongs card. On average, this conclusion means that the price of songs on the MySongs card has been reduced and is therefore the better value card. See such an explanation in fi gure 5b.",51,Music Cards
52,Music Cards,inaPPRoPRiate stRategies 6. Applying Additive Thinking,52,Music Cards
53,Music Cards,"In most cases, a student using additive thinking will consider these cards to be the same value, the reasoning being that there is a difference of four between the number of songs on each card and between the dollar value of each card. There is also a difference of eight between the number of songs and price on each card (see fi g. 6).",53,Music Cards
54,Music Cards,7. Focusing on Face Value,54,Music Cards
55,Music Cards,Statements such as those below do not require any calculations and appear to be conclusions about the value that is printed on the front of the card or appear to focus on one of the measures.,55,Music Cards
56,Music Cards,"•	 “MySongs	has	more	songs,	so	that	 makes it a better value.”  •	 “MyTunes	is	less	expensive,	so	that	 makes it a better value.”   8. Using Remainders Incorrectly",56,Music Cards
57,Music Cards,"This task produced an interesting issue that we had not anticipated: students’ confusion with the meaning of and how to deal with remainders during division. Sometimes a student attempted to calculate the price per song by dividing but was unsure how to deal with the remainder in short division. In figure 6b, the student has incorrectly treated the remainder of 8 as a decimal and then written the result as $1.80. In another case, a student calculated 24 ÷ 16 as 1 remainder 8 and correctly equated this to $1.50. However, when this student calculated  20 ÷ 12 and concluded that it was also 1 remainder 8, he incorrectly deduced that the price was also $1.50. When he used this faulty thinking, the cards appeared to have the same value.  9. Dividing Incorrectly for  Price per Song",57,Music Cards
58,Music Cards,"Sometimes a student attempts to  calculate the price per song but instead of dividing the price by the song, he or she reverses the division and divides the number of songs by the price. ",58,Music Cards
59,Music Cards,"MySongs: 16 ÷ 24 = 0.66,  MyTunes: 12 ÷ 20 = 0.6     or 0.67 (if rounded)",59,Music Cards
60,Music Cards,"The student might then assume that the MyTunes card, which appears to have the lower price, is a better value.",60,Music Cards
61,Music Cards,"As is clear from this discussion, the students’ responses to this task revealed their proportional reasoning or lack of it. However, we also see that their solutions and the subsequent discussion provided other important information about their understanding of and use of remainders, division, fractions, and decimals.

65,Music Cards,What aBoUt sUBseQUent tasKs?,65,Music Cards
66,Music Cards,"Many strategies have emerged in  the students’ work on the music cards tasks. In subsequent lessons, it may be important for the teacher to provide opportunities for students  to consolidate their understanding  of the music cards tasks, using  similar, related problems such as  the following: •	 Create	two	different	music	  cards with identical monetary  values. Explain your reasoning.",66,Music Cards
67,Music Cards,"•	 If	a	music	card	costs	$30	for	 20 songs, how much would  another music card cost that provides 28 songs for the same monetary value? Explain your reasoning.",67,Music Cards

69,Music Cards,Fig. 6 Incorrect strategies provide insight into students’ misunderstandings.,69,Music Cards
70,Music Cards,(a) additive thinking (b) incorrect use of remainders,70,Music Cards
71,Music Cards,"Students can tackle other task types that require proportional reasoning. The following are generally referred to as missing-value problems: •	 A	recipe	requires,	among	other	 ingredients, 4 cups of sugar and  6 cups of flour. You decide to make a larger quantity of the recipe but only have 6 cups of sugar. How many cups of flour will be needed for this larger quantity?  •	 It	takes	10	balls	of	wool	to	make	  15 woolen hats. How many balls of wool will it take to make 6 hats?",71,Music Cards
72,Music Cards,"We also like these problems from Lamon (2006, p. 12): •	 Which	is	more	square,	a	rectangle	 that measures 35 × 39 or a rectangle that measures 22 × 25? •	 Jim’s	mother	asked	him	to	go	to	 her desk and get his dad’s picture and	its	enlargement,	but	when	Jim	 went into her office, he found five pictures of his dad in various sizes.

73,Music Cards,"If proportional reasoning really is  the capstone of middle-grades  mathematics, students need to be given problems in which such thinking is necessary for the solution. Because proportional reasoning is required in many situations in the world around us and has application in other areas of the school curriculum, there is an almost unlimited supply of such problems. We invite readers to start gathering a collection of such problems as we have. We trust that  their use will be as productive and as revealing as has been our experience with music cards.",73,Music Cards
