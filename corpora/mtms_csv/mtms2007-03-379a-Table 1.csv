THE  EDITORIAL  PANEL  IS  PRESENTING  THE  FOLLOWING problem to stimulate submissions to “The Thinking of Students” department. We encourage teachers to try this problem with students and analyze the different ways that students solve it. Feel free to photocopy this problem for use in your classroom. Please send the following if students generate unique strategies:  •  A brief analysis of the speciﬁ c strategy •  Examples of students’ work,5,mtms2007-03-379a,,

"Christie made a cake in an 8 in. × 8 in. pan, which she wants to share with her 3 friends. She wants to divide the cake equally among all 4 people while giving each person a different shaped piece of cake. She wants one piece to be a triangle, one piece to be a quadrilateral, one piece to be a pentagon, and one piece to be a hexagon. Show how Christie can divide the cake. Explain how you know that each person received the same amount of cake. ",9,mtms2007-03-379a,,

"Only 21 and 72 provide a Pythagorean triple that will produce an integral side length  of  75  for  the  hypotenuse.  The sides will measure 21, 72, and 75 units.",11,mtms2007-03-379a,,
"16. 29 meters. The greatest segment will be the interior diagonal of the box, which is from point A to point B in the diagram below. Triangle ABC is a right triangle. The length of segment BC is found by using the Pythagorean theorem for triangle BCD: 122 + 162 = 202. Therefore, BC = 20. Then AB2 = 202 + 212 = 841. Therefore, AB = 29 m.

"A Round This Date in Time 1.  The  number  represented  by  the Greek letter pi begins 3.14, so Pi Day is celebrated on March 14. Some Pi Day celebrants  also  use  the  next  few  digits of pi (3.14159 . . .) and celebrate on March 14 when the clock says 1:59. If March 14 falls on a weekend or during spring break, however, an alternate day to celebrate may be chosen. Teachers can learn more about Pi Day from the NCTM Web site and from Lesser’s article in the fall 2004 issue of Texas Mathematics  Teacher  at  www.tenet.edu/ tctm/downloads/TMT_Fall_04.pdf.  2. The three small triangles represent the symbol of three dots known as an ellipsis.  In  English  class,  this  symbol means that there are additional words that are not shown. In mathematics, it means that there are additional digits that  are  not  shown.  In  fact,  because pi’s digits go on infinitely without falling into a repeating pattern, we always have to end with this symbol, no matter how many pi digits we write.",13,mtms2007-03-379a,,
"3.  results  will  vary  because  of  individual measurement accuracy, but it is hoped  that  all  students  obtain  a  value slightly larger than 3. Taking the class average of the results might produce a number closer to the actual value of pi.  4. Many calculators used in the middle grades,  such  as  the  TI  Explorer,  will have  8-digit  displays.  Various  graphing  calculators  display  10  significant digits: 3.141592654.  5. 22/7 begins 3.142857 . . . , whereas pi begins 3.141592 . . . , so they agree to the hundredths place (i.e., 3.14).",14,mtms2007-03-379a,,
"Pizza Pi, Anyone? 1. The sum of the central angles of a circle is 360 degrees. If the pizza (circle) is divided into 8 equal pieces, then each  central  angle  is  360/8,  or  45  degrees. A piece of pizza that has a 45 degree angle at its point would be 1/8 of the whole pizza (circle). Since the area of  the  whole  pizza  (circle)  is  equal  to pr2, then a piece that is 1/8 of the circle would have an area equal to pr2/8.",15,mtms2007-03-379a,,
"2.  If  the  radius  is  8  inches,  then  the diameter of the pizza is 2r = (2)(8) = 16 inches, and that is the size pizza that they would order. The area of the 45 degree angle slice of pizza is  pr 2/8 = p(8)2/8  =  8p  square  inches,  which  is approximately 25.1 in2.",16,mtms2007-03-379a,,
"3. A can of soda is similar to a right circular cylinder. The formula for the volume of such a cylinder is pr 2h, the area of the base times the height.",17,mtms2007-03-379a,,
"4. If you measure such a can, you will likely get 5.3 cm as the diameter from lip to lip of the top end (which makes the radius 2.65 cm), and about 12 cm as the height. Substituted into the pr2h formula, this yields approximately 265 cubic centimeters, which is considerably less than the printed volume of 355 ml—too much to account for “measurement error.” The main reason for the discrepancy  is  because  the  top  and  bottom ends of the can are tapered; therefore, the measurement is underestimated. A more accurate radius could be obtained  by  visual  estimation  to  obtain  r  =  3.25 cm. Using the value 3.25 cm for r in the formula  pr2h  yields  approximately  398 cm3, or 398 ml, which is closer to 355 ml than 265 ml but is now an overestimate because  it  ignores  the  loss  of  volume near  the  tapered  ends.  Soda  cans  are not filled to the top anyway, so the overestimate makes real-world sense. l solutions to March’s “solve It!” (Continued from page 379)",18,mtms2007-03-379a,,
"Since  the  height  of  the  cake  is  fixed, we only need to concern ourselves with the area of the cake, which is 64 square inches. So each person will receive 64/4, or 16, square inches of cake. The shapes below are examples of 8 in. × 8 in. cakes that  have  been  divided  into  four  equal area  pieces  that  are  shaped  differently. Explanation of each cake piece will vary.
