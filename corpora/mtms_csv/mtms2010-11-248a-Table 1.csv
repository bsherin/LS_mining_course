"Within school mathematics, similarity is a topic that has many connections to real life. Similarity is related to scale drawings, such as those used in architecture, and models, including models of trains, cars, and boats. It is also used to solve problems that involve similar fi gures, which are common in middle-grades textbooks. ",2,mtms2010-11-248a,,
"An understanding of similar  fi gures requires proportional reasoning and the recognition that  multiplication or division, instead of addition or subtraction, is necessary. For example, suppose a triangle has  side lengths of 2 cm, 4 cm, and 7 cm. Multiplying these side  lengths by 2 produces 4 cm,   8 cm, and 14 cm. Therefore,  a triangle with these side lengths would be similar  to the original. However, adding 2 to each original side length will produce a triangle that is 4 cm, 6 cm, and 9 cm. It is not similar to the original, although students often mistakenly think that it is.",3,mtms2010-11-248a,,
"This misconception is not exclusive to middle-grades students. In courses for preservice teachers, many students have diffi culty understanding why addition and subtraction do not produce similar fi gures. These pre-",4,mtms2010-11-248a,,

Teachers are encouraged to submit manuscripts in a format similar to this department based on successful activities from their own classroom. Of particular interest are activities focusing on NCTM’s Content and Process Standards and Curriculum Focal Points as well as problems with a historical foundation.

This misconception may be related to the rule that students learn in algebra: If an equation is balanced and both sides are subjected to the same operation, the equation will still be balanced.",5,mtms2010-11-248a,,
"After several semesters of attempting to explain, in abstract terms, why multiplication and division are necessary where similar fi gures are concerned, I realized that many preservice teachers, like middle-grades students, need visual and hands-on experiences rather than discussion alone. This activity was developed to help pre- service teachers better understand similar fi gures. The same activity could be used with middle-grades students.  a geoMetrY inVestigation",6,mtms2010-11-248a,,
"The activity begins with the teacher asking students to compare the three sizes of triangles in a set of tangrams. If a class does not have access to tangrams, these manipulatives can be printed from the Internet and cut out of paper or card stock. As students  investigate tangram triangles, the teacher may want to briefly review types of triangles, such as right and isosceles. As students place the tangram triangles on top of each other, they should notice that the angles match up, indicating that the angles have the same measurements and that the triangles are similar. Students should be encouraged to describe the triangles in their own words; for example, they may say that the triangles “look the same.”",7,mtms2010-11-248a,,
"Students then draw triangles on centimeter graph paper (which can also be printed from the Internet). However, be aware that photocopied centimeters are not always true to size because of a printer’s variability. In activity sheet 1, students are instructed to draw a right triangle that has legs that measure 6 cm and 8 cm. If desired, students could use a ruler to measure the length of the hypotenuse.",8,mtms2010-11-248a,,
"The teacher could mention that 6, 8, 10 is a “Pythagorean triple.” In other words, 6, 8, and 10 can be substituted into the Pythagorean theorem, since 62 + 82 = 102. Students then add 3 centimeters to each leg and draw a right triangle that has legs of 9 cm and 11 cm. Students are instructed to cut these triangles out and try to match up their angles with the original 6-8-10 triangle. They will see that although the right angles of the triangles match up, the other two pairs of angles do not. Thus, the triangles are not similar. Students repeat the process with subtraction, multiplication, and division on each leg of the triangle. They should conclude that multiplying or dividing the side lengths of a triangle produces a similar triangle, but that adding to or subtracting from the side lengths do not.",9,mtms2010-11-248a,,
a connection to algebra,10,mtms2010-11-248a,,
"In the second part of this activity, students make connections between similar triangles and algebra. For  activity sheet 2, students should be familiar with function tables from elementary school, but a review may be helpful before beginning this part of the activity. Students are given a series of function tables in which the “In” values represent side lengths of an original triangle and the “Out” values represent the side lengths of a new triangle. They are asked to identify the rule that transforms the “In” values to the “Out” values. ",11,mtms2010-11-248a,,
"Once the rule has been identified, students can determine whether the two triangles are similar. They should understand from the first part of the activity that function rules that involve addition or subtraction do not result in similar triangles; function rules based on multiplication or division do. Problem 6 on activity sheet 2 may be challenging for students, since the rule is to multiply by 2.5. Teachers could  give students a hint by suggesting division. For example, 20 ÷ 8 = 2.5.",12,mtms2010-11-248a,,
conclusion,13,mtms2010-11-248a,,
"One of the expectations described in Principles and Standards for School Mathematics (NCTM 2000) is that students in grades 6−8 should use  ratios and proportions to solve problems that involve scale factors. However, data from the National Assessment of Educational Progress indicate that students find these problems to be difficult (Blume, Galindo, and Walcott 2007). Many students do not understand why addition or subtraction fails to produce similar figures. Activity sheet 1 can convince students of this. Activity sheet 2 can help students make connections to algebra as they realize that the ratio of the side lengths of similar triangles can be seen as an algebraic rule that defines a function.",14,mtms2010-11-248a,,
