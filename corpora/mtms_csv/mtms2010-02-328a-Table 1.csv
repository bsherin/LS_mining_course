"RubRics at Play can also provide feedback to teachers, further student understanding, and encourage articulation of ideas.  “Assessment should not merely be done to students; rather, it should also be done for students” (NCTM 2000, p. 22). For assessment to be useful for students, it must give them feedback that will help them move to the next level of proficiency; in other words, it must be formative (Stiggins 2004). However, the most common feedback that students receive, such as number or letter grades, is summative and does not tell students how to improve their performance.  to analyze student work so that they can plan their instruction and provide beneficial feedback to students that will, it is hoped, lead to higher quality work (Bush and Leinwand 2000).

"According to Bush and Lein- wand, a rubric is simply a “hierarchy of standards used to score students’ work” (2000, p. 94). Rubrics are typically used to assess open-ended tasks or projects; that is, they are for assessment that involves more than simply counting the number of correct answers. Rubrics are generally constructed on a four-, five-, or six-point scale.  tyPes oF RubRics",4,mtms2010-02-328a,,
Rubrics can be classified as— •	 holistic;	 •	 analytic;	 •	 specific;	or	 •	 general.	,5,mtms2010-02-328a,,
"Holistic rubrics describe the qualities  of performance as a whole (NCSM 1996). Students typically receive one score, which corresponds to descriptors of their performance. Holistic rubrics allow a student’s work to be judged by the overall performance in which all processes are given equal weight. ",6,mtms2010-02-328a,,

"Thinking processes and mathematical communication are usually emphasized in this tool (Bush and Leinwand 2000). The holistic rubric shown in figure 1 is used with a middle-grades task called “Kid City Park,” which is shown in figure 2. Students are given a map of a park and pricing information from two fencing companies. They are asked to determine how much fencing will be needed and which company offers the best price.",29,mtms2010-02-328a,,
"With this rubric, students would  receive one score (in the left-hand column) and accompanying descriptions of their performance (in the right-hand column). For instance, a score of 4 indicates that the student has determined the correct amount of fencing needed and which company offers the best price. In addition, the student includes a comparison of the two companies and clearly explains his or her reasoning.

"Dividing the rubric in this way allows certain dimensions of the task to be given more weight if so desired. In this rubric, “understanding the problem” and “planning a solution” have a maximum of 6 points and “getting an answer” has a maximum of only 3 points.

Each dimension of the task will be given a holistic score.",35,mtms2010-02-328a,,
"Holistic and analytic rubrics can also be classified as either specific or general. Specific rubrics are created for only one task and have performance descriptors that address only that task (NCSM 1996). For example, the holistic example shown in figure 1 is a specific rubric. It can only be used with the Kid City Park task. Because of its specificity, this rubric is usually easier to use in scoring students’ work. ",36,mtms2010-02-328a,,
"Creating specific rubrics is more time-consuming for teachers, since the rubrics must be created for each task. Many specific rubrics include correct answers so teachers cannot share the rubric with students before completing the task (Bush and Leinwand 2000). ",37,mtms2010-02-328a,,

I planned on using the Science Fair task [Bush and Leinwand 2000; see below] to check my students’ understanding and application of rational number about midway through the unit. I wanted to determine if there were any lingering misconceptions. I liked this task because of the real-world applications of fraction and percent concepts. ,49,mtms2010-02-328a,,
"To adjust my instruction, I needed more information than  correct or incorrect answers. First, I wrote an answer for the task that reflected the quality that I was looking for. To uncover and understand students’ misconceptions, I wanted to include specific information in the rubric about students’ thinking, which meant that I would not share it with students before the task. I took my completed answer to the task and wrote the descriptors that expressed the mathematical reasoning I hoped to see in a top-level response. For the other levels of the rubric, I wrote qualitatively different descriptors that were based on common misunderstandings that students have with fraction and percent applications. When I used it to score the students’ work, I noticed  some changes that I would make to the task and the rubric. Question 1 seemed problematic. Before I gave the task to students, I had difficulty writing qualitatively different descriptors in the rubric, since the only two real choices were for students to correctly divide the rectangle or not. That is why the first three levels of the rubric all say the same thing for this part of the task. ",50,mtms2010-02-328a,,
"Second, it was difficult to understand students’ thinking because they were not asked to explain their thought processes. I had to look at the drawing and see if it appeared to be correctly divided. Many of my students divided the rectangle into a large, a medium, and a small area without considering fraction concepts. It would have been helpful to me if I had adapted the task to ask students to explain their thinking about how they made the partitions in the rectangle. I could then write qualitatively different descriptors on the rubric, which would have also given me more valuable feedback about students’ understandings of fraction concepts. ",51,mtms2010-02-328a,,
"I noticed that many of my students had some misconceptions about basic fraction concepts when working with question 2. Question 3, similar to question 1, did not ask students to explain their thinking. It was difficult for me to determine how students found the percent of the cost each school should pay without their explanations. It was clear that some of the incorrect percents were based on the incorrect fractions from part two of the task. However, other incorrect percents were not related to the fractions in question 2. For example, I could not tell if these students could correctly change a fraction to a percent from these responses. However, I was able to determine that they had some misconceptions about proportional reasoning. ",52,mtms2010-02-328a,,
"Question 4 is similar to question 3 in that it builds on  correct answers from previous parts of the task. I was able to determine that some students could correctly apply the  procedure of finding the cost each school should pay but, in some cases, they based it on incorrect fractions or percents. Other students were not able to apply the procedure. I found the rubric to be helpful in guiding my analysis of student work. I identified some adaptations for the rubric as well as the task that will strengthen both. For example, I would ask students to explain their thinking on all questions. For the rubric, I can add information about specific misconceptions that I identified to the descriptors at each level of the rubric. This will be especially helpful in questions 3 and 4, in which misconceptions emerged that I had not anticipated. I now have a much clearer picture of my students’ fraction and percent understandings.",53,mtms2010-02-328a,,

"General rubrics, on the other hand, use language that is not task specific (NCSM 1996). For example, figure 3’s general analytic rubric could be used with most problem-solving tasks; in so doing, it may save teachers time. However, it may not be as easy to use in scoring students’ work because the language is not task specific. Since a general rubric does not reveal answers, teachers can give it to students before completing the task to help them create quality work (Bush and Leinwand 2000).",61,mtms2010-02-328a,,
cReating RubRics,62,mtms2010-02-328a,,

Using Student Work,64,mtms2010-02-328a,,
Van de Walle (2007) describes a simple double-sort procedure that can be used  with a simple 4-point rubric. It can also be adapted for teachers wanting to create a rubric from student work.  1.  Sort student work into two  categories: “got it” for work that essentially has the target concept or idea and “not yet” for work that contains misconceptions or incorrect procedures.  2.  Take the “got it” work and sort it into two additional categories of “excellent” and “proficient.”  3.  Take the “not yet” work and sort it  into two categories of “marginal” and “unsatisfactory.” ,65,mtms2010-02-328a,,
"Once the student work is sorted, look through the work in each category and note the common characteristics. Decide if the rubric will be specific or general, then use the common characteristics to write performance descriptors for each category. For example, Van de Walle’s descriptions of the performance criteria for each category in a general rubric are shown in figure 4. ",66,mtms2010-02-328a,,
Using the Assessment Task,67,mtms2010-02-328a,,
"Rubrics can also be created from the assessment task, which usually leads to a version that is task specific.  1.  Solve the task and identify the  important mathematics skills, concepts, and processes that are being assessed.  2.  Describe what a top-level piece  of work would include in terms of the mathematical skills, concepts, and processes being assessed in the task. It is always a good idea to actually write a top-level answer to make sure the criteria in the rubric are feasible before using the rubric with students. ",68,mtms2010-02-328a,,

"I gave my sixth-grade students an open-response question and had them solve it. I then asked them what mathematics they thought the task was assessing. The students listed the concepts and skills needed. As a class, we wrote what we thought was an excellent answer to the task. I used an overhead projector so all students could watch the process of constructing the answer including any revisions that emerged from the class discussion. ",76,mtms2010-02-328a,,
"Next, I asked the students to look at our answer and describe what an excellent response would include. We wrote the description for the highest level of the rubric (4 points). Then as a group we described the remaining levels. The students wanted to start with the lowest levels of the rubrics because they thought those were easier. Our state had been using rubrics for several years for state-accountability testing. With the state rubrics, blank responses or completely irrelevant answers receive no credit and responses showing minimal understanding receive a score of 1. My students adopted that language for the lowest levels of the rubric. ",77,mtms2010-02-328a,,
"However, deciding what distinguished an “excellent” answer (4 points) from “good” answers (3 and 2 points) took more discussion to reach consensus. When we were finished, I asked the students to score their own work according to our class rubric. Then I asked them to revise their work to improve their scores.",78,mtms2010-02-328a,,
"I had some concerns about using an entire class period to have my students create this class rubric. However, the performance descriptors, written by the students, provided them with relevant feedback that they used in revising their work. The students had ownership of the rubric and were motivated to revise their work to reach the highest standard. After this experience, I would give my students an open- response task and ask them to think about the criteria that might be included before they constructed their response. Months after creating our class rubric, my students could recall that experience and apply what they learned to creating responses for different tasks. I was amazed at the progress my students made in self-assessing their work.",79,mtms2010-02-328a,,

Rubrics can be beneficial formative assessment tools for teachers and students. Teachers can use them to guide their analysis of student work and provide information about their instruc- tion.

Receiving this type of specific feedback supports students in becoming independent learners	(Guskey	2003).	,137,mtms2010-02-328a,,
