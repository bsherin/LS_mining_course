Analyze discourse strategies and dissect simple classroom tools to maximize student engagement and excitement about math.,1,mtms2012-08-46a,,
"Molly Rothermel Rawding and Theresa Wills you may notice and hear many things:  •	 “I	know	that	the	perimeter	could	 be 22 inches because I arranged the	tiles	like	this.” iIf you go into Ms. Rotherelli’s class, discourse: ",2,mtms2012-08-46a,,
"The	task	is	to	identify	the	dimensions	and	perimeter	of	a	rectangular	 yard	with	an	area	of	24	in.2, and students	are	asked	to	think	of	ways	 that	they	use	area	and	perimeter	in	 their	world.	Students	are	talking	in	 small	groups	about	the	topic,	and	the	 discussions	are	impressive;	conversations	are	thoughtful,	purposeful,	and	 focused	on	the	math.	Students	refer	 to	a	poster	on	the	wall	whenever	the	 •	 “I	found	a	different	perimeter:	 50	inches.	I	knew	this	’cause	I	 thought of a really long rectangle. The	24	squares	are	in	a	long	row.” •	 “My	shape	has	a	perimeter	of	 50 inches, too, but it’s different from	what	she	did.	It	looks	like	 the	letter	C.” conversation	goes	off	track	or	ideas	 need	more	clarity.	The	teacher	walks	 around the room and listens to the discussions. ",3,mtms2012-08-46a,,
"At	one	table,	students	have	different	perspectives	and	are	able	to	 communicate	with	one	another	in	a	 respectful,	productive	way.	The	classroom is full of rich discussions that appear	effortless.	Transitioning	from	 one	activity	to	the	next,	students	are	 in	a	routine	where	math	talk	is	second	 nature.	The	teacher	is	relaxed,	and	it	 appears	that	the	students	are	doing	all	 the	work.	",4,mtms2012-08-46a,,
"A	class	that	has	reached	this	level	of	 discourse	takes	time,	plenty	of	modeling	and	practicing,	and	unrelenting	 perseverance.	Middle	school	students	 generally	excel	at	talking—the	challenge,	however,	is	focusing	the	talk	 around	math.	The	teacher	made	it	look	 easy,	but	a	skillful	observer	understands	 how	much	time	it	takes	for	planning	 purposeful	and	meaningful	tasks	with	 thought-provoking,	rich	questions.	",5,mtms2012-08-46a,,
Simple Moves That Work,6,mtms2012-08-46a,,
"Just	as	students	need	plenty	of	 time	to	practice	skills	such	as	solving	fraction	problems,	they	also	need	 time	to	practice	the	skills	of	discourse	 to become better communicators and stronger mathematicians. Embedded within	discourse	strategies	are	specific	 ways	to	maximize	communication.	",7,mtms2012-08-46a,,
"When	repeatedly	practiced,	students	 learn	to	listen	to	one	another,	give	 a	plethora	of	answers,	and	elaborate	 on ideas. These strategies are a form of	scaffolding;	the	result	is	effective	 classroom	discourse	that	provides	 a foundation for creating authentic classroom discussions. ",8,mtms2012-08-46a,,
"Students	need	time	to	grapple	with	 and	make	sense	of	the	math	in	their	 own	way.	One	way	is	for	students	 to	talk	with	one	another	about	their	 thinking.	To	develop	a	classroom	 culture	in	which	all	voices	are	heard,	",9,mtms2012-08-46a,,
Rotherelli has been most successful when	she	front	loads	the	rationale	 about	the	importance	of	math	talk.	,10,mtms2012-08-46a,,
"As	students	make	sense	of	the	math,	 they	learn	that	value	is	placed	on	their	 thinking.	",11,mtms2012-08-46a,,
"Students	also	learn	how	to	talk	as	 mathematicians by sharing ideas and listening	to	their	peers.	These	conversations, in turn, influence students to become	confident	in	their	communication	skills.	With	teacher	support	 and	coaching,	students	learn	to	take	 responsibility	for	their	thinking.	Students	not	only	embrace	learning	while	 they	make	meaning	of	the	math	but	 also	enjoy	the	process	of	learning	how	 to	communicate	effectively.	",12,mtms2012-08-46a,,
Building classrooM coMMunity,13,mtms2012-08-46a,,
"At the beginning of the year, Rotherelli	builds	trust	and	relationships	 by	asking	students	to	interview	one	 another.	She	models	this	interview,	 placing	emphasis	on	learning	more	 about her students’ interests and experiences.	She	uses	four	categories—achievement,	respect,	fun,	and	 freedom (ARFF) to guide the interview	(McLoughlin	2011):	 •	 Achievement	focuses	on	what	 students	believe	they	do	well.	",14,mtms2012-08-46a,,
Students	can	be	creative	and	also	 imagine	what	they	would	like	to	do	 well.	Answers	will	vary	and	involve	 sports	and	school	to	babysitting	 and	videogames.,15,mtms2012-08-46a,,
•  Respect	highlights	whom	the	 students	love	and	admire	and	the	 manner	in	which	they	show	their	 love	and	appreciation.,16,mtms2012-08-46a,,
•	 Fun	often	incorporates	ideas	from	 achievement	and	also	provides	 insight	into	personal	interests.,17,mtms2012-08-46a,,
•	 Freedom	focuses	on	responsibilities that students carry outside of school	and	the	amount	of	personal	 time	that	they	have	for	themselves.,18,mtms2012-08-46a,,
"These	interviews,	focused	on	the	 whole	student,	build	community	and	 trust	because	they	provide	an	entry	 point	to	make	connections	among	 students.	The	interviews	are	a	great	 opportunity	for	students	to	share	information	about	themselves	in	a	positive	way.	The	experience	is	a	version	of	 student	discourse	and	a	skillful	way	to	 get	even	the	shyest	student	to	open	up,	 thereby	building	his	or	her	confidence	 in	taking	part	in	classroom	discussions.",19,mtms2012-08-46a,,
"Pairs	of	students	interview	each	 other, referring to the teacher’s earlier model	and	also	asking	follow-up	 questions.	These	interviews	encourage students to learn more about their classmates,	discover	connections,	and	 build	relationships.	The	class	takes	off	 because	students	experience	a	sense	 of	community	and	trust	within	the	 classroom.  the Balancing act of equitaBle talk tiMe",20,mtms2012-08-46a,,
"In	Rotherelli’s	classroom,	everyone	 has	an	opinion,	and	every	opinion	 matters. This is a result of deliberate modeling	and	practicing	equitable	talk	 time.	To	achieve	such	a	classroom,	 she and her coteacher demonstrated a conversation	about	perimeter	in	front	 of	the	students.	Students	recorded	the	 amount	of	time	each	adult	talked,	and	 then	the	class	discussed	the	importance	of	equitable	talk	time.	",21,mtms2012-08-46a,,
"The	next	step	is	for	students	to	 practice	having	short	conversations	 with	a	peer	while	monitoring	the	time	 each	person	talks.	When	beginning	 these initial discussions, Rotherelli presents	engaging	questions	that	 connect	students’	experiences	with	 mathematics,	such	as,	“When	were	 you	successful	in	mathematics?”	or	 “Would	you	rather	go	to	school	from	 9:00	a.m.	to	2:00	p.m.	six	days	a	week	 or	from	10:00	a.m.	to	4:00	p.m.	five	 days	a	week?	Why?”	 asking open-ended questions",22,mtms2012-08-46a,,
Rotherelli	poses	open-ended	questions such as this:   The area of this rectangle is 24 in.2. What	else	could	you	know?,23,mtms2012-08-46a,,
"She	knows	that	by	asking	questions	 that	are	higher	on	Bloom’s	taxonomy,	 she	has	more	options,	which	will	result	 in	a	variety	of	student	ideas.	Because	 this	was	an	open-ended	question,	 students	responded	in	many	ways: •	 “The	area	could	still	be	24	in.2,  but	the	perimeter,	lots	of	different	 numbers.”	 •	 “Yeah,	the	perimeter	could	be	  20	inches.	.	.	.”	 •	 “Or	it	could	be	28	inches	because	 this rectangle has sides that are  12	inches	long	and	2	inches	long.”	 •	 “It	depends	if	you	want	a	skinny	or	 squarish	rectangle.”	",24,mtms2012-08-46a,,
"Rotherelli	knows	the	challenge	 of	creating	thoughtful,	provocative	 questions.	She	collaborates	with	other	 teachers to research other resources  and brainstorm a list of questions, which	would	both	interest	the	students and foster math discussions. To	promote	discourse	and	engagement,	she	focuses	on	using	a	variety	 of	open-ended	questions	throughout	 each lesson. ",25,mtms2012-08-46a,,
"She	consistently	uses	a	routine	 that	involves	asking	questions,	looking	directly	at	the	student	speaker	 for	two	seconds,	and	then	scanning	 the room to monitor the class. The purpose,	she	shares	with	the	students,	 is	for	the	speaker	to	address	the	entire	 class.	Other	students	are	more	likely	 to	respond	with	either	a	comment	or	 a	question	when	they	are	being	addressed.	West	(2011)	urges	teachers	 to	“get	kids	to	answer	a	question	in	a	 complete	sentence—a	full	thought.	",26,mtms2012-08-46a,,
"That	alone	will	ratchet	up	your	student	capacity.” if you are Wearing red, you May Be called on soon",27,mtms2012-08-46a,,
"When	trying	new	discourse	moves	in	 her	classroom,	Rotherelli	is	patient	 with	herself	and	her	students.	This	 may	be	the	first	time	that	students	 have	these	opportunities	to	share	their	 thinking	in	a	focused	way.	Rotherelli	 gives	students	a	heads-up	before	they	 are	asked	to	answer.	Two	results	of	this	 front-loading strategy are that students	are	ready	to	respond	to	questions	 and	are	more	confident	when	doing	so.	",28,mtms2012-08-46a,,
Consider	the	following	discussion:,29,mtms2012-08-46a,,
Teacher:	What	else	do	you	know	about	 the	perimeter	of	this	rectangle?	 [She	allows	five	to	eight	seconds	of	 wait	time.],30,mtms2012-08-46a,,
"Teacher:	Okay.	Raymond,	what	are	you	 thinking?	And	Jenny,	I’m	coming	 to	you	next	to	repeat	or	rephrase	 some of Raymond’s ideas.",31,mtms2012-08-46a,,
"Rotherelli’s	strategy	gives	Jenny	 time	to	focus	and	listen.	“Listening	 is	the	bigger	part	of	the	discussion,”	 according	to	West	(2011).	Because	the	",32,mtms2012-08-46a,,
"Just as students need plenty of time to practice skills such as solving fraction problems, they also need time to  practice the  skills of  discourse to become better communicators and stronger mathematicians.",33,mtms2012-08-46a,,
"teacher is deliberately telling Jenny that	she	will	be	called	on	next,	she	 has	the	flexibility	to	either	repeat	or	 rephrase	the	mathematics	in	her	own	 words.	As	students’	confidence	and	 listening	skills	improve,	rephrasing	 becomes more eloquent. Another time, the	teacher	might	say,	“If	you	are	wearing	red,	you	may	be	called	on	next.”	",34,mtms2012-08-46a,,
"The	skill	of	developing	the	 students’	ability	to	listen	and	repeat,	 rather	than	waiting	for	the	teacher	 to	repeat	everything	that	was	said,	 is	practiced	often.	This	strategy	also	 reinforces the idea that students are a	source	of	knowledge,	not	just	the	 teacher.	It	also	helps	develop	a	classroom	climate	that	promotes	respect	 through	listening	and	acknowledging	 alternate	viewpoints.",35,mtms2012-08-46a,,
"hoW do you knoW? When	Rotherelli	poses	the	question	 about	area	and	perimeter,	students’	 answers	resemble	proofs	because	of	 the	thoroughness	of	their	explanations.	",36,mtms2012-08-46a,,
"The	answers,	given	in	complete	sentences, also contain a rationale because she	practices	the	skill	of	asking,	“How	 do	you	know?”	when	she	receives	short	 answers.	This	is	modeled	so	often	that	 students	hold	each	other	responsible	 for justifying their reasoning.",37,mtms2012-08-46a,,
"Both the teacher and students use mathematical	proof	language,	such	as	",38,mtms2012-08-46a,,
Is that always the case? Can you think of a nonexample? Can you convince us how that makes sense?	Rotherelli’s	persistence	with	asking	follow-up	questions	 influences	a	complete	thought	and	 allows	students	to	realize	that	a	fully	 explained	answer	is	the	expectation.	,39,mtms2012-08-46a,,
"Even	when	students	have	an	incorrect	answer,	follow-up	questions	can	 uncover	misconceptions	and	errors.	",40,mtms2012-08-46a,,
"Classroom	talk	is	effective	for	revealing	students’	partial	understanding and	misconceptions	(Chapin,	",41,mtms2012-08-46a,,

"During	a	lesson	exploring	perimeter,	she	asks	a	group	of	students	to	 explain	their	thinking	about	a	shape	 with	a	fixed	area	of	24	in.2. They share different	whole-number	answers,	representing	the	following	arrays:	24	×	1,	 12	×	2,	8	×	3,	and	6	×	4.	However,	one	 student	is	convinced	that	you	could	 get	a	perimeter	less	than	20	inches.	",43,mtms2012-08-46a,,
"To	hear	how	the	student	is	thinking	 about	this	problem,	Rotherelli	asks,	 “How	do	you	know?”	Jasmine	replies,	 “Well,	a	6	×	4	[array]	has	a	perimeter	 of 20. If you used fractions, you could get	a	real	square,	and	that	would	be	a	 smaller	perimeter.”	By	asking	questions,	the	teacher	uncovers	the	various	 layers	of	students’	thinking	about	 mathematics.

Students	did	not	 walk	into	her	class	with	this	skill;	they	 use	the	sentence	stems	that	are	posted	 on the board to stimulate discussion. Rotherelli	supplies	each	student	with	a	 list	of	great	open-ended	questions	that	 can be used in almost any mathematical situation. The list, large enough for students	to	read,	is	posted	on	the	wall.	",58,mtms2012-08-46a,,
"The	students	also	have	a	bookmark	in	 their	binders	with	the	same	information, and they become accustomed to looking	at	the	question	stems	whenever	the	conversation	needs	more	focus	 or	new	ideas.",59,mtms2012-08-46a,,
"Students	also	have	access	to	small	 sheets	of	scrap	paper	or	sticky	notes	to	 jot	down	their	ideas	before	speaking	 publicly.	This	serves	two	purposes: 1.		When	students	have	a	great	idea,	 they	can	remember	it	without	interrupting	the	person	who	is	talking.	 2.
