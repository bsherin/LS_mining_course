2,Using Google Apps to Develop the Mathematical Practices,"Rebecca D. Layton, Jo Ann Cady, and Christopher A. Layton rRecent recommendations for the  teaching of mathematics place an emphasis on the Common Core’s Standards for Mathematical Practice (SMP) (CCSSI 2010). The SMPs emphasize constructing viable arguments, critiquing the ideas of others, reasoning abstractly and quantitatively, and using computational procedures. These skills, including the use of technology, are also being advocated for success in the twenty-first century (Partnership for 21st Century Skills 2011). Many teachers embrace technology (e.g., tablets, SMART boards™, computers, and the Internet), believing that technology has the ability to change the face of education (De Bruyckere, Kirschner, and Hulshof 2016). However, we believe it is how the teacher uses these tools to enhance instruction and engage students that will influence learning.

18,Using Google Apps to Develop the Mathematical Practices,"The first task described was  created to be used as a summative assessment for a data analysis unit. This task, titled “Tom versus Tom,” originally appeared as a Solve It! problem in Mathematics Teaching in the Middle School (Bair and Cady 2014, p. 328):                   Tom versus Tom",18,Using Google Apps to Develop the Mathematical Practices
19,Using Google Apps to Develop the Mathematical Practices,"Two of the more prominent actors over the last thirty years have been Tom Cruise and Tom Hanks.

Present a case, based on data, outlining why one actor’s career has been better than the other.",19,Using Google Apps to Develop the Mathematical Practices
20,Using Google Apps to Develop the Mathematical Practices,"Students determined who was  the better actor, Tom Hanks or Tom Cruise; used data to support their conclusion; and wrote a five-paragraph essay explaining the reasoning behind their conclusion. Because students would be using the Internet to access data about the two actors, Google Apps for Education seemed to be an appropriate tool for this assignment to engage students in the SMPs. Therefore, a Google Doc containing assignment instructions and details, grading rubrics, and Web links to box office receipts and awards data was created and placed on the Google Drive.

Tom Cruise’s total is 8,122,527,813. Hanks’ is  8,937,903,807.” • “Wow I messed up.” •  “Tom Hanks, because he has been in more movies and has grossed  more money worldwide. The average is irrelevant, because it is asking which one is better, which one has made the most money. Therefore Tom Hanks is better.” •  “That is not what it means, it wants to know what in your opinion is a better actor, supported by the facts, not just who makes more money!” school’s computer lab, where students were shown how to access the Google Drive and the Google Docs assignment. The assignment prompt and students’ thoughts are shown in figure 1. Students worked with a partner to review the prompt and share their thoughts using the comment feature of Google Docs. ",24,Using Google Apps to Develop the Mathematical Practices
25,Using Google Apps to Develop the Mathematical Practices,"Comments were public (the entire class could view each comment), and students were encouraged to respond to their classmates’ ideas. This public forum resulted in students questioning others’ comments and realizing that their conclusions should be supported with evidence based on fact rather than opinion. This public forum incorporated the mathematical practice of constructing viable arguments and critiquing the ideas of others (SMP 3). It also held students accountable and allowed them to test their ideas, analyze and synthesize  the evidence provided by others, and stimulate more discussion (see fig. 2).",25,Using Google Apps to Develop the Mathematical Practices
26,Using Google Apps to Develop the Mathematical Practices,"Students then worked in pairs to collect and analyze data to support their conclusion of who was the better actor. The process of collecting and using the data to support their conclusions developed the mathematical practice of reasoning abstractly and quantitatively (SMP 2). The pairs created a five-paragraph essay, complete with a visual display of their data, to submit for the final project. Each time a student made revisions or comments, the document was automatically saved. Thus, both partners could be working on it simultaneously from home and discuss their essay through comments on their Google Doc. The teacher could also view and provide feedback on the essays, which also continued to support student learning and thinking:",26,Using Google Apps to Develop the Mathematical Practices

29,Using Google Apps to Develop the Mathematical Practices,"An actor’s main goal in their career is to be more popular and make more money off of his or her movies, again “Tom Hanks blows Tom Cruise out of the water!” In box office sales Tom Cruise comes in at a staggering fifth place for total box office sales worldwide. Can Tom Hanks beat that? Of course! Tom Hanks destroys the charts by coming in second place worldwide. This is three places ahead of Tom Cruise and is obvious proof that Tom Hanks should take home the title of  “The Best Tom!” (c) Another bar graph, this time, with explanation",29,Using Google Apps to Develop the Mathematical Practices

34,Using Google Apps to Develop the Mathematical Practices,"Student: Based on the information  we observed, Tom Hanks has more overall performance roles than Tom Cruise. Tom Hanks has ten overall performance roles while Tom Cruise only has six. Since Tom Hanks has more overall performances, we can infer that he is a more successful actor. Tom Cruise has less, so he may be not as successful. Here is a bar graph of the overall performances.",34,Using Google Apps to Develop the Mathematical Practices
35,Using Google Apps to Develop the Mathematical Practices,Teacher: What does it mean by overall performances roles? More explanation about the different roles would have been good to add in this paragraph. Why would having more different performance roles make Tom Hanks better?,35,Using Google Apps to Develop the Mathematical Practices
36,Using Google Apps to Develop the Mathematical Practices,"Google Spreadsheets were also discussed as a useful tool to organize, sort, analyze, and display the data. Students were encouraged to use this app to display the data  to support their conclusion. Thus, students engaged in SMP 5 (select from a variety of tools to support their conclusions) and SMP 6 (convey understanding of what the quantities represented). Consequently, a variety of representations were used to display the data in their final projects (see fig. 3). ",36,Using Google Apps to Develop the Mathematical Practices
37,Using Google Apps to Develop the Mathematical Practices,OTHER TASKS ENHANCED BY USING GOOGLE APPS,37,Using Google Apps to Develop the Mathematical Practices
38,Using Google Apps to Develop the Mathematical Practices,"The benefits that Google Apps  provided in the Tom versus Tom math task can be transferred to  many other math tasks. For example, students can construct multiple representations on a Google Doc. Figure 4 provides an example of  this math task in which students were given the graphical representation and had to construct three other representations. Students shared their Google Doc with an assigned partner and gave each other feedback using the comments tool (see fig. 5). This allowed students the opportunity to make sense of their partner’s solution and critique each other’s  work (SMP 3). Students helped  each other see errors they made,  such as defining their variables and making sure their verbal representation correctly represented their  other representations.

39,Using Google Apps to Develop the Mathematical Practices,"Google Apps also has tools that allow students to explore geometry in the real world. In the task shown in figures 6 and 7, students use Google Maps to calculate the area of buildings by decomposing the shape of the building into rectangles, triangles, and other shapes.

47,Using Google Apps to Develop the Mathematical Practices,"(a) (b) using appropriate tools (SMP 5) such as the “Measure Distance” tool, students found the area of the building’s footprint. They explained and justified the area by showing their calculations. Students shared their areas with the class and then categorized the different areas by size to make conjectures about the common square footage of different buildings. In this task, students looked for and made use of structure (SMP 7) to improve their spatial reasoning; after categorizing the buildings chosen by classmates, they suggested ranges for the areas of houses, small business buildings, schools, and other commercial and government buildings. The use of Google Docs to share information with each other increased conceptual understanding and collaboration between students. ",47,Using Google Apps to Develop the Mathematical Practices
48,Using Google Apps to Develop the Mathematical Practices,BENEFITS OF USING  GOOGLE APPS,48,Using Google Apps to Develop the Mathematical Practices
49,Using Google Apps to Develop the Mathematical Practices,"Math tasks that use Google Apps provide many more opportunities to engage students in the use of the Standards for Mathematical Practice. Sharing and working collaboratively on documents increases students’ understanding of math concepts. Students can easily work together, share ideas, and critique one another’s reasoning from home or school. They learn from each other in this collaborative environment. In addition, the teacher has continuous access to students’ work and can provide more personalized and immediate feedback. Google Apps gives teachers and students access to many different tools, creating numerous possibilities to improve instruction and to allow students to show their mathematical understanding.
