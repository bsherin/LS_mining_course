"Mathematics (NCTM 2000), understandings of patterns, relations, functions, mathematical models, and quantitative relationships are recognized as key facets of algebraic thinking. In essence, algebraic thinking “embodies the construction and representation of patterns of regularities, deliberate generalization, and most important, active exploration and conjecture” (Chambers 1994, p. 85). Algebraic thinking should function as a means of shifting from arithmetic concepts to algebraic concepts (Chappell 1997). This shift would have occurred if there exists reasoning about relationships between quanti-",4,mtms2007-12-278a,,
"Vanessa R. Pitts Bannister (vrpitts@vt.edu) and  Jesse L. M. Wilkins (Jay) (wilkins@vt.edu) teach mathematics education courses at Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA 24061. Bannister’s research inter- ests include teachers’ and students’ conceptions of  functions and rational numbers. Wilkins’ research interests include quantitative literacy, educational opportunity, and the teaching and learning of probability and statistics.  “I Can’t Write All the Way to 100”: ties, rather than the specific quantities themselves (Ferrini-Mundy, Lappan, and Phillips 1997; Yackel 1997). Research shows that this arithmetic to algebraic shift is difficult for students (Stacey and MacGregor 2000). Therefore, it is imperative to explore students’ reasoning as they approach problems that elicit algebraic thinking. For this reason, we will present and discuss samples of student work regarding problems that promote algebraic thinking. ",5,mtms2007-12-278a,,
"Rich tasks provide contexts in  which algebraic thinking can emerge. In particular, such tasks shed light on the nature of thinking and reasoning that occurs as students grapple with quantitative relationships. The following problem set (fig. 1) was adopted from the Balanced Assessment Project and adapted by members of the Diversity in Mathematics Education (DiME) project at the University of California at Berkeley (for a similar task, see “Stacking Cups” in Friel, Rachlin, and Doyle 2001). This rich task may help students to— •	 see simple patterns (e.g., the numbers in the second row of the table go up by 4);  •	 connect patterns to a phenomena (e.g., the jump in height of 4 cm corresponds to adding 2 white cups); and •	 interpret a physical situation (e.g., noting that the “lip” of each cup is 2 cm and that one “lip” gets added each time a cup is added).

The following sections examine  student work on the tasks presented in figure 1 and similar tasks. Data were gathered from twenty-four seventhgrade students in a regular prealgebra class in a school district in the East Bay area of California. The focus of this examination is to highlight students’ approaches when they are attempting to think algebraically. ,20,mtms2007-12-278a,,
Examining students’ approaches,21,mtms2007-12-278a,,
"As teachers examine student work, they should ponder patterns of student thinking and what those patterns suggest. For instance, for the figure 1 tasks, 21 students (88%) provided accurate heights of 18 and 22 cm for 6 and 8 cups, respectively. When asked to determine the height for 12 cups, 11 students (46%) provided an accurate height of 30 cm. One student, Brandon, provided the response in figure 2.

Reasoning about quantities— arithmetic approaches,27,mtms2007-12-278a,,
"Students should be supported in their multifaceted attempts to reason about quantities. At the arithmetic level, students may explore specific quantities. Such explorations are generally considered futile when approaching problems that call for generalizations (Stacey and MacGregor 2000), such as a large quantity of cups. For instance, the tasks in figure 4 asked students to expand their reasoning of relationships between quantities and determine the height of any number of brown cups and the height of 100 brown cups.

"Based on this observation, it seems 100 that Brandon used proportional rea3316 soning strategies for a nonproportional situation. His strategy highlights reasoning beyond specific quantities and emphasizes reasoning about relationships between quantities (e.g., 6 cups + 6 cups = 12 cups, then 18 cm + 18 cm = 36 cm). Consequently, Brandon’s line of reasoning may highlight an intermediate phase between ",30,mtms2007-12-278a,,

"2. Find a rule to calculate the height of a stack of any number of brown cups. 3. How high is a stack of 100 brown cups? ing; algebraic thinking; or something in between, proportional thinking? Brandon concluded that the  height of a stack of 12 white plastic cups would be 36 cm. He reasoned that since 6 + 6 = 12 (i.e., 6 cups), and the height of 6 cups is 18 cm, that the height of 12 cups would be 18 cm (the height of 6 cups) + 18 cm (the height of 6 cups), which equals 36 cm (the height of 12 cups). He seemed to be applying an additive part-whole proportional stacking strategy that considers discrete stacks of cups as smaller parts that can be measured and put back together to find the whole instead of one continuous stack, as called for in the problem. In essence, although Brandon did not physically do it, his thinking and solution method seemed to highlight discrete (rather than continuous) stacking, as illustrated in figure 3. Moreover, Brandon’s strategy emphasized facets of proportional reasoning. For instance, if the height of 6 cups is 18 cm, this suggests that the height of 12 cups is 36 cm. Accordingly, he seemed to be  3, 4, and 5 cups. When asked to find a rule, only 3 students (13%) provided an appropriate rule that would allow them to calculate the height of any number of cups, and an accurate height of 304 cm for 100 brown cups. In fact, 14 students (58%) attempted to extend the table of values. However, one student made this comment: “I can’t write all the way to 100. There’s not a lot of room.”",35,mtms2007-12-278a,,
"Another student, who determined the heights for 1 through 100 cups, continuously added 3 cm to extend the table of values. Unexpectedly, when determining the height of 22 cups, this student failed to continue the pattern by adding 5 cm. Because of this arithmetic procedure, an inaccurate height of 306 cm for 100 cups was obtained. This strategy of “adding 3 cm” typifies arithmetic thinking and the futility of such an approach for making generalizations. Here the focus is a case-bycase analysis of the situation at hand. For instance, if the height of 2 cups is 10 cm, this would suggest that the height of 3 cups is 13 cm. This method could be monumental in promoting algebraic thinking, but within the context of arithmetic procedures, it does not render productive mechanisms to determine the height of 100 cups. Teachers should consider the  importance of the additive nature of this pattern yet encourage students to recognize other relationships associated with the situation. For example, encourage students to recognize that each cup adds a fixed amount (one lip height) to the height of the stack, to interpret the physical situation (e.g., see that adding two cups adds two lips), and to think about the body of the cup and the lip separately and the contribution of each to the total height of the stack. Thinking about the situation may help students begin to move beyond thinking solely about specific ",36,mtms2007-12-278a,,

"At the intermediate level, students may shift from explorations of specific quantities to the mechanisms that involve reasoning about relationships between quantities. For instance, students extended the table of values in ways that shifted beyond mere “addition of 3 cm” to approaches that emphasized facets of the proportional stacking strategy. One student, Brianna, provided the solution method in figure 5 for finding the height of 100 brown cups. Brianna seemed to apply an additive proportional stacking strategy. Instead of relying on the picture (as shown in Brandon’s fig. 2 example) to determine “proportional” parts, she used a table to conclude correctly, using an “add 3 to the previous number” pattern, that 25 cups would have a height of 79 cm. However, instead of continuing  the table, she determined the height of the smaller parts. These operations and final answer suggest that Brianna employed an additive part-whole proportional stacking strategy. For instance, since 25 cups have a height of 79 cm, then from her proportional reasoning, 50 cups would have a height of 79 cm + 79 cm, or 158 cm, and so 100 cups would have a height of 158 cm + 158 cm, or 316 cm. Brianna seemed to be relating the problem to the following proportional relationship:  = × 6 2 18 2 12 36 18 25 79 25 2 79 2 50 2 158 2 100 3316",42,mtms2007-12-278a,,

"Ernest, presented the solution method shown in figure 6 for finding the height of 100 brown cups. Ernest seemed to apply a multiplicative partwhole proportional stacking strategy. By continuing his table for the brown  cups by applying his “add 3” pattern, he correctly concluded that 10 cups would have a height of 34 cm. From here, he decided that since one stack of 10 cups is 34 cm, then 10 stacks of 10 cups should be 340 cm, as shown in his multiplication of 34 × 10.",45,mtms2007-12-278a,,
"Another student, Julius, presented  the solution method in figure 7 for finding the height of 100 brown cups. Julius used a mixture of additive and multiplicative reasoning when applying an additive and multiplicative part-whole proportional stacking strategy. He used an “add 3 cm” pattern to conclude that the height of 20 brown cups would be 64 cm. The following is a recreation of Julius’ steps in concluding that the height of 100 cups would be 1,024 cm (see fig. 7). For the “parts” of the stack, he used a part size of 20 cups and continually added parts of 20 cups until he reached 100 cups. However, in determining the height, instead of adding 64 cm, he continued doubling the height of each part until he found 1,024 cm for the height of the stack of 100 cups.",46,mtms2007-12-278a,,
"The shift from arithmetic thinking to algebraic thinking is difficult. However, as shown by the students’ reasoning presented here, the shift may not be absolute but instead involve an intermediate phase of thinking that is characterized by aspects of both reasoning about specific quantities (arithmetic) and reasoning about relationships between quantities (algebraic). The proportional stacking strategy represents one example of such an intermediate phase of thinking. As outlined here, there are various ways that students can highlight facets of this strategy. For instance, Brandon and Brianna presented strategies that emphasized additive features, whereas Ernest’s strategy highlighted multiplicative features. Julius, alternatively, presented a strategy that accentuated both additive and multiplicative features. ",47,mtms2007-12-278a,,

"When teachers are presented with student work that highlights arithmetic or intermediate phases of thinking, they should be cautious. It is important not to dismiss students’ approaches outright but recognize that these phases of thinking may represent students’ emerging attempts to think algebraically. For example, although the students seemed to assimilate their proportional reasoning approaches to nonproportional situations, the students’ use of proportional stacking strategies may represent a shift from purely arithmetic thinking beyond additive procedures on specific quantities to also involve reasoning about relationships between quantities—notions of algebraic thinking.",50,mtms2007-12-278a,,
