Students explore the concept of expected value by examining the television game show Deal or No Deal.,11,mtms2009-02-330a,,
"tThe NBC game show Deal or No Deal  has captured my attention—and the interest of my middle school students. “Did you see that guy on the show last night? He had eight million-dollar cases on the board. Eight! But he didn’t win any of them!” announced Gina, as she flew into my classroom one particular day. ",12,mtms2009-02-330a,,
"This show presented an opportunity to explore the mathematical concept of expected value. Conducting a short unit on expected value using Deal or No Deal affords you and your students an opportunity to explore probability and mean in a fun and familiar real-world context. In so doing, you will be connecting both the Data Analysis and Probability Standard and the Connections Standard, which are discussed in Principles and Standards for School Mathematics (NCTM 2000).",13,mtms2009-02-330a,,
expected Value,14,mtms2009-02-330a,,
"Expected value (EV) is a concept in probability theory that has special relevance in the city where I teach: Las Vegas. We are surrounded by casinos— with new ones under construction all the time—and my students are especially curious about the industry that serves as the financial backbone of our community. Without a solid understanding of EV, the gambling industry (or “gaming” industry, as it is called here) could not function profitably. ",15,mtms2009-02-330a,,
"EV “represents how much money a player can expect to win or lose in the long run on a particular wager” (Hannum and Cabot 2005, p. 17). Mathematically, the EV of a discrete random variable is the sum of the value of each possible outcome multiplied by  the probability of the outcome’s occurrence. Symbolically, ",16,mtms2009-02-330a,,
"For example, let’s pretend that a casino offers some quick and easy games of chance. This casino runs a “Lucky Three” dice game that pays a player 4-to-1 (pays four times the bet, and the bet is returned) if the roll is a 3. According to these rules, the player buying in with a $1.00 bet has a one in six chance of winning $4.00 and a five in six chance of losing $1.00. Thus, the EV is computed in this way:",17,mtms2009-02-330a,,

"Hannum and Cabot (2005, p. 17)  tell the story of an individual who played the $1.00 slot machines and who later filed a complaint with the Nevada State Gaming Control Board. She lost $100.00 on a machine touting “98% Payback” and she “expected” to win $98.00 back, losing only $2.00 over the period of play. On each $1.00 bet, the EV of such a machine is −$0.02, from the player’s perspective, and $0.02, from the casino’s perspective. Had she played for many hours or days—or averaged her performance with other slot patrons in the vicinity—she would more closely have approximated the promised 98 percent payback. ",20,mtms2009-02-330a,,
"It is obvious why casinos rely  heavily on EV calculations: These calculations ensure that the money held by the house (the casino) exceeds the money won by gaming patrons. This plan keeps the casino in business for yet another day. It is somewhat  surprising to realize that casinos ensure their advantage not only by setting odds for table games but also by controlling hit frequencies for slot machines as well. My students had assumed that the probability of a slot hit was based on pure chance; it is not. In fact, “the probability of obtaining three 7s can be set by the computer to be substantially more remote,” than its actual mathematical likelihood (Hannum and Cabot 2005, p. 63).",21,mtms2009-02-330a,,

"Deal or No Deal is a chance-based television game show in which a player is given a gallery of twenty-six closed, money-filled briefcases, ranging in value from $0.1 to $1 million (fig. 1). The player randomly picks and eliminates cases with the possibility of ending up with the milliondollar prize. The game is simple in that no content knowledge or skill is required to play. However, an understanding of expected value can help a player decide to continue opening cases or take the money and run. ",23,mtms2009-02-330a,,

"Deal or No Deal works as follows: A player selects a case as his or her own (“Your briefcase”) and keeps the case closed throughout the game. In round 1, the player is asked to open six cases. As each case is opened, the cash amount held by the case is revealed and removed from the game board. After the sixth case is opened, a “Banker” offers the player an amount of money to stop playing. This amount is based on the amounts still in play, namely, the possible amount in the chosen briefcase. The player may accept the offer (“Deal”) and exit the game or reject the offer (“No Deal”) and continue to the next round. In each successive round, the player opens fewer cases: five cases in round 2; four in round 3; three in round 4; two in round 5; and one each in rounds 6, 7, 8, and 9. Following round 9, two briefcases remain: the player’s case and one case in the gallery. The player then opens his or her own case to reveal the prize money.

"EV following each round is the mean of the values of the unopened cases. When a student begins play, he  or she selects a case but does not know its value. Even though this case (“Your briefcase”) is taken out of the gallery, it is still mathematically in play because its value is not removed  from the game board. Thus, in round 1, when the student opens the first case and records the value of the case amount, twenty-five unopened cases remain (out of the total twenty-six cases in the gallery).",39,mtms2009-02-330a,,

At the end of round 1, the Banker called with an offer of $13,000.00. How does the student determine whether this is a good offer? He or she computes the current EV of the game by finding the mean of the unopened case values and then compares the EV with the offer. ",41,mtms2009-02-330a,,
"Students can compute the EV following each round by using a calculator or by constructing a formula and pasting it into the cells of the EV column using an Excel spreadsheet. Figure 3 shows how the formula appears after round 1, round 2, and round 3. The EV formula in Excel is computed as the initial total value of the game ($3,418,416.00) minus  the sum of all opened “Case Values,” divided by the number of “Cases Unopened.” (Note that this formula is, in fact, the mean of the values of the unopened cases.)

Students will realize that the Banker is offering a deal substantially below the EV (what the player should “expect” to win), but why? My students correctly deduced that the Banker was intentionally undervaluing the offer to encourage play to continue. After several rounds of computing EVs and comparing offers, the EV of the game finally equals or surpasses the offer. (This occurs following round 6 in the game discussed here.) At this point, it is reasonable to accept the Banker’s “deal” and exit the game.

"My students have greatly enjoyed  exploring expected value through Deal or No Deal and have experienced  success in computing expected value and identifying its relationship to the offer as they track game play.

Many of my students challenge themselves to accurately calculate EV in their head as quickly as possible—with the hope of one day being selected as on-air contestants! When I had last done this activity with my class, Deal or No Deal had yet to produce a million-dollar winner. After all, if you are down to a $1 million case and a $100.00 case with an offer of $500,050.00, what would you do? In episodes at the end of season 3, show designers increased the number of $1 million cases (and as my student, Gina, noted, as many as eight), but there had been no  million-dollar winner. How do these additional $1 million cases impact the EV? Early in season 4, however, a contestant decided to forego an offer of more that $500,000.00 to take her initially chosen briefcase, and won the $1 million prize.",50,mtms2009-02-330a,,
