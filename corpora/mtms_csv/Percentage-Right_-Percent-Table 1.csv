20,Percentage Right_ Percentage Wrong - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"2. a. If Baldo got 75 percent correct, then he got 25 percent wrong (not 35 percent, as he stated). The cartoon may be humorous because he makes a mathematical error while talking about the math problems he missed.",,
21,Percentage Right_ Percentage Wrong - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"b. Sample solution: Baldo answered 0.75  20, or 15, problems correctly, meaning that he answered 20  15, or 5 problems incorrectly. Sample solution: If he answered 75 percent correctly, then he answered 25 percent incorrectly, meaning that he answered 0.25  20, or 5, problems incorrectly. Sample solution: Solving this proportion, where x = number of problems answered incorrectly, shows that 5 questions were answered incorrectly.",,

30,Percentage Right_ Percentage Wrong - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Sample solution: Each small square represents 1/25, or 4 percent, of the large square. Because 6 small squares are shaded, 6  4%, or 24 percent, of the large square is shaded.",,
31,Percentage Right_ Percentage Wrong - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"5. Baldo guessed 4 problems correctly. This problem involves finding a percentage of a percentage. Sample solution: The percentage that Baldo guessed correctly is 0.8  0.2 = 0.16, or 16 percent. The number of problems he guessed correctly is 0.16  25, or 4.",,
32,Percentage Right_ Percentage Wrong - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,CHALLENGE,,
33,Percentage Right_ Percentage Wrong - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"6. 76 percent. Sample solution: After the 60 percent markdown, the item costs only 40 percent of the original price. A 40 percent reduction on that 40 percent amount reduces the price by 0.40  0.40, or another 16 percent off the original price. This means the price of the item will be 40%  16%, or 24 percent, of the original price. Thus, the total percentage discount is 76 percent. (This is true regardless of the original price of the item.)",,

37,Percentage Right_ Percentage Wrong - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,FIELD-TEST COMMENTS,,
38,Percentage Right_ Percentage Wrong - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I used this cartoon with seventh-grade students after working on a unit with percentages, so this was a good review. Students worked individually and did not have access to calculators. After reading the cartoon, several students immediately raised their hands to ask if the 35 percent wrong in the cartoon was a typo. They did not understand at first that the error was part of the point of the cartoon. All students correctly answered questions 14, and all but one answered question 5 correctly. Some converted the percentages to decimals and multiplied; others set up ratios.",,
39,Percentage Right_ Percentage Wrong - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"All students attempted the challenge problems. Although every student answered question 7 correctly, they all missed question 6. Most added the 60 percent and 40 percent. We focused on this question the next day. I asked if a 100 percent discount was reasonable and explained that it would be the same as getting the item for free. Together we put in a value for a price and calculated the cost with a 60 percent discount, and then 40 percent off that price. Once they used numerical values, they understood how the math worked. Several found this very interesting since they like to shop.",,

43,Percentage Right_ Percentage Wrong - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"My sixth-grade prealgebra students enjoyed Baldos humorous application of percentages so much that they jokingly stated that he must have missed 7 problems to achieve 35 percent incorrect. This provided an inter-esting discussion since 7/22 is about 32 percent. Students creatively analyzed the problem, stating that the two extra problems that Baldo seemed to believe he had missed were extra credit. Since the whole test was based on 20 problems, the extra-credit problems were also worth 5 percent each. Some of the methods used to correctly solve the problem included calculating 75 percent of 20; 3/4 of 20; and 20/4 to find one-fourth of the problems.",,
44,Percentage Right_ Percentage Wrong - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Our favorite problem was number 6. Some students calculated the fractional discount 6/10  4/10 = 24/100 and then subtracted the 24 percent from 100 percent to arrive at the 76 percent discount. One student made a flow chart using $100 as a starting point.,,
45,Percentage Right_ Percentage Wrong - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"$100  60 percent is $60, so the item now costs $40.",,
46,Percentage Right_ Percentage Wrong - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"$40  40 percent is $16, so the item now costs $24.",,

51,Percentage Right_ Percentage Wrong - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"My seventh-grade prealgebra class was studying percentage applications when this activity was assigned. The students were able to easily complete questions 15, but they had trouble doing questions 6 and 7 because they had not seen this type of question. It was interesting to see their misconceptions. For example, many said that the discount would be 100 percent for question 6; for question 7a, many said the markup would be 50 percent.",,
52,Percentage Right_ Percentage Wrong - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I think it would be good to ask students to continue to represent the answers visually, as they were asked to do in questions 1b and 4. Perhaps question 2b could have a rectangle with 20 squares, and students could be asked to shade 75 percent to show 15 questions correct. Question 3 was a little harder. I showed my students a rectangle of 10 blocks and had them shade 4 to represent 40 percent. Then I increased the size of the rectangle to 20 blocks with 8 shaded, which again represented 40 percent, and then finally to 30 blocks with 12 shaded.",,

56,Percentage Right_ Percentage Wrong - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I gave this cartoon activity to my sixth-grade and seventh-grade classes. The sixth grade had just finished learning percentages, and the seventh grade was continuing to focus on applications of percentage, such as percentage increase and decrease. Both classes did well on most of the questions and used a variety of solution methods, such as proportions, ratio tables, and bar diagrams. Question 5s answer from students contained the most errors because many students simply did not read the question fully to understand that there was more than one part to consider.",,

62,Percentage Right_ Percentage Wrong - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,My eighth-grade algebra 1 part 1 class completed this activity on the first day of school following spring break. Students had previously worked with percentages as part of their writing and solving equations chapter. I had heard from one of their teachers that they often asked questions about calculating grades based on a point system. This activity provided an opportunity to address their questions while reviewing topics they would see on their exam.,,

65,Percentage Right_ Percentage Wrong - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"To help students with question 4, I referenced question 1. The students quickly realized that they were looking at one-fourth of 100, so they simply multiplied 6 by 4.
