"This book provides information on transforming instructional practices and is written primarily for administrators and teacher leaders (e.g., coaches and specialists). It describes how to encourage teachers to make instructional change and discusses different strategies that support such change.

Standards: Transforming Practice through Team Leadership serves as more of an overview of the process of transforming teaching practices rather than providing in-depth information about the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics. This book might be useful to administrators or mathematics teacher leaders who are looking for broad guidelines on how to encourage and support instructional change at their school.,10,mtms2013-04-515a,,

"The major strength  of the book is that the authors highlight  “Big Ideas, Essential Understandings, and Reflections” to provide key areas to focus on. This allows teachers the opportunity to address common concerns among students. Some will find the generous use of mathematics vocabulary to be a strength; however, this may be considered a weakness to middle-grades mathematics teachers who do not have a strong mathematics background.",16,mtms2013-04-515a,,
I strongly recommend this book for middle-grades mathematics educators either as a book study or as a professional development resource. I also recommend it for use in mathematics methods courses in teacher preparation at the college and university level.,17,mtms2013-04-515a,,

"Facilitators can prepare quickly for workshops by using the activity suggestions (such as the gallery walks) and the literature resources provided. When designing plans for leading professional development, Collins determined the most crucial information needed for educators to be successful and efficient users of classroom assessments. Because of this consideration, professional learning communities can rest assured that, no matter the time frame allotted, this guide will ensure that the most pertinent content is covered. ",24,mtms2013-04-515a,,
"The framework and principles of this book are well grounded and provide a multitude of resources that will be most useful to facilitators, teachers, and administrators. The workshop guides are simple and give ample instruction on the best methods for introducing the elements of assessment development and use in the classroom. In addition to PLCs, this book should be considered as a resource for university professors teaching assessment courses to students in education. ",25,mtms2013-04-515a,,
"One downfall of this book is that  although numerous references are made to many great resources, these resources must be on hand to make this an effective guide.

This book, applicable for any level of classroom, provides a persuasive argument for shifting to a formative assessment-centered classroom. ",31,mtms2013-04-515a,,
"The authors differentiate among three kinds of assessment: diagnostic (identifies preconceptions, misconceptions, and learning challenges), formative (directs instruction and gives students feedback on their understanding), and summative (measures growth or progress toward goals). They emphasize that when teachers use formative assessment classroom techniques (FACTs) to identify their students’ initial ideas, they have a point on which they can build and an awareness of areas in need of correction. ",32,mtms2013-04-515a,,
"The authors provide 75 FACTs that easily fit into classrooms with very little time expended and, for the most part, little to moderate preparation. Each activity is clearly explained, often with figures supporting the text. Mathematics Formative Assessment is a clearly organized resource. ",33,mtms2013-04-515a,,
"The only suggestion for improving  the book is if it listed more than one example for each activity. I would have liked a list of possible standards applications to accompany the activities.

"This book presents itself as “the self-teaching manual that makes learning Pre-Algebra E-Z.” The early content covers number sense topics such as properties, order of operations, fractions, decimals, and ratios and proportions. The latter part of the book includes geometry, functions, statistics, and probability. There are a total of eighteen chapters, each beginning with learning intentions, a list of vocabulary terms, and the sections covered. There is a brief introduction of each concept, and some practice problems are included at the end of every section. Each chapter concludes with a review. Solutions are provided for all the problems.

"The content is presented in a manner similar to a traditional textbook, focusing on standard algorithms. The text does not contain conceptual methods of teaching the content. Although the cover states that this book will prepare a student for a Common Core algebra class, there are no references to the Common Core within the text. ",41,mtms2013-04-515a,,
E-Z Pre-Algebra would be a good  resource for students who need a review of mathematical concepts that have already been taught. I used pages from the text with my students when we were working on the volume of several polyhedrons. The formulas were on a few pages that they used as a reference. I will make this resource available to the students in my classroom.  —Leslie K. Ercole,42,mtms2013-04-515a,,

"The introduction gives the reader a little history about the Pythagorean theorem. The authors show some preliminary constructions that are necessary for the proofs and demonstrations  found in the following chapters. The last chapter contains problems using the Pythagorean theorem that can be modeled with Sketchpad software.   This book would be a nice resource for teachers who would like to demonstrate different proofs for the Pythagorean theorem in class. Teachers can choose which proofs they use in class, and completion of one activity is not required to move to the next. ",48,mtms2013-04-515a,,
"The activities are designed under  the assumption that the reader is experienced with Sketchpad. However, some pages have small reminders in the margin that will help the inexperienced Sketchpad user. These activities help students visualize the theorem and provide insights that no picture can offer by constructing and dynamically manipulating figures. ",49,mtms2013-04-515a,,
This book would be appropriate for  advanced students in grades 6–8 who  are already familiar with Sketchpad; it will also add enrichment and challenge to the students’ understanding of the Pythagorean theorem.,50,mtms2013-04-515a,,
