"A Yin and Yang Approach to Area and Irregular Shapes tThe Measurement Standard for  grades 6–8 in  NCTM’s Principles and Standards for School Mathematics (2000) emphasizes that students should develop formulas to find the areas of triangles, parallelograms, and trapezoids and develop strategies to find the areas of more complex shapes. “Developing formulas” often involves doubling or cutting and translating pieces of basic shapes, such as triangles, parallelograms, and trapezoids. Strategies for working with more complex shapes often include partitioning them into triangles, rectangles, or parallelograms. The yin and yang activity offers an irregular shape to investigate and extends and reinforces these strategies. Behind the name and the objects in the activity is the yin and yang story, which gives students the opportunity to reflect on different cultures and may help them remember the doubling strategy for finding area. This activity has been successfully implemented with students in China by Zhou Jinyan and with students in the United States by David Yopp. ",2,mtms2007-12-296a,,

"According to the philosopher Zhu Xi (1130–1200) of the Southern Song Dynasty, yin (feminine, negative) and yang (masculine, positive), the two fishes, come together to form the Ultimate, the way of all things in heaven and earth. The Ultimate can still be found in Chinese temples today.",4,mtms2007-12-296a,,
"The activity seems to work best when students are placed in groups of three to five and are given one of the pieces (either a yin or a yang), which we will call a “fish,” and a ruler and a pair of scissors. To encourage students to develop strategies, we suggest giving them no prior instruction and instead giving them only the objective: Find the area of the region. Let within-group and within-class dialogue take care of the rest.",5,mtms2007-12-296a,,

This approach is consistent with students’ prior knowledge of how a triangle can be doubled to form a parallelogram, which is used to motivate students to discover the triangle-area formula: = 1 bh",11,mtms2007-12-296a,,
"Figure 2 illustrates a cuttingand-translating approach that is comparable to cutting a triangle from a parallelogram, translating it, and reattaching it to form a rectangle. Figure 3 illustrates a third, more novel strategy that is actually very similar to strategy 2. The fish has been folded to form a quarter circle that is covered front and back. The areas of the front  and back quarter circles sum to the area of a half circle.",12,mtms2007-12-296a,,
"At the end of the activity, it is important to discuss the students’ various strategies and compare them with strategies used previously on more familiar shapes. To promote students’ flexible thinking, discuss how these strategies can be generalized to other cases. The yin and yang activity offers students the opportunity to see how more than one strategy can achieve the same outcome.",13,mtms2007-12-296a,,
