"As a teacher, how do you respond? (Both yes and no are unwise.) It would be preferable if the student knew strategies for determining whether 12/17 was a reasonable sum. Such strategies should be explored so that students will know the outcome of adding numerators and denominators to fi nd the sum of two fractions. Estimation would be a useful tool for exploring this sixth grader’s question.",5,mtms2011-09-96a,,
"In classrooms where students work on developing both traditional and invented algorithms, estimation should play an important role. Students  should develop and use strategies for estimating the results of computations and should judge the reasonableness of results (NCTM 2000). When designing activities about fraction operations, Van de Walle, Karp, and Bay-Williams (2010) suggest that instruction should initially involve simple, contextual tasks, which give students opportunities to use models and diagrams and to make connections between the meaning of wholenumber operations and the meaning of fraction operations. These researchers also note that estimation should  play an important role in the development of both formal and informal strategies. Explored here will be the ways that estimation is used when students are learning to add, subtract, multiply, and divide fractions.  deVeloPing nUMBeR sense and BenchMaRKs",6,mtms2011-09-96a,,

"For students to realize when fractions should be added, subtracted, multiplied, or divided, they need to develop a sense of size for various fraction quantities. They also need number sense, which will enable them to use estimation as a tool with fractions. When wrestling with quantities like three-fifths or nine-tenths, as individual fractions and in relation to each other, students will develop a sense of size and quantity for individual fractions. This experience is necessary if students are to develop meaning for fraction operations.",13,mtms2011-09-96a,,
"The ability to compare fractions using benchmarks will support the skill of finding reasonable estimates when adding and subtracting fractions. Understanding what is implied  by “3/4 of something” or “1 2/3 of something” is necessary when making sense of situations that require fraction multiplication. Typical situational contexts for division can lead to finding how many of one quantity is in another quantity. When dividing 9/10 by 2/5, it is important to understand two-fifths as a quantity and how it compares with nine-tenths. If students are able to compare these two quantities, they can potentially estimate how many two-fifths can reasonably go into nine-tenths.",14,mtms2011-09-96a,,
"Activities with concrete models can help students develop an understanding of the relative sizes of fractions. Fraction strips are one such model. Students can both visualize as well as describe strategies for folding inch-wide strips  of paper into halves, thirds, fourths, and fifths. For example, when folding a paper strip into eighths and comparing it with the strip for halves, students can see that 1/8 as a quantity is relatively small and significantly less than 1/2.",15,mtms2011-09-96a,,
"Varying approaches will allow  students to connect 1/4 of 1/2 to the quantity 1/8. First, students can fold a paper strip in half. Then, by folding the doubled-over strip into four parts, they can see that the unfolded strip is subdivided into eighths. A second strategy for making eighths is to fold the full strip into fourths and then in half to create eight equal sections in the whole. These experiences will allow students to see what 1/8 is in relation to 1 whole as well as 1/4 and 1/2. Folding paper strips into fractions  will further students’ partitioning and subpartitioning reasoning and will support their ability to meaningfully order and compare fractions.",16,mtms2011-09-96a,,
"A second activity that helps students develop fraction number sense involves drawing a large number line on the board with markings at 0, 1/2, and 1. Students can be given sticky notes with various fractions, then asked to go to the board and estimate where to place the fraction on the number line and explain their reasoning. Table 1 provides fractions, their estimated placement on the number line, and important reasoning. The development of fraction  number sense is fundamental to the development of fraction operation sense. Experiences such as these engage students in thinking about fractions as quantities and their relationship to one another and to 1 whole. This type of reasoning is important for helping ",17,mtms2011-09-96a,,
"The development  of fraction  number sense is fundamental  to the development  of fraction  operation sense.  students use benchmarks such as  0, 1/2, or 1 to estimate the reasonableness of a sum, difference, product, or quotient. Reinforcing a visual image and understanding that fractions can represent quantities on a number line are necessary attributes when trying to decide if 6/7 + 6/10 = 17/12.  sUPPoRting FRaction oPeRation sense",18,mtms2011-09-96a,,
"Number sense “does not develop by chance, nor does being skilled at manipulating numbers necessarily reflect this acquaintance and familiarity with numbers” (Reys 1994, p. 114). Using visual models such as fraction strips and number lines support students’ ability to visualize fractions and develop a sense of relative size. However, visual models are not enough. During instruction, students should routinely be asked to use their understanding of relative size to make sense of situations in which fractions are used operationally. Reys (1994) suggests that certain types of questions lead students to use natural language to articulate reasoning about how quantities are related. These questions will also help students reflect on the effect that different operations have on numbers. ",19,mtms2011-09-96a,,

Each problem in figure 1 asks  students to explain their reasoning and describe what will happen without actually calculating an answer. Students are encouraged to use fraction number sense and the meaning of an operation to make sense of the computational situations (Reys 1994). Such exercises on learning to compute with fractions give students more opportunities to build number sense and support understanding of the meaning of operations. ,30,mtms2011-09-96a,,
"Students who do not know procedures or who have not developed computational algorithms can engage in this type of reasoning. Providing simple contextual problems that require estimation and that can be solved using models or diagrams will encourage the use of number sense when operating with fractions (Cramer et al. 2010; Van de Walle, Karp, and BayWilliams 2010). Consider the following directions and problem: ",31,mtms2011-09-96a,,
"The directions ask students to use  number sense and operations. Although some students may struggle initially, most can draw on their experience with whole-number operations to determine that this task involves subtraction. As students share their reasoning and listen to their classmates’ discussion, their ability to determine which operation is implied, to model a situation, and to estimate a reasonable solution will improve. The more opportunities that students have to solve and discuss approaches, the better. Developing connections among a problem’s context, a model or diagram, and estimation are important so that students can develop their own procedures and make sense of commonly used procedures for fraction operations.

"When posing problems such as these, schedule a whole-class discussion in which students can share their solutions and reasoning. Students should be encouraged to explain their thinking frequently, because sharing estimation strategies allows students access to others’ thinking (NCTM 2000). Students’ ability to identify what operation is appropriate, estimate a reasonable solution, and find an exact solution will improve by considering the approaches of their peers.",37,mtms2011-09-96a,,
"Students need to be routinely  encouraged to reflect on the size of an anticipated solution. For students to estimate solutions reasonably, they need to be able to visualize the quantities and understand how quantities are acted on operationally.
