I gave examples such as “text,” text me the pages in the text we are supposed to read, and “pear,” I ate a pair of pears. I had known that language was an issue for my students in mathematics.

8,Routinizing Mathematics Vocabulary: The Vocab Grid,"As educators, we do not always consider mathematics a foreign language to students, but it is often the second (or third or fourth) language that they are learning to read and speak (Barrow 2014; Dunston and Tyminski 2013; Hughes, Powell, and Stevens 2016). But in this moment, I had an aha! moment about how to attack the vocabulary problem through instruction. My students needed to talk about language in math class. We needed a routine that acknowledged the complexity of learning the language of mathematics and supported students in developing fluency in that language (Dunston and Tyminski 2013). That week, I changed my approach to vocabulary in the mathematics classroom. ",8,Routinizing Mathematics Vocabulary: The Vocab Grid

10,Routinizing Mathematics Vocabulary: The Vocab Grid,"There is evidence that mathematical language is particularly difficult for English Language Learners (ELLs) (Barrow 2014; Roberts and Truxaw 2013); however, with all my students, I observed struggles with language that mirrored the challenges that ELLs often have with math vocabulary. The students in my sixth-grade math class were a diverse group of  learners in an urban, full-inclusion setting. The group included both native English speakers as well as ELLs. My students struggled with the vocabulary because of the technical language of the subject area; multiple representations of a single concept; terms with multiple meanings; terms with other meanings in colloquial English; confusion caused by homonyms, homophones, and words that sound similar; and for emergent multilingual students, similarity to native language words that could cause confusion (Roberts and Truxaw 2013). ",10,Routinizing Mathematics Vocabulary: The Vocab Grid
11,Routinizing Mathematics Vocabulary: The Vocab Grid,"What is particularly confusing  about mathematics vocabulary  in the English language is the  number of homonyms: words that have one meaning in colloquial  conversation that may or may not have a completely different meaning in a mathematical context (Barrow 2014). Take, for example, the word product. According to the MerriamWebster Dictionary (2016), this  word has multiple meanings in  our everyday life:  1.  (a) Something produced, (b) something resulting from or necessarily following from a set of conditions.  2.  The amount, quantity, or total  produced.  3.  The number or expression resulting from the multiplication together of two or more numbers or expressions. ",11,Routinizing Mathematics Vocabulary: The Vocab Grid

21,Routinizing Mathematics Vocabulary: The Vocab Grid,"To better assist my students, I developed a routine for introducing and teaching vocabulary that built on what students already knew about language and focused on contextualizing language in mathematics. The result was a routine based on the Vocabulary Grid, a template I created (see fig. 1). The vocabulary grid had six columns: the rating, the word, the definition, synonym(s), an example, and a sample problem. Each of these columns had a particular role in the development of fluency in the  language of mathematics. (See fig. 2 for a student work sample of this grid in action.)",21,Routinizing Mathematics Vocabulary: The Vocab Grid
22,Routinizing Mathematics Vocabulary: The Vocab Grid,Developing Vocabulary Lists,22,Routinizing Mathematics Vocabulary: The Vocab Grid
23,Routinizing Mathematics Vocabulary: The Vocab Grid,"This routine focused on a list of terms I generated that included a preview of language needed for upcoming content, a review of language that had been originally taught in prior grade levels, and terms that students demonstrated confusion with from prior weeks. The list was intended to develop fluency in the language of mathematics and not just to address key terms in the current unit or study (Dunston and Tyminski 2013). For example, one week the list included these words: expression, equation, equivalent, variable, factor, multiple, product, quotient, dividend,  divisor. This list reflected the current unit (expression, equation, equivalent, variable), as well as a review  of words students should know (factor, multiple, product, quotient, dividend, divisor). ",23,Routinizing Mathematics Vocabulary: The Vocab Grid
24,Routinizing Mathematics Vocabulary: The Vocab Grid,"Building on Prior Knowledge The routine began with the words, usually a list of 5-10 per week, and a focus on what students already knew or did not know about the words on the list. I wrote the words on the board and read them aloud to students. As students were introduced to the list, they were asked to rate each word according to their personal knowledge of this word in a mathematical context or otherwise. The rating of the words was the crux of the routine. Here, we focused ",24,Routinizing Mathematics Vocabulary: The Vocab Grid

29,Routinizing Mathematics Vocabulary: The Vocab Grid,"As a whole group, students shared their ratings for each word. When students rated the word a 3 (I have never seen or heard this word before), I elicited guesses from students about the word and its meaning based on its similarity to other known words. ",29,Routinizing Mathematics Vocabulary: The Vocab Grid
30,Routinizing Mathematics Vocabulary: The Vocab Grid,"When students rated the word a 2 (I have seen or heard this word before), we discussed where the word had been seen or heard. This often brought up instances in which (1) the word was being confused for another similar word in spelling or pronunciation (e.g., sum confused for sun), or (2) alternate defi nitions of the word were known to students, but the mathematical defi nition was unfamiliar. For example, when asked where students had seen or heard the word “face,” a student replied, “I have eyes on my face.” This sparked a discussion about how many words have meanings outside the mathematical context, and that these meanings can sometimes lead us to an understanding of the mathematical defi nition. Often, the mathematical defi nition was generated from these discussions. When students gave a 1 rating (I know this word, and I can defi ne it), they were asked to provide their defi nition, and the class discussed its validity. This simple act of rating a list of words led to rich discussion and enhanced students’ fl uency in the language of mathematics. ",30,Routinizing Mathematics Vocabulary: The Vocab Grid

32,Routinizing Mathematics Vocabulary: The Vocab Grid,"After defi ning the word, students then generated a list of mathematical synonyms for the word that might also be used in that word’s place in a problem or other mathematical context. For example, when discussing the word “product,” students listed words like “answer” or “total” as synonyms. This important part of the routine helped students to make connections between known words and begin to see patterns in how language is used  in mathematics. It also began to train students to read in mathematics the way they read in other subjects, looking for meaning in the text instead of hunting and pecking for quantities and “key words,” which often led them astray in problem-solving situations. As students grew more fl uent in the language of mathematics, they were better able to approach problems as “problem solvers” rather than “problem performers” (Rigelman 2007).

This example might be a visual representation of the word, such as a drawing, model, or diagram. These examples were important to the routine. Throughout the week, I highlighted and intentionally provided additional examples of the words in my instruction.

36,Routinizing Mathematics Vocabulary: The Vocab Grid,"A quiz at the end of each week required students to match words to their defi nitions (for only a few points of credit), but more important, it required students to apply their vocabulary knowledge to problems and solve problems necessitating an understanding of the week’s word list. This gave students an opportunity to demonstrate their ability to apply their knowledge of the words in context. Beyond the weekly quiz, students were encouraged to acknowledge prior vocabulary words in contexts throughout the year. I required students to keep each week’s Vocab Grid and build a math dictionary in their notebook. As we encountered words, I asked them to review their prior lists to identify words we had previously studied and encourage them to use what they knew to think about a new word in context.",36,Routinizing Mathematics Vocabulary: The Vocab Grid
37,Routinizing Mathematics Vocabulary: The Vocab Grid,REFLECTIONS,37,Routinizing Mathematics Vocabulary: The Vocab Grid
38,Routinizing Mathematics Vocabulary: The Vocab Grid,"The students became more fl uent in the mathematical defi nitions of the vocabulary that they were encountering in tasks posed in class, on benchmark assessments and standardized tests, and in the world around them. They developed not only an ability to stop and refl ect on a word and whether or not they knew what it meant but also a bigger repository of mathematical vocabulary. This, in turn, helped them be more successful in problem solving. In addition, the preview-and-review structure of the routine gave me an opportunity to engage students in problem-solving tasks about a wide variety of content, spiraling back to units previously covered and looking ahead to future content. This is useful in helping students to retain and review skills and push themselves to think about  new concepts. By starting our vocabulary instruction with a focus on what students already knew, we were able to make ties to their prior knowledge and establish lasting connections. The routine developed not only vocabulary skills but also the students’ ability and willingness to consider and evaluate new words in mathematical contexts and increased their fl uency in the language of mathematics.
