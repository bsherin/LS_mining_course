Some Thoughts  about Fractions,1,mtms2007-03-370a,,
"T HE  wrITING  Of  “THE  fuTurE  Of  frAC- tions” in 1978 was motivated by a single incident, the quote that begins the article. That quote—indicating  that  fractions  would  become obsolete—is from an editorial essay in the Virginia Mathematics Teacher by Lucien Hall. Hall was an active, responsible, and knowledgeable member of the mathematics education community, and when I saw what he had written, I knew that his statement represented the beliefs of many other mathematics teachers and educators. I felt that his statement and this broader view of the impending demise of fractions had to be addressed.",2,mtms2007-03-370a,,
"Twenty-eight  years  later,  the  situation  regarding fractions is quite different. The realization that fractions represent division and constitute the most common way in which division is represented in algebra has caused a demand for increasing competence with fractions by all those for whom algebra skills are important. How can a person operate with algebraic fractions without the ability to do arithmetic fractions? If algebra is to be “for all,” then every student needs to have competence with fractions. ",3,mtms2007-03-370a,,
"How  much  competence  a  student  needs  with paper-and-pencil  computation  is  a  subject  of  great debate,  but  I  think  almost  everyone  agrees  that ",4,mtms2007-03-370a,,
"ZALMAN uSISKIN, z-usiskin@uchicago.edu, is a professor of education at the University of Chicago and director of the University of Chicago School Mathematics Project. He has taught junior high school and senior high school mathematics and has authored or coauthored over 150 articles and textbooks  for  all  the  grades  6–12.  He  received  a  Lifetime Achievement Award from NCTM in 2001.",5,mtms2007-03-370a,,
students should have certain understandings about fractions without needing to use technology:  1.  finding fractions equivalent to a given fraction 2.  Converting  certain  fractions  to  decimals  and  3.  Knowing when fractions are near integers or oth- percents  er benchmarks  numbers  4.  Converting  simple  improper  fractions  to  mixed  5.  Adding and subtracting simple fractions with the  same denominator  6.  Multiplying fractions 7.  Graphing simple fractions on a number line 8.  recognizing situations that lead to the four fundamental operations with fractions 9.  writing proportions when the situation calls for  them,6,mtms2007-03-370a,,
"Some people have the same view of division of fractions that Lucien Hall had of fractions themselves, but I would add that students need to know how to divide fractions.",7,mtms2007-03-370a,,
"How Bad Is the Current Situation? wHEN wE ASK HOw bAD IS THE frACTION SITuation in the united States, we look at those things that  almost  everyone  would  feel  students  should be able to do. Performance on the single problem  “1 3/4 ÷ 1/2” is perhaps the most commonly given example of evidence of the horrible state of fraction knowledge in the united States. ",8,mtms2007-03-370a,,
"The problem was first given by ball to 217 preservice  elementary  and  35  preservice  secondary school  teachers  at  Dartmouth,  Michigan  State,  ",9,mtms2007-03-370a,,
"Illinois State, florida, and Norfolk State. These college  students  were  asked  to  compute  the  answer and  then  “come  up  with  pictures,  models,  stories, or real world representations” for the problem. ball (1990) reported that “virtually all of the teacher candidates were able to calculate 1 3/4 ÷ 1/2 during the interviews.” but “very few of the secondary preservice teachers and none of the preservice elementary school teachers were able to generate a mathematically appropriate representation of the division.” (In English, the phrases “split something in 2” and “split something  in  half”  mean  the  same  thing.  I  doubt that the phrases have the same meaning in Chinese, and I wonder whether the numbers in this question are of greater difficulty to speakers of English than Chinese and whether one would get the same result if the problem had been 1 3/4 ÷ 2/3.) when the problem was given by Ma in her doctoral dissertation study to 21 American elementary school teachers,  only  9  answered  it  correctly,  whereas  all 72 Chinese teachers (from the Shanghai prefecture) answered  it  correctly.  ralston  (2001)  calls  this  the “single most startling finding” in the book (Ma 1999) that she wrote closely following her dissertation.  because of results like these, fractions have become the rallying cry of many who have written against the NCTM Standards and more progressive curricula.

How Bad Was the Situation when  “The Future of Fractions” Was Written?,11,mtms2007-03-370a,,
"IT IS INTErESTING THAT A SINGLE PrObLEM ALSO captured the fancy of critics of existing mathematics education about the time “The future of fractions” appeared. The following item, given to thirteen-yearolds, appeared in the 1978 National Assessment of Educational Progress (Post 1981):",12,mtms2007-03-370a,,

"The  choices  given—and  percents  responding— were 1 (7%), 2 (24%), 19 (28%), 21 (27%), and “I don’t know” (14%), indicating that students answered this question  randomly.  behr  and  Post  (1988)  felt  that errors like these are common problems of rational number  learning:  children’s  use  of  incorrect  rote algorithms;  their  failure  to  think  of  a  symbol  like “12/13”  as  representing  one  number;  and,  more generally,  their  shaky  understanding  of  rational number size and order concepts.   4 3      ",16,mtms2007-03-370a,,
"In 1978, the predominant attitude in elementary school mathematics was to drill on skills; it was the height  of  the  back-to-basics  era.  Performance  on problems like these is what led mathematics educators to want to emphasize problem solving and context rather than rote manipulation.",17,mtms2007-03-370a,,
"Thus, poor performance on fractions has been used in different eras both to argue for and against more emphasis on paper-and-pencil computational skills.",18,mtms2007-03-370a,,
Have Fractions Been Ignored?,19,mtms2007-03-370a,,
"THE VOLuME AddiNg iT UP: HeLPiNg CHiLdreN Learn  Mathematics  (Kilpatrick,  Swafford,  and  findell 2001) contains a long treatise on how teachers should  teach  fractions,  written  as  if  teachers  have never been schooled in the teaching of fractions. Yet every one of the mathematics texts on my shelves for elementary school teachers contains significant material on fractions, and every one of my mathematics methods books for elementary school teachers also discusses fractions in detail. The amount of attention given to fractions is independent of the decade in which the books were written and shows us that the teaching and learning of fractions has been a problem for a long time.",20,mtms2007-03-370a,,
"And despite Lucien Hall’s prediction that fractions would  become  obsolete,  competence  with  fraction operations has been on every list of state standards I have ever seen. And fractions are in all elementary school  series,  whether  traditional  or  progressive. furthermore, there may be more attention to proportional reasoning today than ever before.",21,mtms2007-03-370a,,
How Can We Explain Such a Seemingly Poor Performance?,22,mtms2007-03-370a,,
"HOw  CAN  THErE  bE  SuCH  DISCrEPANCIES,  NOT only  between  Chinese  teachers  and  u.S.  teachers but also between the results of computation in ball’s sample and Ma’s sample? One reason is that neither of these studies would get to first base in the current climate of being “scientifically based research.” The samples are not representative from either country and are not from the intended student population to which  the  results  are  often  extrapolated.  furthermore, the content is on the cusp of what is agreed on as being important content for students to learn about fractions. ",23,mtms2007-03-370a,,
"Other reasons are due to the different characters of our educational systems. As ralston notes, Chinese  elementary  school  teachers  do  not  teach  all subjects as our teachers do; most teach only mathematics. Additionally, I have been told that until recently in China, there was great competition among young women to become teachers, and the Chinese ",24,mtms2007-03-370a,,
"VOL. 12, NO. 7  .  MArCH 2007   371 teachers in Ma’s sample were likely in the top few percent  of  their  classes  when  they  were  students. The importance of these attributes also explains why the prospective teachers in ball’s sample performed like  the  Chinese  teachers,  at  least  in  computation: ball’s sample was primarily from more selective universities. These results thus suggest that if we want to have knowledgeable mathematics teachers in our elementary  schools,  we  need  to  either  (1)  attract the best students to become teachers or (2) put the teaching of mathematics in our elementary schools in the hands of specialist teachers. Indeed, it is possible that if we did (2), we might be likely to get (1).",25,mtms2007-03-370a,,
"How Do We Cope with a Difficult Topic? wE HAVE VArIOuS wAYS Of COPING wITH A TOPIC such as fractions that presents difficulty.  1.  Make  the  topic  more  important.  Spend  more time on it, and expect more. This approach suggests that the reason for poor student performance is the lack  of  time  spent  on  the  topic.  It  is  the  approach taken in the California Mathematics framework, adopted in 2005 (California Department of Education 2006).  Among  the  expectations  in  that  framework are that seventh-grade students should be able to answer questions such as these (pp. 27, 29): 12 13",26,mtms2007-03-370a,,

"Multiply, divide, and simplify rational numbers by using exponent rules:      4 3    4 3  2. Make the topic less important. work around it as much as possible. This essentially is the approach suggested by Lucien Hall. Change fractions to decimals, and work with them. why do something that is difficult if we have an easier way? It is a reasonable approach in arithmetic but does not work in algebra, since algebraic fractions with variables in the denominator cannot be changed to decimals. At some point, a student needs to be able to operate with fractions in algebra.",28,mtms2007-03-370a,,
"3.  delay  the  teaching  of  the  topic.  This  approach was taken in france. Much more geometry is taught to younger students, whereas fractions are delayed until  grades  8  or  9.  The  justification  for  delay  may be found by viewing the understanding of fractions as requiring that a person be “formal-operational,” in the language of Piaget. Although delaying topics was popular in the 1970s and into the 1980s, this method has lost adherents in the united States because many topics are presented later here than in many other countries.  4. Use technology to perform the operations. In 1978, calculators that performed fraction operations were not  widely  used.  However,  they  currently  contain this capability and are widely used, so this approach has gained popularity. One justification is why spend valuable classroom time working on a paper-and-pencil skill when a calculator can complete the process quickly  and  accurately?  (It  seems  likely  that  one reason for the complexity of the items shown from the California Mathematics framework is to exhibit problems that would be difficult to do with a calculator and thus justify the proscription of calculators at this level.) 5. Change the approach significantly, either mathematically  or  pedagogically. Of all the strategies for change, this one occurs most often with difficult topics and is the most complex. My view is that we make two fundamental errors in teaching fractions. first, the models for operations that are commonly taught (e.g., the measurement and partition models in division) are quite appropriate for whole numbers but often fail for fractions. we need to stress models (such as rate and ratio for division) that easily extend from whole  numbers  to  fractions.  for  instance,  to  find the average speed if we have traveled 100 miles in 2 hours, we divide 100 miles by 2 hours; similarly, to find the average speed if we have walked 1 3/4 miles in 1/2 hour, we divide 1 3/4 by 1/2. Second, we need to consider fractions as being single numbers far earlier than we do. Levin (1998) found that traditional elementary  mathematics  textbook  series  explore fractions  as  being  pairs  of  numbers  (showing  ratio representations and focusing on the numerator and the denominator in the development of algorithms) about four years before fractions are treated as single numbers (stressing the meaning of the fraction bar as a division symbol, the “value” of the fraction as a decimal, and the representation as a point on a number line).",29,mtms2007-03-370a,,
"These choices of strategies are not limited to fractions.  They  can  be  found  in  the  teaching  of  word problems, of proof, and of manipulation with rational  expressions—three topics that are very difficult for high school students.",30,mtms2007-03-370a,,
"One thing seems clear for the future of fractions. They  will  remain  important  in  school  mathematics. It is even possible that, despite the existence of technology  that  can  deal  with  both  arithmetic  and algebraic fractions, fractions will be used as a bellwether for achievement in school mathematics for some time to come.",31,mtms2007-03-370a,,
