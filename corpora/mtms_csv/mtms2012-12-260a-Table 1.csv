"It is always hard to do justice to the worth of published articles—and to an author’s courage in so publicly presenting his or her thinking—and to push back on aspects of an article that one considers not quite right. I wish to do that here, however, with “Proportioning Cats and Rats” from the May 2012 issue (pp. 538–43). The article articulates well the value of using real-world-situated problem solving to develop students’ abilities to confidently and skillfully engage in reasoning proportionally. My own experience at both the middle school and high school levels convinced me early on that students gain deeper conceptual understanding and are eager, more satisfied learners when the more formal analysis of mathematical structure arises from, rather than precedes, contextualized problem solving. Although the article offers much valuable insight into the kind of curriculum experience and pedagogical approach that most benefits learners, I believe that several ideas in the article should be questioned.",9,mtms2012-12-260a,,
"The first is the idea that students should be encouraged to think of cats as working together mechanistically as a “team” to catch rats. The author writes, “With the Hens and Eggs problem, there is no possibility of ",10,mtms2012-12-260a,,
"Readers are encouraged to share their thoughts. E-mail letters to the journal at mtms@nctm.org, type Readers Write in the subject line, and copy the letter to all authors if responding to an article.",11,mtms2012-12-260a,,
"teamwork. . . . What if, instead of the cats working individually, they worked as a team?” (p. 542). This mechanistic “team” perspective is both mathematically unnecessary and contextually disingenuous. A quick search of the Internet will offer clear evidence to the fact that domesticated cats, unlike lions or wolves, do not work as a team when catching prey and in fact are solitary hunters. Putting it directly, it is simply bad pedagogy to implicitly suggest to students that the way to avoid “problematic” fractions in a real-world problem is to pretend that the problem’s context is completely different than it really is. ",12,mtms2012-12-260a,,
"The second misconception that the  author promotes is evidenced by this statement: “Their entry in the third row, 8 1/3 rats [in reference to a cat killing 8 1/3 rats in 50 minutes], was incompatible with the context of the problem” (p. 542). Although in a subsequent sentence, the author is correct in saying that a cat cannot kill 1/3 of a rat, she overlooks the reality that rates in naturalistic settings are often average rates. A real cat, hunting rats in a building suitably dense with rodents to support an average killing rate of 1 rat killed every 6 minutes, would not kill rats at exactly 6-minute intervals as  if the cat was a programmable machine in a factory. The cat might  take 4.4 minutes to kill its first rat,  8 minutes for its second rat, 5.6 min- utes for its third rat, and so on. Neither cats nor rats—nor hens for that matter—are mechanistic precise machines. What would be assumed true is that the long-term average rate over  all cats would be 1 rat killed every  6 minutes, equivalent to an average rate of 8 1/3 rats per cat per 50-minute period. What this would mean realistically is that after 50 minutes some cats would probably have killed fewer than 8 rats, some perhaps exactly 8 rats, and some more than 8 rats, with the underlying distribution of number of rats killed in 50 minutes by individual cats having a mean of 8 1/3. Nothing about this fractional rate is incompatible with this naturalistic context, and a student’s puzzlement over such a rate presents a wonderfully rich teaching opportunity. ",13,mtms2012-12-260a,,
"In conclusion, teachers have   choices regarding ways to promote student understanding of proportional reasoning. If a teacher does not want to straightforwardly and honestly address fractional rate and contextual transformation validity issues with his or her particular class, then problems should be posed for which fractional rates and contextual transformation validity are not issues.",14,mtms2012-12-260a,,

"Markworth responds: Thank you for pushing some ideas in my article. I have always believed that different lenses are beneficial, and your lens, specifically focusing on the context of the problem, is an important one. ",18,mtms2012-12-260a,,
"I believe that both of your points   illustrate the balancing act that all teachers face between providing a completely authentic context and providing a context that is accessible and  meaningful to their students. Although house cats may not hunt in teams, students can easily imagine how this might work. Sometimes putting too much emphasis on authenticity (particularly when it is not mathematically relevant) may actually make the mathematics inaccessible to students. So, although there may be another context that is more accurate, this is a context that students can access, and which does not inhibit the mathematics.",19,mtms2012-12-260a,,
"I was actually quite impressed  with my students who questioned the incongruity of killing 1/3 of a rat. To me, this statement demonstrated their ability to contextualize, one aspect of the second mathematical practice of the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics. Some students chose to plow through this incongruity, hoping for (and getting) a wholenumber answer. Others chose to try a different strategy. Jilian, for one, decided that more cats were needed, again firmly thinking about the context of the problem.",20,mtms2012-12-260a,,
"I increasingly appreciate my question regarding milliners for its flexibility: If a dozen milliners can make a dozen hats in a dozen days, how long will it take 100 milliners to make  100 hats? Milliners can work as a team, and hats can certainly be partially finished. Unfortunately, with the Royal Wedding an event of the past, this context has become less meaningful.",21,mtms2012-12-260a,,

"Thank you, Jane Keiser, for your On My Mind article in MTMS (see  “Computational Fluency at What Price?” in the September 2012 issue, pp. 69–71). It would be interesting to see how many of the people who agree with you are teacher educators and how many are currently teaching children. My PPTs (personal practical theories) changed significantly after I moved from teaching high school to teaching teacher candidates. For example, I mindlessly taught invert and multiply until I started asking teacher candidates to explain this stupid shortcut. In fourteen years at the university level, not one candidate has been able to even make a start. Most just tell me what their teachers told them, “Yours is not to wonder why. . . .” ",23,mtms2012-12-260a,,

"Lamar University marye.wilkinson@lamar.edu in deFense oF  standaRd algoRithMs I feel that the standard method of division should be taught. I have worked with several students who use other methods and are happy to switch to the standard method. Some of the benefits are that they can use their estimating skills to approximate a single digit in the quotient. Then one follows a regular series of steps to solve the problem. This summer, I was working with a student who had to divide 17 into 4372. She was trying to figure out how many 17s were in 4000. She had just completed fourth grade, and this was a struggle. I asked her how many 17s were in 43 and she said 2. She wrote that number above the 3, multiplied, subtracted, and  brought down. The process continued until she found the answer. She continued to use that method on other problems.",25,mtms2012-12-260a,,
"As for long division becoming  bogged down, it happens. It is easy to play games with division, however. In the first few days of school, I develop patterns in the quotient, such as 123, 456, or 876. The students enjoy learning these patterns and know immediately if they are correct. That is good. Then we delve into patterns in the remainders, such as that the first problem has a remainder of 1, the next 2, and so on. Once again, students get instant feedback. Later, I use their birthdays for answers. If a student was born on September 10, 1999, the answer is 910 r 99. This is always a good activity to ask a quiet student to complete if you wish to get feedback. After several days, however, most students have divided their birthday.",26,mtms2012-12-260a,,
"Another practice activity should be dividing by a power of 10. As for doing a problem in one’s head, that is good, but students are much more successful when they write down what is in their heads. They can see it on paper. Students usually work better and more successfully when they follow the method instead of figuring it out. Also, as time goes on and they need to solve equations, writing down the steps is faster and more accurate. I always cringe when a student does 2x = 4 easily but does not know how to do 2.5x = 4. The method is more important than the answer.",27,mtms2012-12-260a,,
