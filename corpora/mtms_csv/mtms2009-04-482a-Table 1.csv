"Amy B. Ellis on quantities are important aspects of algebraic reasoning. This article describes two different approaches to teaching and learning linear functions for middle school students. One group focused on patterns in number tables, and the other group worked primarily with real-world quantities. This article highlights the different learning dynamics, reasoning activities, and student ideas that can emerge in classrooms that take a number-pattern approach or a quantitative reasoning approach to linear functions.",2,mtms2009-04-482a,,
What is Reasoning  With Quantities?,3,mtms2009-04-482a,,
"A classroom teacher asked one student, Sarah, to determine how fast  her classmate, Julio, walked. Sarah timed Julio with a stopwatch as he walked at a steady pace. She found that he had walked for 6 seconds and had traveled 15 feet. Sarah knew that one way to measure speed was to measure how far Julio walked in a given amount of time, so she decided that 15 feet in 6 seconds was a good measure of his speed. Another classmate, Ben, said that walking 15 feet in 6 seconds would be the same speed as walking 5 feet in 2 seconds, because you could divide both the feet and the seconds by 3. Julio argued that it would also be the same speed as 2.5 feet in 1 second, because you could just divide both by 6. The students decided that all of these measures described Julio’s speed.",4,mtms2009-04-482a,,

"Sarah’s measures of distance (15  feet) and time (6 seconds) are examples of quantities. A quantity is the measure of some quality, such as distance or time. The quantity consists of the quality (distance), the appropriate unit of measure (feet), and a numerical value (15 feet). When Sarah and her classmates thought about speed  as a ratio of feet to seconds, they were reasoning with quantities and their relationships; this type of reasoning is characterized as quantitative reasoning. One way to promote algebraic generalizations is to encourage students to engage in quantitative reasoning (Steffe and Izsak 2002; Thompson 1994). The next sections examine ",7,mtms2009-04-482a,,

"units on lineaR Quantities My research involved studying the generalizations of middle school students in different learning and teaching environments. One group consisted of seven eighth-grade algebra students who studied linear functions through a number-pattern approach. The class had a twelve-session unit on linear functions, and each session lasted one hour and fifty minutes. These sessions primarily used number tables to develop generalizations about linear growth. Seven of the thirty-four students in the class agreed to participate in a one-hour individual mathematics interview in which they solved problems and made generalizations. The interview problems were tailored each day to follow up on the tables and the situations that the students had seen in class. An example of two typical interview problems is shown in figure 1.

"Throughout the unit, the students encountered two real-world situations involving linearity: gear ratios and constant speed.

The students then worked with gears of differing sizes and were encouraged to generalize their ideas about the relationship between the rotations of any two gears. When the students moved on to the topic of speed, they worked with tasks such as the Frog Walking problem (fig. 2b). ",20,mtms2009-04-482a,,

He said, “On the x side, it’s going up by ones, and on the other side, it’s going up by . . . sevens.” The students who searched for patterns often found them within a column, rather than focusing on the relationship between corresponding (x, y) pairs in a table. Their focus on recursive patterns  in the columns meant that the students developed incorrect global rules about linearity that were dependent on uniform data tables. An example of such a global rule is Juliana’s statement about the number table posed during her interview (fig. 3b): “If it’s in a continuous pattern that’s the same every time, it comes out to be a line.” Global rules represent a student’s more general meaning for a concept, such as what constitutes linearity or what slope means. The eighth-grade students  as being linear, she believed that any set of data must have three patterns to make a line. The only explanation she could provide, however, was to point to several examples that showed the patterns in question. Because she had learned about linear functions in a classroom environment that heavily emphasized one particular type of table or pattern, it made sense that she would use only those tables when trying to justify her rule.",35,mtms2009-04-482a,,

"The seventh-grade students’ classroom environment emphasized a focus on quantities and how they were related to one another. The students’ reasoning included searching for relationships more than patterns, and their generalizations most often took the form of statements of continuing phenomena. Students searched for relationships connected to speed or gear ratios, because they focused on realistic problems within those two contexts. An example of searching for a relationship can be seen in Dora’s work (see fig. 4). The table represents the number of rotations that a small gear with 8 teeth (S) and a large gear with 12 teeth (L) made when connected. Unlike the tables that the eighth graders encountered, the values of the gear table did not increase by a uniform amount. Students had to figure out whether every pair in ",37,mtms2009-04-482a,,

"When Juliana was asked to justify her global rule, she made a graph to show that it worked (fig. 3b). She struggled, however, to explain why a continuous pattern meant that the data would make a line, saying, “If they’re all the same, it’s continuously, then it’s just gonna be like a little square. You just follow it.” Growing frustrated with being unable to clearly explain her thinking, Juliana looked over all the different number tables she had seen in class. She came up  with a more strict global rule: “For it to make a straight line, there has to be a pattern this way [gesturing down the x column], a pattern this way [gesturing down the y column], and a pattern going back and forth right here [gesturing across the columns].” Although Juliana’s new global rule was not correct for all tables, it made sense to her because she had never found any patterns in number tables that did not increase in even increments on the x column (i.e., x values increasing by 1 each time, or by 5 each time). Because those are the only tables that Juliana had ever identified ",41,mtms2009-04-482a,,

Dora focused on the quantities of the gear rotations as she reasoned about the relationship between the gears:,42,mtms2009-04-482a,,
"Dora: Think of a gear . . . one gear has  8 teeth, the other has 12. When you spin them, teeth pass through each other. For every 2/3 of the teeth passed on the large one, that’s 8 teeth; the small one turns once. If the small one goes 3 turns, the large one will go 2. So if the small goes 7  1/2 times, the large gear will go 5. You can figure this out by setting it up in a fraction . . . 5 over 7.5. Reduce it, and if it equals 2/3, then it’s right.",43,mtms2009-04-482a,,
"In contrast with Juliana’s reason- ing, Dora could draw on her understanding of the quantities in the situation to make sense of each pair. The number 2/3 held meaning for her as representing the ratio of the gears’ rotations. In addition, Dora’s quantitative understanding meant that a justification was embedded in her generalization: Because each tooth on the large gear matches with a tooth on the small gear, 8 teeth (or 2/3 of the teeth) on the large gear will equal one full rotation of the small gear.",44,mtms2009-04-482a,,

"The generalizations that the eighthgrade students made about linear functions were all similar to Juliana’s statement that there must be a pattern “every time,” or a table must have stable patterns down both columns. Although this statement is correct for tables that increase by a uniform amount, such as the amounts in  figure 3a, it will not be the case for nonuniform tables of data, as seen in figure 4. When the eighth-grade students did encounter nonuniform y = mx tables or any y = mx + b data, they struggled to make sense of those new problems and declared the data to be nonlinear. Mario explained why he thought a nonuniform table could not represent linear data: “It has to be a pattern that doesn’t change. You know? It has to be like 3, 6, 9, like that.”",48,mtms2009-04-482a,,

Teacher: What’s the general rule?,51,mtms2009-04-482a,,
"Larissa: If the relationship stays the same the whole time, if the frog  walks the same pace the whole time, or if you spin the gears the same . . . it will be a line. ",52,mtms2009-04-482a,,
"Larissa and her classmates could  explain and justify their solutions and generalizations, as seen in Dora’s work. However, the eighth-grade students struggled to provide coherent explanations, as seen with Juliana’s work. For instance, Larissa was able to explain how she made sense of the data in figure 5:",53,mtms2009-04-482a,,
"Larissa: Because you’re finding out  how many seconds it takes him to go x amount of cm or how many cm you go in x amount of seconds. So if he’s going the same, if it’s taking him the same time to go the same amount of cm, the whole, throughout the whole table, he’s going the same speed.",54,mtms2009-04-482a,,
"Timothy could then connect Larissa’s idea of speed to the idea of the slope of a graph, exclaiming, “I’ve been saying that the pace is the slope!” His explanation involved using numbers from a similar problem with a speed of 4/5 of a second per centimeter:",55,mtms2009-04-482a,,
"Timothy: The slope means that whatever x goes up by, 4/5 of that is how much y goes up by.",56,mtms2009-04-482a,,
Teacher: And what does 4/5 have to  do with the speed?,57,mtms2009-04-482a,,
"Timothy: It’s going basically 4/5 of a second per cm . . . basically it’s gonna be continuously the same  with a y = mx + b table of distance and time values, presented during class, in which a clown began walking a certain number of centimeters away from his home. The students were asked to find out whether the clown walked a constant speed or not by examining the table.",58,mtms2009-04-482a,,
"Timothy examined how far the  clown walked between 13.25 cm and 17 cm (3.75 cm) and in how much time (6 seconds). After dividing, he found the clown’s speed for that section of the journey was 0.625 cm per second. Timothy then checked to see whether that speed was stable throughout the table, which it was. Timothy explained, “For every second, he goes 5/8 of a centimeter.” This generalization is a statement of continuing phenomena because it reflects a focus on the dynamic relationship between quantities; it is characterized by a sense of continuation or extension. Students noticed and referenced continuing phenomena statements when they paid attention to the quantities in question. Both speed and gear rotations were characterized by a smooth, dynamic motion.",59,mtms2009-04-482a,,

"Notice that the students’ generalizations about linearity relied on references to the quantities of centimeter, second, and speed. The classroom emphasis on these quantities, and the ways in which the students reasoned with them, suggests that working with quantitative relationships can support students’ abilities to extend and justify their generalizations. ",61,mtms2009-04-482a,,
"Although the eighth-grade students could at times make correct generalizations, these generalizations were not well connected to other knowledge. The students struggled to extend their ideas to new situations, such as y = mx + b scenarios. The seventh-grade students, however, were able to explain and support their ideas specifically by appealing to their understanding of quantities in the situation. Their tendency to rely on a quantitative understanding to support their reasoning suggests that helping students make correct generalizations is not the only goal to keep in mind; in addition, we should try to help students generalize from relationships that are meaningful to them.",62,mtms2009-04-482a,,
