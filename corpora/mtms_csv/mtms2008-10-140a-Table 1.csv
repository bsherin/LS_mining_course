The lesson involved applying principles of geometry and using measurement and calculations to interpret observations of the sun’s apparent movement across the sky during the day. An upright pointer, which is the modern equivalent of an ancient device called the gnomon, produced shadows that were then tracked. The observations of the shadows were used to find the direction of geographic north.  which to collect data and two familiar mathematical tools, the ruler and compass, to complete the experiment.  integRating histoRY, cUltURe, and MatheMatics",2,mtms2008-10-140a,,
"History plays an important role in the study of all subjects at the Ross School, including mathematics and science. In the eighth grade, the medieval Islamic empire is a major topic of study. Islamic religious practice requires knowing how to orient oneself and how to tell time. In medieval times, the science of astronomy filled those needs. The science curriculum at the Ross School includes positional astronomy, which addresses learning from direct observations of the sky. These observations promote connections with cultural history and provide opportunities for hands-on investigations.  noon",3,mtms2008-10-140a,,

"One objective of this astronomy unit connecting mathematics and science involved the conception of noon. Clock noon is an abstract concept based on the notion that the interval from midday today to midday tomorrow ought to be the same every day of the year. Before accurate mechanical clocks were perfected, there was a different concept of midday, called solar noon, which derived from direct observation of the sun’s apparent movement across the sky. Solar noon is defined as the instant when the sun’s position in the sky is highest when compared with any other time during that day. Astronomers refer to the angle from the horizon to the sun as the angle of elevation, so another way of defining solar noon is when the sun’s angle of elevation is greatest for a particular day. At that time, the length of shadows will be the shortest. (See fig. 1.)",10,mtms2008-10-140a,,
"The time of solar noon is almost never the same as clock noon. Think about time zones: Clock noon and solar noon could only be the same by happenstance of location. The sun appears highest above the horizon in some location for observer A at the moment when the earth is turned to align observer A’s longitude with the direction of the sun. At a different  location, observer B will see solar noon at the same moment only if A and B’s longitude is the same. Observers everywhere within one time zone experience clock noon at the same moment, but there is at most one longitude in a time zone where clock noon and solar noon will coincide. ",11,mtms2008-10-140a,,
"As a further complication, the time interval from solar noon one day to solar noon the next day is seldom exactly twenty-four clock hours. Solar noon changes from day to day throughout the year. If clock noon and solar noon coincide on one day, then the next day at the same location they would not. Additional information on the complexities of this idea is described in the equation of time (Green 1985). It is not our objective for students to learn the details; however, we do expect them to realize that solar noon and clock noon are different. Historically, clock noon and clock time have been in wide use only since instant communication by telegraph, telephone, and radio, which globalized our measurement of time; synchronization of distant clocks was difficult and unnecessary before these forms of communication were used, so solar noon and solar time were sufficient. In science class, the students discovered and learned three important facts about solar noon:  •  Solar noon is the moment dur- ing the day when the sun appears the highest above the horizon and when shadows are the shortest.  •  Solar noon is the moment that divides the time interval from sunrise to sunset exactly in half.",12,mtms2008-10-140a,,
•  Solar noon is the moment when  shadows point directly north in the northern hemisphere or directly south in the southern hemisphere. ,13,mtms2008-10-140a,,
"The students learned these facts in several ways involving multiple representations. Students used the interactive computer program Starry Night (www.starrynight.com) to familiarize themselves with the daily apparent motion of the sun across the sky. They also manipulated a simple and inexpensive three-dimensional handheld model, the Solar Motion Demonstrator (www.astrosociety.org) to reinforce their understanding. To conclude the learning experience, students made outdoor sun-shadow observations and analyzed the results in an integrated mathematics and science lesson.  setting UP the eXPeRiMent",14,mtms2008-10-140a,,
"On a sunny day, with the help of their science teacher, students set up their experiment. A large piece of paper, approximately one meter square, was attached to a smooth, level surface, and a shadow stick was placed ",15,mtms2008-10-140a,,
"Fig. 2 A sheet of paper is laid flat for recording the shadow of a vertical pointer on the paper near the southern edge (see fig. 2). The shadow stick needs to be positioned on the southern edge of the paper so that the tip of its shadow will fit on the paper. It is necessary for students to know which directions are north and south before placing the shadow stick. To make the shadow stick, a ring stand from the science lab was used to support it. The exact location of the stick—that is, the point directly under the stick—must be marked carefully on the paper. Observations were taken at several times throughout the day, starting well before noon, and data points were recorded before and after midday. For each data point, students marked the spot where the shadow of the tip of the stick fell on the paper. The first observation was made.  Students and their teacher discussed  the fact that the shadow tip was fuzzy because the sun appeared  as a disk, not a point of light; the mark made was roughly half a centimeter. For each observation, the time was written next to the mark. Subsequent observations were made by individual students throughout the day, between classes or during the lunch period, although five data points were sufficient. ",16,mtms2008-10-140a,,
"When the experiment was  finished, the science teacher took a digital photograph of the large piece of paper with the shadow points and the shadow stick clearly marked so that these elements could be transferred to an activity sheet (see fig. 3). The photograph was then uploaded to a computer so that each student could receive an activity sheet with the marked data points. Any other ",17,mtms2008-10-140a,,

This completed the preparation for the mathematics and science lesson. ",25,mtms2008-10-140a,,
"With guidance from their teachers, students analyzed the data from the outdoor observation and transferred that information to the activity sheet. The goal of the lesson was to calculate the time of solar noon on the day that the data were collected. The first step toward this goal was to find the location of the shadow at solar noon. To do so, one must first find two different times when the shadow lengths were exactly equal. These two times would have occurred at equal intervals before and after solar noon. We made observations in the morning and afternoon so that we could geometrically construct an afternoon shadow at the time somewhere between the two actual observations. In so doing, the shadow length in the afternoon would exactly match a morning shadow length. ",26,mtms2008-10-140a,,
"The location on the original  observation paper that was directly under the shadow stick must be known; it was marked by a cross at point O on the activity sheet (fig. 3). Placing the point of a compass at O, ",27,mtms2008-10-140a,,
Note: Times of 12:32 p.m. and 1:05 p.m. are unique to the measurements made by this group of students.,28,mtms2008-10-140a,,
"students adjusted the compass opening so that the pencil point touched a morning observation, point A at 11:30 a.m., and then they drew an arc from that point toward the afternoon observations. For most, this arc did not touch any of the afternoon observation times: The time after noon when the shadow length equaled the morning length will fall between two afternoon observations. For example, at point B at 1:05 p.m., the shadow length was too short to match the morning observation and at point C at 2:15 p.m., the shadow was too long. Students had to estimate where the shadow length equaled the morning length by drawing a line from B to C, then seeing where this line intersected the arc through point A, at point D. Once point D was found, students knew where the shadow length in the afternoon equaled the  morning shadow length; the shadow at solar noon was then constructed by bisecting the angle AOD. The bisector located the shadow position at solar noon and the direction of north. ",29,mtms2008-10-140a,,
"Once students had this bisector,  they were able to measure its distance from neighboring observations. They used proportions to estimate the time of day that solar noon occurred; a second activity sheet guided them (fig. 4).  1:05 p.m.",30,mtms2008-10-140a,,

Care must be taken to preserve the orientation of the experiment. The paper and shadow stick should be in the exact locations they were on the first day. The students repeated their steps, then performed an analysis on the new set of points. They then realized that the angle bisector still pointed north, even though the time was different. This result was both unexpected and surprising at first to the students. However, they remembered the three main facts about solar noon and were able to understand their findings.

"This activity took one forty- seven-minute class period, not including the data collection and preparation of the activity sheets.
