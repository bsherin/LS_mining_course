The first chapter, “On the Foundations of Mathematics” from 1926, was an interesting read. From it, I gained perspective, realizing that the discussion of reform mathematics rings true in present-day mathematics education. I also enjoyed the abstract introducing each chapter in which the editors gave some background information about the material and what the reader would find interesting. This is a nice touch that this reader appreciated. I especially enjoyed some of the chapters that provided some problem-solving activities.",8,Window on Resources - April 2014

We do not want to wait and see if  students fail, but rather offer opportunities for them to respond to lessons that differentiate and scaffold to build on the skills necessary to develop the knowledge base, competencies, and skills in mathematics” (p. 3).
