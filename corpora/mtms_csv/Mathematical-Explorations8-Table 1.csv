3,Mathematical Explorations: Finding Pi with Archimedess Exhaustion Method,"Studying historical puzzles can give students a perspective on the usefulness of math as a tool and on the creative aspects of problem solving. Pi Day offers a wonderful opportunity for such inquiry. My students and I have enjoyed retracing and applying some parts of Archimedes’s method of exhaustion to measure the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter. Archimedes lived from 287 BCE until 212 BCE and was one of the greatest mathematicians of all times, as well as an extraordinarily creative problem solver. He formulated how to approximate the circumference of a circle using a sequence of inscribed and circumscribed regular polygons whose perimeters converged to the circumference (see fi gs. 1a−b). His system was a precursor to calculus, specifi cally the concept of limit, which we briefl y discussed at the end of our lesson.

However, they may not always understand its real meaning or may not know how this formula was discovered. As students explore the process that led to the discovery of C = pd, they will develop a better appreciation of the nature of mathematics and of the profound connections between the various areas of this discipline.",5,Mathematical Explorations: Finding Pi with Archimedess Exhaustion Method
6,Mathematical Explorations: Finding Pi with Archimedess Exhaustion Method,"Studying math in context gives students the opportunity to participate in real-life problem solving as well as recognize the usefulness of mathematics. This activity can also offer a glimpse into the intellectual development of some fascinating ideas, a closer look at Archimedes’s work, and the occasion to think and communicate mathematically about higher-order mathematical concepts.",6,Mathematical Explorations: Finding Pi with Archimedess Exhaustion Method
7,Mathematical Explorations: Finding Pi with Archimedess Exhaustion Method,"Ask students to research some aspect of Archimedes’s life and the mathematical issues he confronted. Students can then share what they learned with the class. This is generally a wellreceived activity and a good introduction to the history of mathematics. To calculate the value of pi, my students used a method similar to Archimedes’s, although it did not involve applying the great mathematician’s precise geometric ratios, concepts well beyond the geom-",7,Mathematical Explorations: Finding Pi with Archimedess Exhaustion Method

Instead, my students used a more experimental approach by directly measuring the lengths of the sides of the polygons using rulers and yardsticks.",9,Mathematical Explorations: Finding Pi with Archimedess Exhaustion Method
10,Mathematical Explorations: Finding Pi with Archimedess Exhaustion Method,"Activity sheet 1 provides  guidelines on how to replicate this process in a classroom. After sharing some information about Archimedes and breaking into groups, students drew a circle using a string of fixed length (the radius) tied to a clasp at the center. To make students’ calculations easier, we chose radii equal to  1/2 foot, 1/2 yard, or 1/2 meter so that the length of the circumference would (theoretically) equal pi—feet, yards, or meters, respectively. Then the students inscribed a regular hexagon. First, they chose a point on the circumference. Then, with the compass open and using the same radius, they pointed the compass at their chosen point and drew a semicircle that cut the circumference at two more points.",10,Mathematical Explorations: Finding Pi with Archimedess Exhaustion Method
11,Mathematical Explorations: Finding Pi with Archimedess Exhaustion Method,"The students used their rulers and connected each point on the circumference with the center of the circle. They then extended the segment to reach the circumference on the other side of the center, producing three more vertices. They next connected the vertices by drawing a regular hexagon. The students took turns measuring the six sides of the polygon and recorded and added their data, determining the perimeter of the polygon and an estimate of the length of the circumference. Then, the averages of the measurements found by each student in a group were added; the group mean—their first approximation of p—was then calculated. Each student used table 1 to track results, and each group collected the data from each member in table 2.",11,Mathematical Explorations: Finding Pi with Archimedess Exhaustion Method
12,Mathematical Explorations: Finding Pi with Archimedess Exhaustion Method,"The students then doubled the  number of sides of the polygon to obtain a dodecagon. They produced this shape by drawing (or constructing, for the more advanced students) the perpendicular bisector of each side. (This line intersects the circumference at one point, a vertex of the inscribed regular dodecagon.) Once all the vertices were created and connected, the  table 1 Each student used a grid to track and organize the inscribed polygon data.",12,Mathematical Explorations: Finding Pi with Archimedess Exhaustion Method

21,Mathematical Explorations: Finding Pi with Archimedess Exhaustion Method,"Dodecagon 24-gon students again measured the perimeter of the dodecagon using the same procedure outlined above. Some groups doubled the number of sides to construct and find the perimeter of a 24gon (see fig. 2). Using Archimedes’s method in its entirety, the students could also construct circumscribed polygons. This part of the activity, and the corresponding approximation of p, is described in activity sheet 2. ",21,Mathematical Explorations: Finding Pi with Archimedess Exhaustion Method
22,Mathematical Explorations: Finding Pi with Archimedess Exhaustion Method,"Activity sheet 3 invites students  to think in depth about Archimedes’s procedure for approximating p and to ponder its creativity and meaning. I found that students realized that as the number of sides of the inscribed and circumscribed polygons increases, Archimedes’s procedure would produce a lower and an upper limit for the value of p. Students concluded that as the number of sides increases indefinitely, the perimeter of the polygons approaches the circumference, and their area, the area of the circle.",22,Mathematical Explorations: Finding Pi with Archimedess Exhaustion Method

28,Mathematical Explorations: Finding Pi with Archimedess Exhaustion Method,"The experimental, hands-on  approach that we used to find the perimeter of the various polygons by directly measuring the sides with rulers and yardsticks presented a few challenges and corresponding learning opportunities. Students found out that they needed to be precise when drawing. Some groups decided to practice the constructions a few times on separate sheets of paper; others asked the most meticulous student to complete the drawings. ",28,Mathematical Explorations: Finding Pi with Archimedess Exhaustion Method
29,Mathematical Explorations: Finding Pi with Archimedess Exhaustion Method,"A more important intellectual  hurdle was the presence of measurement errors, as middle school students are often surprised by the variation in the readings (see fig. 3) and by the notion of significant digits. Students, especially at the middle school level, are often exposed only to problems with precise numerical answers and do not expect to find errors in a math problem. These complexities led to interesting conversations and to a desire to understand how wrong our finding of p was—or how far our estimated value was from the generally accepted value, which we studied with the   extension activities (available online). In closing, my students responded  enthusiastically to this exploration, which provided a very intuitive and logical introduction to basic concepts of calculus, such as that of limit. This approach not only places mathematics in context and highlights the connections and the creativity involved in complex problem solving but also offers a glimpse of higher-order thinking. It also helps demystify some advanced mathematical concepts.",29,Mathematical Explorations: Finding Pi with Archimedess Exhaustion Method
