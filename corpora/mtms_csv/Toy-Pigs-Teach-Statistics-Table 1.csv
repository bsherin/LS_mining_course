0,Toy Pigs Teach Statistics - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Do you want a lesson that can integrate the Common Coreâ€™s Standards for Mathematical Practice while your students learn and practice content related to statistics and probability? A set of games and activities using plastic toy pigs might just do the trick.,,
1,Toy Pigs Teach Statistics - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Research shows that playing games in the classroom improves studentsâ€™ attitudes toward mathematics, increases motivation to practice skills inside and outside the classroom, and increases learning by encouraging students of all levels to participate (Davies 1995). Rutherford asserts that playing games encourages strategic mathematical thinking and supports development of computational fluency (Rutherford 2015). The following set of activities address experimental and theoretical probability, rules of probability, graphing, and number sense while integrating the Standards for Mathematical Practice (SMP).",,
2,Toy Pigs Teach Statistics - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,PLAYING WITH PIGS,,
3,Toy Pigs Teach Statistics - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Students typically explore probability using dice or cards. Their familiarity with these objects enables them to determine the answers to questions, but it does not encourage a deeper understanding of probability concepts as applied in a larger context. Show toy pigs, similar to those in the Hasbro game Pass the PigsÂ®, to students, followed by this directive: â€œMake a list of all the positions that the pig could land in if it is tossed in the air or rolled like a die.â€",,
4,Toy Pigs Teach Statistics - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"After students have written the potential elements of the sample space, ask them to predict the probability of each outcome. Inevitably, students will predict that the events in the sample space are equally likely. Students tend to struggle with the concept of nonâ€“equally likely events, which seems to be reinforced through the use of regular dice in probability experiments. This myth of equal probability is quickly debunked but retained long term as students begin to play with the toy pigs. At the time, discuss the term sample space. After students have experience rolling the toy pigs, their misconceptions concerning probabilities can be addressed.",,
5,Toy Pigs Teach Statistics - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,ACTIVITY 1: CREATING AN EXPERIMENT,,
6,Toy Pigs Teach Statistics - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Before activity 1 begins, introduce basic vocabulary, including these terms: sample space, experiment, and experimental and theoretical probability. Students will have the opportunity to apply these new terms as they create their own experiment.",,
7,Toy Pigs Teach Statistics - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Have groups execute their own experiment, thus allowing students to better understand the concept of a random sample, sampling techniques, and quality data. Since no parameters are mandated, students will have different sample sizes and different sampling, or rolling, techniques. Additionally, some groups will differentiate between left sides and right sides and others will not. After performing the experiment and creating graphs, students share their results with the class. At this point, students begin to understand the specificity required to create a good experiment because data collected without distinguishing between sides cannot be used to make predictions concerning the probability of a pig landing on the right side or left side. However, those students who separated right sides and left sides in their data collection can combine their data to answer the original question, â€œWhat is the probability of a pig landing on its side?â€ Discuss the inherent variability caused in sampling, which will lead directly to activity 2.",,
8,Toy Pigs Teach Statistics - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,ACTIVITY 2: DETERMINING EXPERIMENTAL PROBABILITY,,
9,Toy Pigs Teach Statistics - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Before students begin rolling pigs, hold a class discussion to determine ways to minimize the variability in sampling, such as how to roll the pigs, how many pigs to roll at once, at what height the pigs should be rolled, and possible oddities that may happen (pigs touching, pigs falling off the table, and so on). Students then begin rolling pigs and complete the table in activity 2. After students have rolled their pigs and reported their data, discuss the sampling distribution. The concept of a sampling distribution concerns the distribution of all values of a statistic when all possible samples of the same size are taken from the population. This concept is difficult for students at all ages and grade levels. However, introducing it early through the use of various graphs helps begin the process of creating informed consumers of information. Since each group rolled the pig 50 times under the same conditions, we have a sample proportion to approximate the probability of a pig landing in any given position. However, depending on which groupâ€™s data we choose to use, we could get very different answers (see fig. 1).",,
10,Toy Pigs Teach Statistics - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
11,Toy Pigs Teach Statistics - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"By averaging the sample proportions from each group, we can get a good approximation of the population proportion of a pig landing in any one of the various positions (see fig. 2).",,
12,Toy Pigs Teach Statistics - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
13,Toy Pigs Teach Statistics - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,ACTIVITY 3: EXPLORING A LARGE NUMBER OF SAMPLES,,
14,Toy Pigs Teach Statistics - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I have accumulated data from numerous classes, thus creating the best approximation of a population parameter available at this time.",,
15,Toy Pigs Teach Statistics - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
16,Toy Pigs Teach Statistics - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"As seen in table 1, students have rolled the pigs more than 7000 times. These numbers give a good approximation of theoretical probability through the Law of Large Numbers, which states that as the number of sample trials increases, the difference between the sample proportion and population proportion approaches zero. By comparing the data from group A and group K, the reader can see the variation in the samples. When the sample proportion of pigs landing on their feet has been averaged for each group, the proportion of the sampling distribution is .073, which is a reasonable approximation to the .071 assumed to be the population average. The same can be shown for all other landing positions of the pigs. This concrete example, which is referred to throughout the class, has proven to be a beneficial introduction to the concept of sampling distribution.",,
17,Toy Pigs Teach Statistics - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Using the relative frequency data for the position of pigs (see table 1), ask students to predict the probability of rolling 1 pig and having it land on its feet or its back (or any other potential combination). After many of the â€œorâ€ possibilities have been explored, ask students to predict the probability of rolling 1 pig two consecutive times and having it land on its feet and its back (or any one of the fourteen possibilities listed in table 2). Note that students have not been exposed to the addition rule",,
18,Toy Pigs Teach Statistics - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
19,Toy Pigs Teach Statistics - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) â€“ P(A and B),,
20,Toy Pigs Teach Statistics - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,or the multiplication rule for independent events,,
21,Toy Pigs Teach Statistics - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,P(A and B) = P(A) â€¢ P(B),,
22,Toy Pigs Teach Statistics - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,at this time.,,
23,Toy Pigs Teach Statistics - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"When time allows, ask students to roll pigs for activity 3. If there is no time, hold a class discussion to illustrate how the data in table 1 can be used through the addition and/or multiplication rule to obtain the results in table 2. For example, the probability of rolling 1 pig that lands on its feet or its back is",,
24,Toy Pigs Teach Statistics - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,P(F) + P(B) = .071 + .327 = .398.,,
25,Toy Pigs Teach Statistics - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,The probability of a pig landing on its feet and back in two consecutive rolls can be found by,,
26,Toy Pigs Teach Statistics - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,P(F) â€¢ P(B) = .071 â€¢ .327 â€¢ 2 â‰ˆ .046.,,
27,Toy Pigs Teach Statistics - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Although this is not the exact result shown in table 2, it nevertheless leads to a good discussion concerning the difference between theoretical and experimental probability. In this instance, it is important to note that we must multiply by 2 because the order of the two events does not matter.",,
28,Toy Pigs Teach Statistics - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"These activities will help familiarize students with basic and compound probabilities, sampling variability, and the vocabulary. How can students use these data and apply their new knowledge? Creating and playing a game, assigning point values, and then analyzing the results will encourage students to make sense of the problem and the data, reason abstractly and quantitatively, think critically, solve problems, and critique the reasoning of others for a deeper understanding of the content. Pass the Pigs is a good example of such a game (see activity 4).",,
29,Toy Pigs Teach Statistics - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,ACTIVITY 4: PLAYING PASS THE PIGS,,
30,Toy Pigs Teach Statistics - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Of course, the game could be played first to set the stage for obtaining the data. Either way, the game requires students to use the data to create a strategy to optimize their possibility of winning. Rich discussion follows the game once students answer the discussion questions. As an extension, ask students to create their own rules and assign point values to increase their level of thinking critically about the data. All students should be able to create a game that matches their own ability.",,
31,Toy Pigs Teach Statistics - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,REMEMBERING PIGS AND PROBABILITY,,
32,Toy Pigs Teach Statistics - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Students remember this activity long after it is over. Throughout the class, students are able to refer to this activity to better understand sampling distributions, compound probabilities, the Law of Large Numbers, and the fact that they actually enjoyed learning in math class.",,
