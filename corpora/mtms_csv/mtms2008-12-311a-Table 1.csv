Middle-grades students often use it to choose the person who will go first in some activity or larger game. This game also provides a rich context to explore the relationship between experimental and theoretical probability through the concept of a fair game. Research finds that students learn best from classroom activities that connect to real-world problems (NCTM 2000; Sutton and Krueger 2002).,3,mtms2008-12-311a,,
"The activities described here address the following Standards from Principles and Standards for School Mathematics (NCTM 2000, p. 248):  •  Develop and evaluate inferences and predictions that are based on data •  Understand and apply basic concepts of probability",4,mtms2008-12-311a,,
"In this article, we present three activities that we have used to promote probabilistic thinking with middlegrades students. ",5,mtms2008-12-311a,,
"Activity 1 uses experimental probability as students play the game of rock, paper, scissors several times and record their results. In activity 2, a table and a tree diagram help students  understand the theoretical probability behind the game. The extension in activity 3 allows three people to play the game. The student results ",6,mtms2008-12-311a,,
"Using the game of rock, paper,  scissors, we distinguish between two types of probabilities: experimental and theoretical. Experimental probability, determined by conducting an experiment repeatedly, uses the frequency of the outcomes and the relative frequency to estimate probabilities. In contrast, theoretical probability calculates the probability of each outcome based on known or theoretical premises and possibly calculations.  cheryl nelson, cnelson@winona.edu, and nicole Williams, nwilliams@ winona.edu, are colleagues in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Winona State University in Minnesota. They are interested in strengthening preservice teachers’ understanding of mathematics through rich investigative activities. ",7,mtms2008-12-311a,,

Activity 2 begins with students completing a table to find the theoretical probability of each hand choice. It continues as students create a tree diagram to obtain the same probability results. Students compare the two formats and extend the tree diagram to compute additional probabilities. ,21,mtms2008-12-311a,,
"As table 2 shows, if two players  randomly choose a hand shape, then each of the nine outcomes in the table is equally likely. Hence, it can be seen that P(player A wins) = 3/9, P(player B wins) = 3/9, and P(tie) = 3/9. ",22,mtms2008-12-311a,,
"Rock, paper, scissors can be considered a multistage experiment and analyzed using a tree diagram. We filled out the first branch to get students started, and they completed the rest of the diagram, as shown in figure 1.",23,mtms2008-12-311a,,
"Fig. 1 Tree diagram illustrating the probabilities for rock (R), paper (P), and scissors (S) we describe can give middle-grades mathematics teachers valuable insight into adapting these activities to fit their classroom needs.  activity 1: Playing the gaMe—exPeRiMental PRobability",24,mtms2008-12-311a,,
"Before starting the activity, the rules should be discussed. Typically, two volunteers come to the front of the class and demonstrate the game. Before playing, we ask the class if the game is fair and provide an explanation. Making predictions and testing conjectures aligns with the NCTM’s Data Analysis and Probability Standard for grades 6−8, so this is an important part of the activity. At this point, rich classroom discussion results in comments such as these:  •  “I think it is fair because each person  has three shapes to choose from.” •  “It is not fair because some people  cheat. They delay showing their shape and wait for the other person to show their shape.”",25,mtms2008-12-311a,,
"When we ask students how they would prove that the game is fair, none of them have any ideas. In response, we suggest that they play the game to explore its fairness.",26,mtms2008-12-311a,,
"As indicated on the activity sheet, students should form groups of three, in which two students play the game 45 times and the third student records the results. Table 1 offers a convenient record-keeping device. ",27,mtms2008-12-311a,,
"After completing the experiment, students use their results to determine whether the game seemed fair or not, which leads to a discussion of what fair means from a probability perspective. In a fair game, each player has an equal chance of winning. The fairness of the game can then be considered from a theoretical perspective using two formats: a table and a tree diagram. ",28,mtms2008-12-311a,,
"Our class discussion included how to calculate the final probability along the branches of a tree diagram. We discussed that generally, player A will choose rock 1/3 of the time and of that 1/3, player B will choose rock 1/3 of the time; 1/3 of 1/3 leads to RR (rock rock) occurring 1/9 of the time. It is important for students to compare the table and the tree diagram formats to verify that the probability results are the same. They can see that the results are simply being represented differently. When we asked students to compare the two formats, responses included these:  •  “The ties are on the diagonal in the  table. There are no T’s on the tree diagram.” •  “The ties on the tree diagram are  indicated by RR, PP, and SS.” •  “The table is simpler than the tree  diagram because all you have to do is count the number of T’s, A’s, or B’s.” ",29,mtms2008-12-311a,,

activity 3:  Playing With thRee Students are surprised that this game can be played with three people. Including a third player challenges students to determine how to make the game fair. There are many ways to accomplish this fairness goal. It is interesting to see how creative students can be when left to their own resources. ,36,mtms2008-12-311a,,
"As our students played this game using the rules given on the activity page, they soon discovered that the game was not fair and that player B had an overwhelming advantage over the other two. We compared and contrasted the twoplayer game to the three-player game. At some point, students realized there was no possibility for a tie in our version of the three-player game. Each group then decided to make new rules when players A, B, and C win, and some incorporated the possibility of ties. Figure 2 explores two different sets of rules that students created to make the game fair.  conclUding ReMaRks",37,mtms2008-12-311a,,
"As students discuss the fairness of this game, interesting questions can be posed.  •  Is it a fair game if you play the  game only once?  •  When people play this game, do  they tend to choose a certain hand shape more often than another shape in the other two?  •  Can someone be “better than”  another person at this game? How?",38,mtms2008-12-311a,,
"Middle-grades students need tasks that develop their mathematical reasoning. Principles and Standards advocates that students should make and validate conjectures based on data. Rock, paper, scissors for two or three players meets these criteria and piques students’ curiosity. Throughout these activities, students were encouraged to reflect and defend their intuition regarding the game. ",39,mtms2008-12-311a,,
