The Amazing Algebra Book contains twenty number tricks for students in prealgebra and algebra. A Teacher Notes section introduces each trick and gives an example and explanation of how it works. The notes include a list of properties that apply to the specific trick and required basic mathematics skills. Suggestions are given for its use in large- or small-group instruction. A reproducible student page has step-by-step instructions so that students can learn and perform the trick. Extensions and suggestions for further investigations are also on the reproducible page.,2,mtms2008-10-190a,,
"The book also contains a complete  list of how these tricks fit into the NCTM’s Standards as well as the state standards for New Jersey and California. These lists can be used by  teachers in other states, as well.",3,mtms2008-10-190a,,
"Most of the tricks require only paper  and pencil, which make them easy to use. I would advise anyone using this book to take full advantage of the mathematical explanations to show students how they work. After practicing several of the selections in the book, gifted and advanced learners should be able to create some of their own tricks, based on the properties of algebra. ",4,mtms2008-10-190a,,
"Students in advanced grades 6–8  classes would benefit from the lessons in The Amazing Algebra Book. High school mathematics classes should enjoy the book, as well. These tricks will give students insight into the properties of algebra that they may often see as being of little use.",5,mtms2008-10-190a,,

cognitive neuroscience while presenting possible implications  for learning mathematics. ,9,mtms2008-10-190a,,
"This book’s  eight chapters focus on how children build on their innate number sense and how they learn to perform basic arithmetic calculations. Also explored are findings from cognitive neuroscience dealing with the basic elements of learning (e.g., memory systems, timing, practice, benefits of writing, learning styles, and teaching styles). The chapters also discuss teaching mathematics with the brain in mind to students from the preschool level to adolescent, differentiating mathematics instruction, and how research from cognitive neuroscience impacts lesson plans designed to enhance learning and retention. In the final chapter, Sousa outlines a four-step model for teaching mathematics.",10,mtms2008-10-190a,,
"This book gives the reader valuable information that could be used to improve mathematics instruction and increase the mathematical success of students. Although not intended to be a resource book of mathematics activities for the classroom, it does provide examples of meaningful activities and instructional strategies for helping students learn mathematics.

"In Active Learning in the Mathematics Classroom, Grades 5–8, author Hope Martin has compiled numerous mathematics activities relating the NCTM’s Content and Process Standards. The book is organized as follows: A brief introduction describes the mathematics skills and concepts contained in each lesson, and a list of materials, suggestions for instruction, selected answers, and supplementary and extension activities are also explored. This second edition, the author states, goes beyond the first well-received book in which she responded to feedback from readers by adding fifteen new activities, including a section titled “Active Algebra,” and updated mathematics activities.",15,mtms2008-10-190a,,
"Many of the activities may be familiar to mathematics teachers, including folding a tangram, using pentominoes and painted cubes, and calculating probability using dice. However, it is very convenient to have these activities compiled in one book, and there are other activities that will be new. This can be your go-to reference for reinforcing a concept, patching holes in your own curriculum, and more. ",16,mtms2008-10-190a,,
Two groups of sixth- and eighthgrade students of mine worked on an intensive mathematical palindromes activity. Students found substantial  success. An advanced algebra class worked on the algebra joke activity sheets. They enjoyed answering algebraic clues to find the word or phrase answer to the joke.,17,mtms2008-10-190a,,
"Overall, this is a wonderful supplement to the middle school teacher’s classroom. And if there is room for improvement on a future edition, it would be that the answer keys are selective. Teachers could use examples of possible answers to understand the scope of the activity.",18,mtms2008-10-190a,,

"If you are looking for a resource with ideas on how to present a topic with a different spin, this is the book for you. Aimed at teachers of students aged ten to fourteen, each activity is described with a summary of the overall concept, the process skills used, the prerequisite skills and knowledge, the targeted age group, the mathematical idea behind the activity, and a list of helpful terms. How-to reproducible activity sheets round out the book. The topics range from big numbers to the distributive property to an investigation of fractals. There is something for everyone. Many of the activities can be used with children younger than ten years to introduce a topic. If the book has a weakness, it is that the topics are not grouped according to the strands of the NCTM’s Standards. Although there is a chart of the content areas addressed by each activity in the beginning of the book, having the activities grouped might be helpful.",22,mtms2008-10-190a,,
I highly recommend this book to  both the new and the veteran teacher. The activities can spice up your lessons and inspire more activity-based learning.,23,mtms2008-10-190a,,

"As the title so aptly describes, this book explores many different ideas concerning at-risk students. It begins with a look into the fundamental problems causing failure in mathematics and science. The author sites deficiencies that include the insufficient preparation of preservice teachers, inadequate professional development for all teachers, and the use of homogeneous grouping and tracking of students, among others. The author then suggests some approaches in two areas: (1) long-range strategies that include whole-language approaches, contextual learning, action research, inclusive education, and more; and (2) short-term strategies that include curriculum redevelopment, curriculum design, and curriculum implementation. Substrategies incorporate overviews of allocating resources, needs assessments, thematic planning, and many other topics.",29,mtms2008-10-190a,,

"Mathemania Series 3 is a collection of six DVDs on geometry designed for use in the middle school classroom. Each DVD is about 30 minutes long and gives a brief overview of selected concepts. A good use of the DVDs would be at the beginning of a unit when students are first learning specific vocabulary terms or are being introduced to a concept for the first time. Some units presented in the series  are Triangles and Quadrilaterals, Geometric Constructions, Coordinate Geometry, Geometric Transformations, Naming and Measuring Angles, and Similarity, Ratios and Proportions. Many of the DVDs cover topics that are no longer included or pertinent to the middle school curriculum. Considering that at least half of these DVDs cover topics that are now taught in the high school classroom, this series may be more useful to high school geometry teachers. However, the tone of the series is designed for the middle school classroom, so it may be too slow paced for high school students.",33,mtms2008-10-190a,,
"If you are teaching an advanced  mathematics class at the middle school level and are looking for additional materials to supplement your teaching or are a high school teacher with a below-grade-level class, then this DVD series would be a worthwhile investment, because it introduces a variety of topics. However, if you do not teach these two types of classes, then you may want to skip this series.",34,mtms2008-10-190a,,
