9,Integrating Mathematics and Science: Ecology and Venn Diagrams,"State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSM) and the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) reveals many interdisciplinary themes in mathematics and science. For example, the Common Core’s Standards for Mathematical Practice encourage us to engage students to construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others (SMP 3), model with mathematics (SMP 4), use appropriate tools strategically (SMP 5), and  look for and make use of structure (SMP 7). The science and engineering practices proposed in the NGSS call for students to develop and use models (practice 2), analyze and interpret data (practice 4), use mathematics reasoning (practice 5), engage in argument from evidence (practice 7), and communicate information (practice 7). Mathematics teachers can merge these practices in the classroom, despite the pressures associated with high-stakes testing, teachers’ knowledge of science content, and a lack of administrative and peer support.  science have been widely recognized by mathematics and science educators. However, successful integration of these two important school disciplines remains a challenge. Although one can hardly imagine a lesson in physical science or earth science that does not contain mathematical procedure, examples of mathematics lessons in which science content or processes (or both) act to enhance student learning of mathematics are less common.

Workshop topics included the surface area of leaves and photosynthesis, shapes of nonlinear graphs and average monthly air temperatures, congruent angles and ratios in mirror reflections, and data analysis and the periodic table. In one workshop, participants engaged in a math exploration based on the article “What If We Were Built Like Dinosaurs?” (Quebec Fuentes, Garruto, and Lockard 2007) and prepared scaled drawings of humans using the body proportions of dinosaurs.

Based on a series of questions designated by the teacher, the students moved to appropriate locations within (or outside) the Venn diagram. This introductory activity also enabled students to think about the meaning of regions in a Venn diagram by contextualizing mathematical terms like intersection, union, and set.

As a result, only two groups made Venn diagrams, and the remaining students formed categories without a Venn diagram. For instance, one group focused on the animals’ size and formed three nonoverlapping categories: small, medium, and big (see fig. 4). When presenting this group’s poster to the class, one student exclaimed, “I didn’t even think to do a Venn diagram,” when he saw what two other groups had done.

103,Integrating Mathematics and Science: Ecology and Venn Diagrams,"In the second class, students were  directed to draw Venn diagrams to organize the cards, without other limitations. Not surprisingly, they were productive in creating Venn diagrams. An example of a poster with interrelated categories of carnivores, omnivores, herbivores, and insectivores is shown in figure 5a. It is interesting to note that at least one group of teachers generated a similar diagram during their professional development experience (see fig. 5b).

104,Integrating Mathematics and Science: Ecology and Venn Diagrams,"In two other classes, we adjusted the activity to encourage participation by all. In the first adaptation, we gave a handful of cards to each group member and asked him or her to make Venn diagrams without touching anyone else’s cards. This necessitated participation by all group members and produced interesting results. In figure 6a, we see two sets with a clearly defined intersection (i.e., three overlapping sets of omnivores, herbivores, and carnivores). Figure 6b shows no intersection (i.e., three nonoverlapping sets of mammals, rodents, and birds). In the second adaptation, students were instructed to produce a Venn diagram silently.

107,Integrating Mathematics and Science: Ecology and Venn Diagrams,"GENERAL OUTCOMES Although the majority of the participants in the professional development workshop and the sixth-grade classroom focused on physical, biological, or behavioral characteristics of the animals, one group created a diagram that was dramatically different from that of the other groups. This group of professional development participants categorized the animals according to the symmetry observed in each  photograph (a connection between art and mathematics). This creative and unpredictable categorization was made possible by the open-ended nature of the problem posed. Although the focus of our session was on mathematics and science, this did not deter the last group from stepping outside the disciplinary boundaries and exploring other possibilities.",107,Integrating Mathematics and Science: Ecology and Venn Diagrams
108,Integrating Mathematics and Science: Ecology and Venn Diagrams,"This activity was particularly  important to implement in the sixthgrade classroom because it promotes group work and discussions. Through discussions of various possibilities, each group of students was able to reach consensus on the best way to categorize the animals. The groups had to divide the tasks required for the completion of the activity (sketch- ing, gluing, and organizing). At the end, students presented their group’s strategy to the other groups. In their presentations, students were able to communicate their ideas, justify their decisions, and address any questions the audience had. This skill is critical in both science (NGSS practice 7) and mathematics (CCSSM SMP 4), as we promote sense making in our students. Through the activity, students were encouraged to sort and justify, as they would have in a Venn diagram activity focused solely on mathematics (e.g., through representing polygons), but by using Venn diagrams to sort biological attributes, students applied a mathematical tool to a scientific context. In other words, they used mathematics to reinforce an understanding of science.  senting characteristics of sets. For example, one could use Venn diagrams to show relationships among polygons or real numbers. They are also important in introducing students to set theory. To extend this activity, one could discuss such topics as proper subsets (e.g., the set of people with dogs among those who have pets if at least one person has a pet other than a dog), nonproper subsets (e.g., the set of people with dogs among those who have pets if no one has a pet other than a dog), and disjoint sets (e.g., the set of people with a pet and the set of people with no pets). Thought-provoking questions can include the significance of the existence or nonexistence of a proper subset and the interpretation of a Venn diagram with no elements in the intersection.

110,Integrating Mathematics and Science: Ecology and Venn Diagrams,"Through this activity, we extended the use of Venn diagrams to the context of life sciences as a way of making connections between science and mathematics, and in particular, between the practices espoused by the NGSS and CCSSM. For example, through this activity, students classify, sort, and categorize objects based on their characteristics (CCSSM standard K.MD3 and 4.G.3) while considering habitats (NGSS standard 3LS4-3), interactions among organisms (MSLS2-2), and relationships between anatomy and function of organisms (MSLS4-2).

Other students (whether in groups or in a wholegroup discussion) can make conjectures about appropriate labels for the sets. Naturally, students would need to justify their conjectures to their peers and help them distinguish new characteristics of the animals. They would also engage in logical reasoning related to proof writing in mathematics using animal characteristics, which is a nice blend of mathematics and science.

117,Integrating Mathematics and Science: Ecology and Venn Diagrams,"However, although the use of mathematics as a “tool” for the learning of science is often acknowledged by teachers, the use of science to extend the understanding of mathematics is less common. This latter view is illustrated in the following comment made by a participating mathematics teacher: “I, of course, completely see math in the science classroom. . . . I don’t get how we’re going to bring science in here to help them [students] with their math.” This activity challenges this notion by having students use science to make sense of  mathematical terms. In this way, we blur the line between science and mathematics and encourage students to think outside disciplinary boundaries.
