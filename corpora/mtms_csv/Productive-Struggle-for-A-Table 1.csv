5,Productive Struggle for All: Differentiated Instruction,"Ms. Young is determined to engender flexible thinking in all her students. She identified and launched a mathematically rich task that could promote opportunities for productive struggle. As she observed discussions, she found that some students were not engaging in the task and were instead employing surface-level procedures that were not connected to the mathematics concepts. After class, she noted that although the task allowed for several solution pathways, the content was not accessible to all students. “I have tried differentiating tasks in the past by giving students part of the solution or even some sort of procedure, but this only seemed to remove students from reasoning about the mathematics. I know there is a better way.” How can Young differentiate instruction while keeping the task mathematically rich for  all students? wide range of learners while maintaining rigor. First, we provide an example of how well-meaning differentiation can sometimes decrease students’ ",5,Productive Struggle for All: Differentiated Instruction
6,Productive Struggle for All: Differentiated Instruction,"Mathematics teachers are challenged to daily engage all students, regardless of prior instructional experiences or current mathematical understandings, in rich mathematical content and practice. Teachers are expected to possess not only the knowledge for facilitating development of all students’ mathematical content knowledge but also the pedagogical skill to support the unique learning needs of all students. Even though differentiation is clearly needed to ensure that all students have access, it is not always clear how to differentiate in ways that maintain rigor. Often, attempts to increase accessibility can decrease the mathematical richness of the task. ",6,Productive Struggle for All: Differentiated Instruction

8,Productive Struggle for All: Differentiated Instruction,"Most teachers are familiar with the concept of differentiated instruction (DI) (Tomlinson 1999; Tomlinson and Imbeau 2010)—a process through which teachers can increase access to content by considering unique characteristics of students as they plan instructional experiences. DI identifies three ways to differentiate instruction, which includes modifications to— 1.  the content (i.e., what the student is  learning); 2.  the process (i.e., how the student  accesses the information or the way in which the student engages with the content); and 3.  the product (i.e., how students  demonstrate their knowledge or mastery of the content).

11,Productive Struggle for All: Differentiated Instruction,"Maintaining the cognitive demand and rigor of the mathematics task is essential for creating classrooms that  are more equitable. One essential component of equitable classrooms is providing all students with opportunities to engage in productive struggle. Although productive struggle is not a new concept in mathematics instruction, Principles to Actions: Mathematical Success for All (NCTM 2014) reemphasized its importance in learning mathematics. For students to learn mathematics meaningfully, it is necessary for them to struggle with concepts, procedures, and ideas (Hiebert and Grouws 2007). When all students are given opportunities to think critically about important mathematics content and concepts, they have higher achievement than their peers who are not afforded such opportunities (Marzano 2003). Unfortunately, when teaching students who have difficulties learning mathematics, especially those receiving special education services, the struggle is often removed (Karp 2013). ",11,Productive Struggle for All: Differentiated Instruction
12,Productive Struggle for All: Differentiated Instruction,Warshauer (2015) describes the  following strategies that teachers can use to support productive struggle: 1.  Ask purposeful questions to help  students reflect on the source of their struggle and focus their thinking.,12,Productive Struggle for All: Differentiated Instruction

20,Productive Struggle for All: Differentiated Instruction,"Aunt Martha has 5 trays of cupcakes. She describes how they were  arranged: There are 100 total  cupcakes on the trays. The first  and second trays have 52 cupcakes, the second and third trays have  43 cupcakes, the third and fourth trays have 34 cupcakes, and the fourth and fifth trays have 30 cupcakes. How many cupcakes are on each tray? (Bair and Mooney 2013, p. 326)",20,Productive Struggle for All: Differentiated Instruction
21,Productive Struggle for All: Differentiated Instruction,"Some students—particularly those  with disabilities—may lack some of the requisite prior knowledge to effectively engage with this problem. In considering how to differentiate this task, it may be tempting to provide these students with the total number of cupcakes that are on one of the trays. At face value, students would still participate in the task assigned to the class and would arrive at the same answer as their classmates. However, this fundamentally changes the task demands: By providing the number of cupcakes on one tray, the problem has become a series of subtraction problems. Because the student is no longer required to reason flexibly about composing and decomposing numbers, the student has fewer opportunities to engage in productive struggle.",21,Productive Struggle for All: Differentiated Instruction
22,Productive Struggle for All: Differentiated Instruction,"Several common issues can occur when differentiating a mathematical task. Watch for the following pitfalls when planning DI: •  Providing hints that remove the  cognitive demand of the task •  Focusing exclusively on the proce- dure, without a contextual emphasis, when helping the student generate the answer or solution •  Providing students with formulas (process) to solve a task without enabling them the opportunity to engage in the mathematics content •  Considering only the characteristics of students who struggle and not those of students working at above-grade-level expectations. Although avoiding these pitfalls is important, it does not suggest how one might approach meaningfully differentiating a task. To provide support for differentiating instruction in ways that increase opportunities for productive struggle, we have created an Accessible Practices Planning framework.",22,Productive Struggle for All: Differentiated Instruction

27,Productive Struggle for All: Differentiated Instruction,"These questions are appropriate for all students and need to be addressed at a whole class and individual level. Because a variety of student characteristics are found in inclusive classrooms, individual student considerations could differ greatly for the same task. For example, when identifying the barriers to engaging with the problem, the task’s context might be problematic for an ELL or a student with developmental delays, whereas a student with a physical disability may have challenges using physical manipulatives to represent the task. In contrast, students working above grade level may solve the problem quickly and need an extending question to truly engage with a cognitively demanding task that promotes productive struggle.",27,Productive Struggle for All: Differentiated Instruction

When solving contextual problems, Demetrios will work hard to find a solution if a personal connection exists, but when a disconnect is present between the task and his life experiences, he is less likely to put forth the needed  effort to truly engage in the task  and will do just enough to get by.  He works above grade-level expectations when performing mathematical calculations. Demetrios is an ELL who tends to be more engaged in tasks when he works with others to solve them. Young notes that barriers that Demetrios may experience include the ability to contextualize the task and frustration if he is asked to complete it independently. Given these characteristics, Demetrios might be most engaged when the context of the task is connected to Demetrios’s daily life experiences and he is asked to work with others in solving this task.",68,Productive Struggle for All: Differentiated Instruction
69,Productive Struggle for All: Differentiated Instruction,"In planning for differentiated instruction, Young’s first thought when considering this task for Demetrios is to use his life experiences as leverage to help him access the task content and connect it to his daily experiences.

She was considered learning disabled (LD) at the age of nine and is currently in the seventh grade. Recent assessments show that she is two grade levels behind in reading and  one grade level behind in mathematics. Jessica experiences difficulty with accessing word problems presented in a verbal format only because of auditory processing difficulties and problems focusing and maintaining her attention. These barriers often result in Jessica getting up and wandering around the room during mathematics class. When she is engaged in the lesson, Jessica often blurts out numerous “answers” to questions posed by the teacher and other classmates. For example, when Young launched the Cupcake problem the first time,  Jessica shouted out, “One hundred! Wait, . . . 100 divided by 5. Subtract the 52!” When she began to work on the problem, Jessica jotted a few numbers on her paper before she began to look around the room. When her classmate asked about her reasoning and the numbers she had written, Jessica threw her pencil on the floor and mumbled, “This is stupid.”",72,Productive Struggle for All: Differentiated Instruction

74,Productive Struggle for All: Differentiated Instruction,"Jessica might include asking supporting questions, supplying representations, allowing structured time for discussions, or posing questions that allow Jessica time to think and organize her thoughts before responding. For example, Young notes that Jessica would benefit from having verbal information presented side-by-side with a visual representation of the words or the mathematical situation. Moreover, a verbal launch of the situation may cause difficulty for Jessica in engaging in the discussion where the unpacking of the problem situation occurs. So, Young knows that, if verbal discussion is a part of the launch, Jessica might benefit from having “think time” included after each question is posed so that she can have time to process the verbal information being presented. Finally, presenting a “conceptual preview” of the problem situation with a similar problem (using visually presented, paired problem-solving  situations) may help maintain and focus Jessica’s attention during the larger problem.

75,Productive Struggle for All: Differentiated Instruction,"In considering all three of these  students’ diverse access needs, an opening discussion will clearly be the best way to start students off on this task. In the opening discussion, Young writes the problem on the board and covers the numbers in the Cupcake problem. To motivate Demetrios and help Carly (as well as other students) access the problem context, she draws 5 large trays and asks the class to think about what the problem is asking them, while encouraging them to connect the problem to their everyday life experiences. She makes sure to provide “think time” and use thinkpair-share strategies to help Jessica engage in the discussion and get the class talking about their understanding of the problem context. As she concludes the whole-class discussion, she hands out the problem. Because Carly would benefit from having a smaller number of cupcakes, Young has created a differentiated task that has a total of 15 cupcakes.

In addition to creating a classroom norm of students engaging in the mathematics (Warshauer 2015), we have proposed specific lesson-planning ideas, that are grounded in the tenets of DI, for maintaining productive struggle in an inclusive classroom: They include the following:  •  Consider the underlying   mathematical principles that are entailed in the problem;  •  Think about how each student can  gain access to the mathematical context of the task;  •  Consider how each student can  engage with the mathematics in a way that builds on and extends his or her prior knowledge;  •  Provide feedback in the form of  supporting or extending questions; •  Design structures or discussions to  help support student understanding; and  •  Provide ample time for each   student to engage in the mathematical content of the task.
