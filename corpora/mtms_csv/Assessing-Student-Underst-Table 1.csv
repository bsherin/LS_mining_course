0,Assessing Student Understanding - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In the current high-stakes testing environment, a mention of assessment is inevitably associated with large-scale summative assessments at the end of the school year. Although these assessments serve an important purpose, assessing students’ learning is an ongoing process that takes place in the classroom on a regular basis. Effectively gathering information about student understanding is integral to all aspects of mathematics instruction. Formative assessments conducted in the classroom have the potential to provide important feedback about students’ understanding, guide future instruction to improve student learning, and provide roadmaps for both teachers and students in the process of learning.",,
1,Assessing Student Understanding - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Ideas concerning formative assessment are discussed in the feature articles in this focus issue. A key point emphasized in all four articles is the teachers’ skill in noticing the mathematical thinking in student responses, organizing these responses to learn from them, and finally integrating this learning into instruction. In the article “Making Moves: Formative Assessment in Mathematics,” Brent Duckor, Carrie Holmberg, and Joanne Rossi Becker present a framework of seven practical moves that teachers can use to guide their instruction in the moment. The framework describes how all students, even those who may be less eager, can participate in higher-level mathematical thinking in the classroom. By becoming more strategic about the student responses in classroom interactions, teachers can use the framework as a guideline to help improve their instructional decision making over time. The authors advocate sharing the language of the framework with students, so that they can become aware of their role during classroom discussions.",,
2,Assessing Student Understanding - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In “Developing Assessment through Lesson Study,” Davida Fischman and Kelli Wasserman demonstrate that a teacher’s thinking around formative assessment extends before and after instruction in planning lessons and reflecting on lessons. This article highlights the importance of studying a carefully selected lesson very closely in an effort to enhance teachers’ abilities to formatively assess their students. We see that formative assessment is intertwined in the entire process of lesson development and that instructional decisions are driven by evidence of student thinking.",,
3,Assessing Student Understanding - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In “Monitoring Student Learningin Algebra,” Amy L. Accardo and S. Jay Kuder focus on formatively assessing student understanding of the mathematical concepts within an algebra class. The teachers monitor students’ learning by breaking algebra word problems into steps along a progression and designing assessment around these steps. By collecting student data, the teachers understand exactly where the students are challenged and thus are able to modify instruction accordingly. Further, learning opportunities are created as the teachers engage their students in identifying and fixing the errors that were observed.",,
4,Assessing Student Understanding - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The culminating article, “Empowering Mathematical Practices” by Jacqueline Coomes and Hyung Sook Lee, illustrates how formative assessment can play a role in assessing and enhancing students’ use of mathematical practices when solving problems. Coomes and Lee use a nonlinear function task as an example of how to engage all students in a meaningful task and then provide examples of specific feedback given to students based on the level of work. This feedback encourages each group of students to use a slightly more sophisticated reasoning strategy than they used in their first explanation.",,
5,Assessing Student Understanding - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Overall, the articles in this focus issue demonstrate the importance of the teacher asking the right questions to identify students’ mathematical thinking and thus make ongoing, critical decisions to improve instruction and enhance student learning. The articles also draw attention to equitable practices that encourage teachers to listen to the voices of each and every student in their classrooms.",,
6,Assessing Student Understanding - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Building and embedding these practices into classroom instruction can be challenging for all teachers. We hope that this set of articles will prompt you to reflect on your own formative assessment practices. We also hope that you discuss these ideas with colleagues and try some of the strategies presented.,,
