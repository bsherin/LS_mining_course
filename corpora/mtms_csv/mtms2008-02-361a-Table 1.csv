Using QUilt Blocks to constrUct ,0,mtms2008-02-361a,,
"Understanding aA quilting magazine’s thirteen-part  series titled “Taking the Mathematics Out” prompted the mathematics teacher and the quilter in me to think, “Say it isn’t so.” Give up the chance to use a four-patch quilt block to work with writing and plotting coordinate pairs and writing equations for lines? Not use nine-patch quilt blocks to look for examples of reflections, translations, rotations, and changes in scale? Never use quilt blocks to classify triangles and quadrilaterals, find perimeter and area, look for angle relationships, or practice with similar figures?  sue Westegaard, Sue_Westegaard@",1,mtms2008-02-361a,,

"Each time I construct a quilt block, I am struck by the myriad mathematical concepts that could be explored by using these blocks. When my quilting friends and I look for a simpler way to construct a block, to save fabric, or to find the finished size of a block, we are doing mathematics—filling scratch paper with fractions, making drawings (sometimes on graph paper), and using the Pythagorean theorem. A kit I had purchased to make a table runner included just the fabric and a picture of the finished product. The book that contained the pattern did not include anything else I wanted to sew. I was able, with my mathematical abilities, to create the pattern and easily figure out the cutting instructions. ",4,mtms2008-02-361a,,
"Last year, as my students and I  were reviewing the concept of area for a standardized test, my love of quilting took over our review. Our state requires students to pass an eighthgrade basic standards test. One question on the sample test showed three different squares with shaded regions and asked which square had the “most shaded” area. Included was an answer choice that all three squares had the same amount of shaded area. Without showing the students the question, I gave them instructions on how to draw each of the squares on their dot paper as shown in figure 1. For example, to draw figure 1a, students were given these instructions:  1.  Draw a horizontal line segment that is four units long; it should cover five dots on the dot paper.  2.  Draw a vertical line segment that  is four units long from the left end of the horizontal line. Draw a vertical line segment that is four units long from the right end of the horizontal line.  3.  Connect the endpoints of these  two vertical line segments to make a square.  4.  Find the midpoint of the top side of the square. Draw a line segment from this midpoint to the bottom-left corner of the square. Draw a line segment from the same midpoint to the bottom-right corner of the square.  5.  Shade the top-left triangle and the  top-right triangle. ",5,mtms2008-02-361a,,
"Students were asked to choose which figure has the most shaded region. The answer options were (a), (b), or (c) or that all three squares had the same amount of shaded area.",6,mtms2008-02-361a,,
"I asked each student to report his or her answers, which I tallied, then asked students to explain their reasoning. One student said that 1/2 of the area of figure 1a is shaded: “I can flip the right shaded triangle, then slide it to the left to fill half the square.” Another student used area formulas to find the areas of the shaded regions. Others counted full shaded units and then tried to put parts of them together to make full units. Students continued by explaining their reasoning for the areas of figures 1b and 1c. In figure 1b, a student said that the same number of squares are shaded and not shaded, so it is half shaded. For figure 1c, someone said to slide the left triangle to the right, then slide the whole thing to the right until it fills half the square. Listening to the students’ explanations for their answer choices really reinforced, for me, that students come to us with varying background information and approach problems in different ways. As students listened to their ",7,mtms2008-02-361a,,

"After I drew a few of these examples, my students took over and designed some questions of their own. Figure 2 shows a student-designed problem. This student asked his classmates to draw three squares that were four units on a side. For figure 2c, he gave directions similar to these:  1.  Start from the bottom-left corner. Go diagonally to the right to the first dot. Then go straight up to the next dot. Go right to the next dot. Go down to the next dot. Go right to the next dot. Then go down to the next dot. You should be back at the bottom of your square. Shade in the shape that you just drew.",12,mtms2008-02-361a,,
2.  Start at the top-right corner. Go diagonally to the left to the first dot. Then go down to the next dot. Go left to the next dot. Go up to the next dot. Go left to the next dot. Then go up to the next dot. You should be back at the top of  the square. Shade in the shape that you just drew.  3.  Compare it with your neighbor’s  shape. ,13,mtms2008-02-361a,,
"He did not think about the possibility of making just one of the shapes and then rotating it 180 degrees. For students who were not comfortable giving their own directions, they were asked to write their directions, which I would read. These students often gave their directions to one other person to make sure they made sense. Students noticed that they had to be very precise in their directions; they quickly found out that their step-bystep directions were easily misunderstood by their classmates.",14,mtms2008-02-361a,,
"I decided to make wall hangings  using some of my students’ designs. As shown in figure 3, the student started with a 5 × 5 grid. In figure 4, the design begins with a 4 × 4 grid, and each row is tied to a different problem. The third row in figure 4 contains the quilted version of my student’s design from figure 2a–c. They were proud to see their designs made into a wall hanging. ",15,mtms2008-02-361a,,

The area of the white squares is  what fraction of the entire block? ,21,mtms2008-02-361a,,
"At any time during this activity, students could be asked to generate their own questions and answers and write about their reasoning. They could also go to the Internet and download their own choice of a quilt block to use. ",22,mtms2008-02-361a,,
"Other nine-patch blocks, such as Linoleum (fig. 6) and Jacob’s Ladder (fig. 7), are more complicated and will increase the mathematical challenge for students when they are figuring the area of the different colors. ",23,mtms2008-02-361a,,

"Consider the Linoleum quilt block  with its white, blue, and yellow sections. In groups, my students made a similar block using white, blue, and yellow squares (2-inch squares work well) and yellow and white triangles (use isosceles right triangles with 2inch legs). It is important that students understand that they cannot tear, cut, or overlap any pieces. See figure 8 for a visual solution to finding the area of the different colors. Let the area of the entire linoleum quilt block be 81 square inches. Here are a few of the questions that my students generated. For each question, students were asked to write a solution or their reasoning.  1.  What is the length of one side of  the quilt block?  2.  What is the area of one small  white triangle?  3.

"She noticed that she could have chosen numbers for the side of the small white square that were not whole numbers. The Jacob’s Ladder block shown in figure 7 is a simple red and white design. Students were asked to write sentences about areas in the block (i.e., 1 red triangle is the same as 2 red squares). Students could also write their sentences using variables (i.e., if the area of a small red square is x, then the area of a red triangle is 2x). After this discussion, they could work on answering this question, “What fraction of the entire square is red? Justify your answer.”",35,mtms2008-02-361a,,

More QUilt designs,40,mtms2008-02-361a,,
"This article has discussed the use of only four different quilt-block patterns; many more designs can be found in books or on the Internet. Finding area is not the only task that can be completed with quilt blocks. The following ideas discuss other ways to make mathematical content connections using quilt blocks:  •  Transfer a quilt block to grid paper. Write a list of ordered pairs. Have students make connect-the-dots lists of ordered pairs to generate quilt blocks. Write equations for the line segments, along with restrictions. For example, the Thrifty Nine-Patch block can be drawn in  quadrant I of a coordinate grid so that the corners of the block are  at points (0, 0), (0, 9), (9, 9), and  (9, 0). The equation for one of  the line segments in the block  will be y = 3, with a restriction  of 0 ≤ x ≤ 9.  •  Construct a quilt block using a straightedge and compass or computer software, such as The Geometer’s Sketchpad or Cabri. •  Use relationships between supplementary and complementary angles and triangles to find the number of degrees in each angle of the quilt block.",41,mtms2008-02-361a,,
"•  Sort blocks into transformation  categories, such as those containing vertical and/or horizontal reflections or those that can be rotated 90 degrees or 180 degrees.",42,mtms2008-02-361a,,
"•  Identify types of triangles, quadrilaterals, and other shapes in the quilt block.  •  Use proportions to enlarge a quilt- block pattern to a specified size.",43,mtms2008-02-361a,,
"•  Have students make a quilt, either out of fabric or construction paper. ",44,mtms2008-02-361a,,
My hope is that readers will have fun with quilting and quilt blocks and that these ideas help generate more ways to use quilt blocks in the classroom. You do not have to be a quilter to find the mathematics in this traditional art form. ,45,mtms2008-02-361a,,
