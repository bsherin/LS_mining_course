"Math g  PKnowing both h occur between the mathematical expectations that students encounter in elementary school and middle school. Too often, the experiences that middle school students have in math do not connect to what they experience in elementary school. Although middle school teachers often have a sense of the content that students have learned in elementary school, the school structure and other factors can inhibit communication between elementary school and middle school teachers regarding how and what math that students have learned in elementary school.  and manner in which students learn math in elementary  school can help teachers bridge the gap between  the content ",1,mtms2010-03-400a,,
"J. Matt Switzer “Hi, I need your help!” exclaimed the person on the other end of the phone. Mary was a well-respected, veteran middle school mathematics teacher and department chair in our district. The sixth graders in her classes who had come from the local elementary schools for accelerated mathematics were using algorithms for computation that she had never seen. She needed help making sense of what her students were doing as well as deciding how to help them transition into secondary mathematics classes. I knew that if Mary had questions about these algorithms, then other teachers from our nine middle schools and four high schools would, as well.",2,mtms2010-03-400a,,

"Becoming acquainted with their students’  prior knowledge, in terms of both what and how they have learned, provides middle school teachers with the opportunity to better bridge the gap between elementary school math and high school math. I provide one example of how understanding the partial products algorithm taught in some elementary schools can bridge this gap. In this case, the focus is on the connections between what and how students learned mathematics in elementary school, and how teachers can use  this information to further students’ mathematical understanding.",5,mtms2010-03-400a,,
"I was in my first year as the K−12 math curriculum facilitator for a large school district after spending the previous fifteen years teaching middle school and high school math. Although I knew that the elementary school program used alternative algorithms, I did not know enough about them to explain them to our middle school and high school department chairs. The dialogue from the vignette initiated an eye-opening exploration into the world of computation and algebraic thinking. ",6,mtms2010-03-400a,,
"Having always taught above the elementary school level, I had never taught addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division with whole numbers. As with many teachers, I remembered spending countless hours with flashcards, timed tests, and activity sheets to learn and practice the traditional algorithms during elementary school. Learning acronyms to remember how to do long division and other forms of computation were also prominent elementary school memories. ",7,mtms2010-03-400a,,
"Our district-adopted elementary  math curriculum, Everyday Mathematics (UCSMP 2002a) introduced computation differently from what I had experienced as a student. As a result, I knew that in my new role as a K−12 math curriculum facilitator I had to learn about the computational approaches at the elementary level to support not only the thirty elementary school teachers but also the middle school and high school math teachers. Mary’s request for help was a good  place to start. I checked the Teacher’s Reference Manual to find how the materials introduced these “basic skills” in elementary school classrooms. For each operation, several alternative algorithms to the traditional algorithm were provided, but a single-focus algorithm was designated as “powerful, relatively efficient, and easy to understand and learn” (UCSMP 2002b).  what is an alternative algorithM?",8,mtms2010-03-400a,,
"The effective use of alternative algorithms can help students develop a strong conceptual understanding of operation, number, and place value that are often masked by the use of traditional algorithms. Moreover, if students become proficient in the use of alternative algorithms and develop a strong conceptual understanding of why they work, their transition to the use of the more efficient traditional algorithms should be easier. ",9,mtms2010-03-400a,,
"Instead of “beginning mathematics  instruction by focusing solely on computational algorithms, such as addition and subtraction, students  are encouraged to invent their own strategies for solving problems and  to discuss why those strategies work” (Bransford, Brown, and Cocking 2000, p. 159). When taught for understanding, these algorithms can provide connections among mathematical ideas that help students reason mathematically. Learning with understanding can help students better apply ideas to numbers beyond whole numbers and provide connections to the algebraic reasoning they will do in future math classes.",10,mtms2010-03-400a,,
"Although being able to follow an  algorithm is an important process in mathematics, conceptual understanding of these processes is also important. As Marilyn Burns notes, students  need to develop a sense of number that enables them to recognize relationships between quantities; to use the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to obtain numerical information; to understand how the operations are related to one another; to be able to approximate and estimate when appropriate; and to be able to apply their understandings to problem situations.

The use of alternative algorithms can help students develop the types of understanding needed to accomplish these mathematical goals.  why is it iMPortant to know these algorithMs?,14,mtms2010-03-400a,,
"Effective teaching requires building on students’ prior knowledge (Donovan and Bransford 2005). Middle school teachers, such as Mary, will encounter students who use multiple algorithms. They need to understand these algorithms so that they can build on what students know as they transition into computation involving decimals and algebraic expressions and equations. Therefore, being familiar with, and understanding, these algorithms are important first steps in the process. ",15,mtms2010-03-400a,,
"To support Mary’s inquiry, we decided to discuss our elementary school program’s use of alternative algorithms at a middle school−senior high school math department chair meeting. At the first meeting, we identified, ",16,mtms2010-03-400a,,

"explored, and discussed the algorithms that our students were bringing to the middle school classroom. ",18,mtms2010-03-400a,,
"We began by looking at the partial-products algorithm (see  fig. 1). Partial products, or the expanded algorithm for multidigit multiplication (Kilpatrick, Swafford, and Findell 2001), is the focus algorithm for multiplication in the Everyday Mathematics curriculum and closely aligns with the process that many adults use when doing mental math. When using the partial-products  algorithm, students consider factors as sums of ones, tens, hundreds and so  on. Therefore, for the problem shown in figure 2, students considered 47 as (40 + 7) and 23 as (20 + 3). Each part of one factor is multiplied by the parts of the other factor, producing a series of “partial products” that are then added to get the final product.",19,mtms2010-03-400a,,
"After demonstrating the partialproducts algorithm, two responses arose from department chairs. One group did not understand why we would want the students to use this method, since the traditional algorithm was more efficient. However, the other group recognized the math that was inherent in the partial-sums   algorithm. Tom said, “That’s cool. They are using distribution.” The connection between the distributive property of multiplication over addition and partial products may not be obvious because of the vertical structure of the problem in figure 1a. However, if the problem is rewritten horizontally (see fig. 1b), as generally done in secondary classrooms and especially in many algebra classes, and if the factors are written in expanded form, the connection becomes much clearer.",20,mtms2010-03-400a,,
"Another way to demonstrate the  connection between the partial-  products algorithm and the distributive property of multiplication is by using algebra tiles. Figure 2’s arrangement of algebra tiles represents the multiplication of binomials  (2x + 3)(4x + 7). Teachers and students can model the partial-products algorithm in a similar manner. By changing the x-tiles to 10-tiles, and subsequently changing the x2-tiles to 100-tiles, we can model each of the four partial products for 23 × 47 geometrically. (The side-by-  side comparison is evident in fig. 2.)",21,mtms2010-03-400a,,
"This model can also be a foundation  on which to build the more abstract area model for (2x + 3)(4x + 7). Again, knowing both what our students learned in elementary school and how they learned it can provide opportunities to design instruction that builds on their prior knowledge and bridges the gap between elementary and secondary mathematics.",22,mtms2010-03-400a,,
Partial ProdUcts in the eleMentary school,23,mtms2010-03-400a,,
"Tom recognized a critical connection for all middle school and high school teachers: the connection between the ways that our elementary students learned math and the implications that it has for the math being taught by their teachers. These teachers viewed the distributive property of multiplication over addition as a “new” topic for their students. However, Tom’s recognition of the distributive property of multiplication over addition in the partial-products algorithm stimulated a rich discussion. Teachers saw how their awareness of this idea gives them a connection between their students’ prior knowledge of partial products and the distributive property. We began to develop a deeper understanding and appreciation for how students in our elementary schools were engaging in and learning mathematics. ",24,mtms2010-03-400a,,
"Our elementary school students  knew how to do the distributive property of multiplication over addition, even though they had never heard the term. They had developed an algorithm for multiplication that preserved place value, allowed them to develop a conceptual understanding of the operation, and introduced them to distribution. The department chairs noticed that when students work with the partialproducts algorithm, they do not regard each digit as a single digit, as occurs when using the traditional algorithm. For example, students treat the 4  in 47 as 40 in the partial-products algorithm instead of as a 4 in the traditional algorithm, potentially masking the importance of place value. Through our discussions, we realized the connections that partial products make across number, place value, computation, and distribution. This discussion revealed an example of one aspect of a coherent curriculum that “effectively organizes and integrates important mathematical ideas so that students can see how the ideas build on, or connect with, other ideas, thus enabling them to develop new understandings and skills” (NCTM 2000, p. 15).",25,mtms2010-03-400a,,
"In addition to the connections  between the partial-products and the distributive property of multiplication over addition, we also discussed how these algorithms promoted a stronger sense of place value. For students using these alternative algorithms, place value was more than simply naming the location of the digits (i.e., the hundreds place is two spaces to the right of the decimal). Instead, they have the opportunity to become efficient at composing and decomposing numbers and to recognize that each digit in a number represents a quantity. ",26,mtms2010-03-400a,,
"For example, while working with elementary school and middle school preservice teachers, I have asked them to compute 23 × 47, in which 23 is the multiplier. After they have presented their solutions, I ask why the 1 is recorded above the tens place for 2 × 7,  which is really 20 × 7, or 140, since the 1 is actually 100. These students have found it troubling that they cannot answer this question for an algorithm that they felt they understood.",27,mtms2010-03-400a,,
"Thus, the department chairs in our school district recognized that making explicit connections between partial products and the mathematics taught in middle school and senior high school can be a powerful bridge. Traditionally, instruction on the distributive property of multiplication over addition begins with multiplying a monomial by a binomial, using the monomial as the multiplier. Unfortunately, once we move beyond these initial expressions, and students use shortcuts such as FOIL (First Outer Inner Last), they often lose the connection to the distributive property of multiplication over addition. Approximately half my precalculus classes thought that they did not know how to multiply a binomial by a trinomial, because they were unable to apply FOIL to this situation. ",28,mtms2010-03-400a,,
"The key is to help students make  connections to their previous work so that they recognize that they have already used the distributive property. Revisiting partial products and helping them see the connection to what we are asking them to do in secondary mathematics classrooms can make the job of teaching easier. It can also show students that math is more than a multitude of discrete, unrelated facts. By examining students’ prior knowledge, we became aware of an opportunity to bridge the gap between our students’ experiences in elementary school math and secondary math.  conclUsion Partial products is one example of how making connections between students’ prior mathematical experiences in elementary school can help secondary teachers give students opportunities to build on their prior knowledge  in powerful ways. Although we examined only a single algorithm in this article, we recognize that other algorithms and ideas are also worthy of further examination. ",29,mtms2010-03-400a,,
"Math coordinators, coaches, and  lead teachers can use discussions about alternative algorithms, or other topics, as a way to encourage elementary school and middle school teachers to work together to facilitate coherent, connected learning opportunities for students. In addition to alternative algorithms, other aspects of the elementary math program in your school or district can provide powerful connections for you and your students. ",30,mtms2010-03-400a,,
"A key to promoting such teacher- to-teacher communication is to deepen our own understanding of these connections. Discussions among middle school and senior high math  teachers, elementary teachers, principals, and district mathematics coordinators can better prepare students to develop a deep understanding of mathematical ideas throughout their K−12 school experience.",31,mtms2010-03-400a,,
