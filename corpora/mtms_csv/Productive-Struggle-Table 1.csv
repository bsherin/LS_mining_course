34,Productive Struggle,"Productive Struggle fFrom a teaching perspective, witnessing  students struggle mathematically can be distressing because all teachers want their students to be successful. However, this struggle can ultimately lead to success when the teacher facilitates learning in the classroom in a manner that allows for think-time, teacher and student questioning, and collaboration. The act of struggling productively, as outlined in the following four articles, shows examples of how students are able to take ownership of mathematical understanding through this struggling process and ultimately have a lasting understanding because of the adversity. The articles also highlight steps that teachers need to take to ensure that this struggle is in fact productive and not arduous. Productive struggle in the classroom is equal parts teacher and student; when each role is clearly defined and enacted, students have a deeper understanding of mathematics and feel a sense of accomplishment that the understanding is in fact their own.",34,Productive Struggle
35,Productive Struggle,"“Productive Struggle for All: Differentiated Instruction,” written by Sararose D. Lynch, Jessica H. Hunt, and Katherine E. Lewis, examines the challenges of implementing differentiated instruction in a manner that does not lower the cognitive demand of the task. One central premise of this article is that productive struggle is an issue of equity. Each and every student in the classroom deserves the opportunity to think deeply about mathematical ideas, and efforts to differentiate tasks could inadvertently take that opportunity away. The article provides a useful planning framework for teachers to reflect on as they think about differentiating tasks and includes three insightful cases that highlight these practices in action.",35,Productive Struggle
36,Productive Struggle,"“Scaffolding for Access to Productive Struggle,” written by Angela T. Barlow, Natasha E. Gerstenschlager, Jeremy F. Strayer, Alyson E. Lischka, D. Christopher Stephens, Kristin S. Hartland, and J. Christopher  Willingham, provides three specific scaffolds that teachers can employ with their students to support productive struggle. The authors connect the student work to that of scaffolding for learning. The authors cite Wood, Bruner, and Ross (1976), who provided six scaffolds that might be employed with students. The article provides specific and practical principles for action with regard to engaging students in productive struggle. The authors also implicitly address the need for quality tasks while providing insight into how the tasks can be implemented to maintain high levels of cognitive demand while allowing for “access to productive struggle.” “Seven Billion People: Fostering ",36,Productive Struggle
37,Productive Struggle,"Productive Struggle,” written by Jaclyn M. Murawska, describes the experiences of preservice teachers encountering productive struggle firsthand from a student point of view. The author discusses what teachers should do to prepare for a task to aid students in struggling productively. Anticipating common pitfalls and having some general questions prepared in advance will make the classroom portion go more smoothly, as nearly all the preservice teachers (acting as middle school students) expressed anxiety at various points during the task. The task described would be exciting for middle school students, and the sheer number of answers produced in this example leads to a great discussion.",37,Productive Struggle
38,Productive Struggle,"“Supporting All Learners in  Productive Struggle,” written by ",38,Productive Struggle
39,Productive Struggle,"Cynthia Townsend, David Slavit, and Amy Roth McDuffie, showcases the experience of a teacher implementing two nonroutine tasks and the shifts in the teaching practice that were made to purposefully support students’ productive struggle. The authors introduce four key elements that were useful in providing that support:  1. Task scaffolding 2. Peer support 3. Teacher motivation 4. A reassuring classroom environment",39,Productive Struggle
40,Productive Struggle,The article does an excellent job of providing specific examples of these practices in action in the context of the two problems that were being solved.,40,Productive Struggle

Whether it be planning prior to the lesson, selecting and implementing a specific task, questioning strategies, or discussing decision making during a task to scaffold the learning and support productive struggle, teachers play a vital role as they support their students’ in meaningful learning experiences through productive struggle. ",42,Productive Struggle
43,Productive Struggle,It can be difficult to realize productive struggle for each and every student. We hope that this set of articles will assist you in reflecting on your practice and considering actions that you can take in facilitating productive struggle for your students. We also hope that you will discuss the ideas with colleagues and look for opportunities to support one another in this important work.,43,Productive Struggle
