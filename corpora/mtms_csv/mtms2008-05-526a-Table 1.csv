Chalking Up Success:  An Exam-Review  Strategy,2,mtms2008-05-526a,,
"Most teachers have been in this situation: Only one week remains before final exams, and the weather outside is warm and sunny. The students are feeling the fatigue that comes with nine months of sustained learning, and teachers are focusing on getting through the next weeks of instruction and end-ofschool paperwork. All this considered, the question remains: How do we get students actively engaged in the learning process while balancing fatigue and warmer weather? The wondrous world of sidewalk chalk might be part of the solution.",3,mtms2008-05-526a,,

"To introduce the lesson, distribute a concept overview sheet (see fig. 1) to the students and ask them to consider the topics on it. This gives the class an opportunity to brainstorm alternative ways to review these important topics.",5,mtms2008-05-526a,,

"Let the students know that you will take them outside and that they  will be doing some mathematics on the pavement close to the school. They will be working in groups of two or three, and each team will be responsible for a topic on the conceptoverview sheet. They will be using sidewalk chalk to create questions, diagram answers, and give instruction. Each group will have thirty minutes to create its mathematical art, then the class will get together so that the groups can present the reviews of their topics. Teachers may find it beneficial to allow students to brainstorm their questions and sidewalk-chalk design in one class, then complete their mathematics artwork on the sidewalk the next time class meets.",7,mtms2008-05-526a,,

"Assign an area of pavement to each group. There are few boundaries, except that students are expected to work on mathematics and be ready to present in thirty minutes. When all the artists have finished their masterpieces, you and the class ",9,mtms2008-05-526a,,

"Students take the concept-overview sheet home and complete an example from each of the eighteen sections. They are responsible for creating their own questions or adapting questions from previous work. The assessment of their homework is based on whether a question itself is at or above the expected grade level and whether the solution explanation is correct. If students have been listening to each group’s presentations, this will be an easy task.  conclusion",14,mtms2008-05-526a,,
Grabbing a bucket of sidewalk chalk and telling students that they can go outdoors are ways to jump-start their mathematical thought processes. The first good soaking rain will clean up any mathematical errors they might make. ●,15,mtms2008-05-526a,,
