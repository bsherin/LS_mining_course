7,A Closer Look at Manipulatives in Remediation,"In looking for an area of student improvement for my action research proposal, I examined my middle school’s standardized test scores for the previous fi ve years. Student performance on fractions was consistently the lowest of all concepts from grades 5–8. Consistent with research, students often struggle with a conceptual understanding of fractions (Cramer, Post, and delMas 2002; Moss and Case 1999; Kastberg and Norton 2007). Many ",7,A Closer Look at Manipulatives in Remediation
8,A Closer Look at Manipulatives in Remediation,"The Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSI 2010) placed the bulk of fraction instruction in grades 3 through 7. In considering how to remediate my students’ lack of conceptual understanding of fractions, an NCTM statement came to mind: “Representing ideas and connecting the representations to mathematics lies at the heart of understanding mathematics” (NCTM 2000, p. 136). As an eighth-grade prealgebra teacher  times, students are taught procedural algorithms without the conceptual meaning necessary to understand the connection between algorithms involving fractions and the meaning behind them (Hiebert and Carpenter 1992; NCTM 2000). Research has shown that using manipulatives may be a viable option for remediation (Green, Piel, and Flowers 2008).",8,A Closer Look at Manipulatives in Remediation

10,A Closer Look at Manipulatives in Remediation,"Based on a review of literature on manipulatives and patterns of misconceptions in student work that I have seen over the years, I designed a unit of instruction using concrete and virtual manipulatives. Concepts in the unit included fraction equivalences/ relationships, ordering fractions, and  dividing and multiplying fractions in context. Throughout the unit, we used a variety of concrete as well as virtual manipulatives. For some concepts, we used both. ",10,A Closer Look at Manipulatives in Remediation
11,A Closer Look at Manipulatives in Remediation,"During these lessons, I looked at  various ways to convey topics based on research. When using manipulatives, it is important for the teacher to focus on student learning (Moyer 2001). My lessons were structured so that students had opportunities to make realizations from using manipulatives. Hiebert and Carpenter (1992) stated that “an important variable to consider is the explicitness with which the connections are drawn for students between features of the materials and symbolic representations”  (p. 88). Therefore, I emphasized linking the model to the procedures, so that learning became a network of information (Hiebert 1986). Throughout the unit, I wanted students to experience cognitive dissonance, also known as perturbation (von Glasersfeld 1995). The goal was for students to recognize and replace faulty thinking, so I purposefully created an environment in which students questioned their previously held beliefs.",11,A Closer Look at Manipulatives in Remediation
12,A Closer Look at Manipulatives in Remediation,"Classroom norms for this unit were  similar to those followed during the year. As they presented and justified their solutions to the class, students were encouraged to discuss activities by questioning and critiquing one another’s thinking. The student grouping changed, depending on the type of manipulative itself; groups of four used concrete manipulatives, and pairs used virtual manipulatives. All groups and pairs were in mixed-ability levels. The following results and discussion are limited to 40 of the 125 students who returned permission forms.",12,A Closer Look at Manipulatives in Remediation

14,A Closer Look at Manipulatives in Remediation,"Beginning the unit with fraction equivalence was important because of  its connection to proportional reasoning, a pivotal concept that Lesh, Post, and Behr argued is “the cornerstone of all that is to follow” (1988, pp. 93–94). For this concept, we used both concrete and virtual manipulatives. ",14,A Closer Look at Manipulatives in Remediation

17,A Closer Look at Manipulatives in Remediation,"We used the Equivalent Fractions  applet from Illuminations (http:// illuminations.nctm.org/Activity Detail.aspx?ID=80), which allowed students to virtually create equivalent fractions shown as a measurement model (depicted by locations on a number line) and as region models. The activity required students to generate two fractions that were equivalent to the one example given. Some students told me that they generated equivalent fractions by mentally obtaining a common denominator, whereas other students experimented until they found equivalent fractions. After the applet activity, we used a Cuisenaire® Rod activity, also on the Illuminations site, called Investigating Fraction Relationships with Relationship Rods (http://illuminations.nctm .org/LessonDetail.aspx?ID=L542). In this example, students determined the value of each rod compared with a rod designated as 1. Many students stated that working with the Cuisenaire Rods helped them visualize fractions better. Robert (all names are pseudonyms), who had difficulty seeing a shorter rod as a whole, shared that doing this activity helped him know that an improper fraction is greater ",17,A Closer Look at Manipulatives in Remediation

20,A Closer Look at Manipulatives in Remediation,"As students worked through this activity, they had difficulty keeping a fixed referent. For example, the light-green rod is 1 1/2 units when the red is the referent whole. However, students gave the answer “1 1/3.” The error in the answer 1 1/3 is that the extra unit fraction was compared with the light-green rod instead of the red rod, which was the fixed whole (see fig. 1). After using Cuisenaire Rods as a length model, we used pattern blocks as region models so that students could continue examining fractional relationships.",20,A Closer Look at Manipulatives in Remediation
21,A Closer Look at Manipulatives in Remediation,"We used traditional pattern blocks  (trapezoid, rhombus, equilateral triangle, and hexagon) and two relatively new pattern blocks (a scalene right triangle and a right trapezoid) that represented 1/12 and 1/4 hexagon. Similar to the Cuisenaire Rod activity, students tended to switch referents when determining the fractional relationships. For example, when the right trapezoid is “1,” the rhombus is 1 1/3. Students said the rhombus was 1 1/4 because they compared the extra unit fraction (a right scalene triangle) with the rhombus instead of the referent whole (see fig. 2). On the posttest, 42.5 percent of students were able to correctly partition the rectangle into fifths, as well as generate an equivalent fraction.",21,A Closer Look at Manipulatives in Remediation

The fractions generated on the applet were each labeled as a unit fraction and were shaded a different color (see fig. 3). During class discussion, we addressed the fact that 1/2 is the largest unit fraction; however, it is not always the largest fraction in general. The virtual manipulative illustrated this point quickly and precisely. On the posttest, approximately 63 percent of students ",30,A Closer Look at Manipulatives in Remediation

32,A Closer Look at Manipulatives in Remediation,"Each year in eighth-grade prealgebra, I had to reteach division of fractions. Most students had been taught the traditional algorithm but could not reproduce it or explain how it worked. Further, students had the misconception that division by any number produces a smaller quotient than the dividend. ",32,A Closer Look at Manipulatives in Remediation

Students were asked to model and solve this problem:   Rachel has 4 bottles of Coke®.  She is going to give each friend  2/3 of a bottle to drink. How  many friends can she share with? ,38,A Closer Look at Manipulatives in Remediation
39,A Closer Look at Manipulatives in Remediation,"Most students created 4 bars (each 1 unit long) to represent the Cokes and created bars of length 2/3 to represent the servings. Some students created  1 bar that was 4 units long instead (see fig. 4). Many students were able to determine that the answer was “Rachel can share with 6 friends.” The difficulty arose when students were asked to determine which operation was appropriate. Many students stated that the correct operation was multiplication  because their answer was larger. For the sake of discussion, we multiplied and did not get an answer of “6.” Students replied that they did not think it was division because they thought division would produce a smaller answer. Then, we used the conventional division algorithm and found the correct answer of 6. I questioned students as to why the conventional algorithm of “multiplying by the reciprocal” (of the divisor) was procedurally correct and where it was evident in the manipulative. After everyone had time to think, one student articulated that each Coke provided 1 1/2 servings, which equated to 3/2 servings per Coke.",39,A Closer Look at Manipulatives in Remediation
40,A Closer Look at Manipulatives in Remediation,"To incorporate multiple manipulative models for division, we used pattern blocks. One of our problems was 5 ÷ 3/4. The majority of students used hexagons as the whole and right trapezoids as fourths. Other students used rhombi as the whole and right scalene triangles as fourths (see fig. 5).",40,A Closer Look at Manipulatives in Remediation
41,A Closer Look at Manipulatives in Remediation,"During this activity, students had  difficulty determining the remainder. Although the answer was 6 2/3, some students stated that it was 6 2/4 because they considered the two right trapezoids (or right scalene triangles) that remained to be fourths of the whole instead of thirds of the divisor. Prior context helped in this situation because we had established that 3/4 was 1 serving. Therefore, if 2/4 remained, we needed to determine what fraction of a serving remained. That is, 2/4 was 2/3 of 3/4. During class discussions, we used precise language by stating, “You have 2 of the necessary 3 pieces to make a ‘serving.’ ”  The pattern blocks were a helpful tool to use in that students could see this relationship concretely. On the posttest, 17.5 percent of students answered correctly, and an additional 17.5 percent of students answered either “5 servings” or “5 1/8 servings.” Only 2 students used the division algorithm; all others used a visual model.",41,A Closer Look at Manipulatives in Remediation

43,A Closer Look at Manipulatives in Remediation,"In previous years, some students had the misconception that multiplying created a larger product, regardless of the multiplier and multiplicand.

45,A Closer Look at Manipulatives in Remediation,"Students were asked to solve the  problem and identify which operation was used to solve it. Only 10 percent of students correctly multiplied 5/6 × 24, and one student divided by 6 and then multiplied by 5. ",45,A Closer Look at Manipulatives in Remediation
46,A Closer Look at Manipulatives in Remediation,"Before introducing multiplying  by fractions, students played a game  called Concentration (at http:// illuminations.nctm.org/Activity -Detail.aspx?ID=73) to review their prior knowledge of percent-fraction equivalence. I wanted to connect multiplying by fractions to using percentages in computation to strengthen their knowledge of percentage and its connection to fractions. The following day, I gave students this problem:  Steven used 60 percent of his  paper during his math class. If  he had 30 sheets of paper, how many did he use during math?",46,A Closer Look at Manipulatives in Remediation

48,A Closer Look at Manipulatives in Remediation,"Students were not instructed on how to use the dot paper because I wanted them to show their inventive ability. Students created rectangles of dimensions 6 × 5, 2 × 15, or 3 × 10. Because we reviewed percentages, many students converted 60 percent to 3/5 or 6/10, colored a proportionally equivalent amount, and answered correctly that “Steven used 18 sheets.” We used fraction multiplication and discussed in depth how cross-simplifying was evident in our model (see fig. 6). For example, when we divided 30 by 5, we said that we were actually calculating 1/5 of 30 and then multiplying by 3 to find out how much 3/5 of 30 was. One group modeled that procedure well by creating a 1 × 5 rectangle; shading 3 squares, which indicated that each square had a value of 6; and stating that the answer was “18” (see fig. 7). These models supported our discussion that multiplying by a fraction meant that you were determining a portion of a total.",48,A Closer Look at Manipulatives in Remediation

56,A Closer Look at Manipulatives in Remediation,"Conceptual understanding and procedural fluency of fraction concepts is necessary for students to become mathematically proficient. By focusing on conceptual understanding and requiring procedural fluency, I prepared my students to begin learning the standards in our eighth-grade curriculum. When the standards were extensions of these fraction concepts (e.g., similar figures, equations with fractional coefficients, and linear functions), we spent minimal time revisiting fraction procedures, which saved time in the long run. ",56,A Closer Look at Manipulatives in Remediation
57,A Closer Look at Manipulatives in Remediation,"Because of the positive results from  the project, we continued incorporating concrete and virtual manipulatives into regular instruction throughout the year and focusing on critical thinking skills as we covered our standards. Students’ attitudes toward math continued to improve; their ability  to communicate their understanding improved; and, subsequently, they were able to build on the knowledge they gained during this unit. Kelly’s postsurvey comment was a testament: “I love the hands on! I always understand better when we do hands on.” Jared’s postsurvey comment communicated his preference for virtual manipulatives: “I loved the computer stuff. It made math fun. I understand it a lot.” Ryan’s comment was also confirmation that the manipulatives made a difference: “I can now see a mental model, too; before I was just seeing numbers.”",57,A Closer Look at Manipulatives in Remediation
58,A Closer Look at Manipulatives in Remediation,"Students had positive reactions to  both types of manipulatives, so I would use both again. However, I realized limitations while using one virtual manipulative. For the pattern blocks division, we attempted to use the virtual pattern blocks at the NLVM. When students overlaid the virtual pattern blocks, the pattern block on the bottom was no longer visible as it had been with the concrete blocks. Also, the website did not contain right trapezoids or right scalene triangles, which limited the unit fractions we used. With concrete manipulatives, one difficulty that students experienced while  using Cuisenaire Rods was keeping a fixed referent whole when working with fractions greater than 1. Using both concrete and virtual manipulatives helped me recognize the importance of knowing which manipulatives were useful with particular concepts, as well as the limitations.",58,A Closer Look at Manipulatives in Remediation
59,A Closer Look at Manipulatives in Remediation,"Each year, I have tried to improve  the methods of instruction to meet students’ needs. I have not always given a pretest before teaching the concepts; however, conducting this action research helped reveal the importance of pretests and what information can be obtained from them. Knowing students’ misconceptions helped me to plan instruction, so that those misconceptions could be addressed. Seeing students’ enthusiasm for learning gave me encouragement to continue improving my methods of instruction using manipulatives. ",59,A Closer Look at Manipulatives in Remediation
