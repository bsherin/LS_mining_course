1,Soccer Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"A soccer field, also known as a soccer
  pitch

  , is composed of rectangular and circular shapes. Not all pitches are the same size. A pitch measuring 100 yd. Ã— 50 yd. has the smallest permissible dimensions.",,
2,Soccer Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
3,Soccer Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,1. What is the total distance covered by a soccer player who runs diagonally across a 100 yd. Ã— 50 yd. pitch from one corner to the other?,,
4,Soccer Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,2. A player runs in a line from the center circle to a corner of the pitch. What total distance has the player run? How does this distance compare with your calculation (in question 1) of the total distance of the diagonal line-segment length of the pitch?,,
5,Soccer Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"3. A soccer coach requires that the team warm up by jogging the perimeter of the field before every game. If the team jogs two laps around the perimeter, what is total distance that each player runs?",,
6,Soccer Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"4. The ""18 yard box,"" also known as the 
  penalty area,

  is the only part of the field in which the goalkeeper can use his or her hands to move the ball. The dimensions of this rectangle are 18 yd. Ã— 44 yd. What is the area of this rectangle? Is this box similar to the entire field? Why or why not?",,
7,Soccer Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"5. Inside the 18 yard box is a smaller region called the ""6 yard box"" with dimensions of 6 yd. Ã— 20 yd. Find the area of the 6 yard box. Is it similar to the 18 yard box? Explain. Approximately how many times larger is the area of the 18 yard box than the area of the 6 yard box?",,
8,Soccer Math - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"6. International matches are played on a pitch that is at least 70 yd. Ã— 110 yd. Many U.S. youth soccer leagues, however, use smaller dimensions for their fields. If a youth soccer pitch measures 30 yards along its short side (goal line), what length does the long side (touch line) have to be so that the field is proportional to the 50 yd. Ã— 100 yd. pitch dimensions?",,
