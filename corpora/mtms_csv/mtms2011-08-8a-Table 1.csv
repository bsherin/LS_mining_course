The Process of Abstracting  in Students’ Representations,1,mtms2011-08-8a,,
"Despina A. Stylianou sentations typically varies among students, representation also varies within the work of each student. Representation, then, becomes a personally meaningful activity for each student, central to his or her problem solving and construction of meaning. Researchers have highlighted how students’ representations evolve from concrete to abstract during mathematical activity (see Gravemeijer et al. 2002). Students draw from their earlier applications of representations by using them as tools for thinking. For teachers, attention to the evolution of representation in each student’s work opens a window to all students developing problem-solving processes and mathematical reasoning. ",2,mtms2011-08-8a,,
MatheMatizing and RepResenting,3,mtms2011-08-8a,,
"Fosnot and Dolk (2002) describe the process of mathematizing by contrasting a “traditional approach to teaching mathematics” with the work of mathematicians. Of mathematicians, they write that “at the heart of mathematics is the process of setting up relationships mathematically in order to communicate them to others”  (p. 8). Central to this is the process of representing. Mathematicians represent problem situations and use these representations as devices in advancing their own understanding and communicating their thinking to their peers. Similarly, as students explore problem contexts, they create representations as part of processing and exploring ",4,mtms2011-08-8a,,
"Representation lies at the heart of doing mathematics. It is the activity of creating and using mathematical symbols, signs, and diagrams. NCTM (2000) advocates that students be fluent users of representations and that instruction should support students in learning to navigate mathematical concepts and problem solving through the use of a variety of representations.",5,mtms2011-08-8a,,
"Representation is often understood to be a product—a static picture or set of symbols. These static representations or products are often used to aid instruction or illustrate a mathematical idea. However, representation is also a process—the path that one follows while developing mathematical understanding. Diagrams and symbolism evolve dynamically during problem solving, assuming different roles and providing insights into this process.",6,mtms2011-08-8a,,

"Let us join a sixth-grade classroom  in which students were beginning to study algebraic concepts and were offered a “cognitively demanding task” (Smith and Stein 1998). This task required that students explore and understand the nature of mathematical concepts, without being offered representations, algorithms, or worked-out examples up front. Such tasks naturally allow for a variety of approaches to emerge. The Party problem was used to start this unit: ",9,mtms2011-08-8a,,
"We plan on having a party to celebrate the upcoming elections. We want to sit with our friends and watch the results as they are announced on TV. A party rental company will bring several small square tables (each side fits one person) that we will put together to form one long table. How many people can we invite to our party if we rent several such tables? idea to combine tables, considering that some seats would disappear? How many seats would be eliminated?",10,mtms2011-08-8a,,
"Gareth: But if you said that it eliminates one, then it’s gonna…",11,mtms2011-08-8a,,
"Ellen: Exactly, ’cause, because if it  eliminates . . . ",12,mtms2011-08-8a,,
"Gareth: No, it actually eliminates two, doesn’t it, because you got one, two, three, four, five, six, and there’s supposed to be seven, and eight. ",13,mtms2011-08-8a,,
Ellen: So you draw one table; you put  each person on each side.,14,mtms2011-08-8a,,
Gareth: Yeah.,15,mtms2011-08-8a,,
"Ellen: Then, you, you, uh . . . .",16,mtms2011-08-8a,,
Gareth: You add another table.,17,mtms2011-08-8a,,
"Ellen: Yeah, you add another table, and  then you put each person on each side and . . . ",18,mtms2011-08-8a,,
"Gareth: But, you know, you have to  eliminate that because he’s going to be squished.",19,mtms2011-08-8a,,
"Ruby: So you’re saying there’s going to be four people at each table, or three? ",20,mtms2011-08-8a,,
Ellen: Three. Three at each table.,21,mtms2011-08-8a,,
"Gareth: No, no, look, you eliminate ",22,mtms2011-08-8a,,

"The teacher in this class introduced the task and allowed students to work with their peers. Some attempted to act it out, some used square tiles, and others started drawing figures. In all cases, students began their investigation grounded in the context of the party. Two students, Gareth and Ellen,  debated the fate of seated party guests if the tables were pushed together. Would the guests be “squished”? Would they be asked to move to the next available spot? Would it be a good ",24,mtms2011-08-8a,,
"As the students debated, they created drawings to represent their thinking. Figure 1a shows this first drawing. Each table is clearly represented as a square with four guests, one on each side. But as tables are moved together, some of the seats for the guests are eliminated. Figure 1a was, in fact, the first step that Gareth and Ellen took in mathematizing this situation. ",25,mtms2011-08-8a,,
"Note that the work in this class  had been grounded in the belief that mathematical reasoning can best be developed when students are given the opportunity to engage in contextual situations that the students themselves mathematize—exploring situations mathematically, looking for relations, and building explanations and conjectures as they do so (Fosnot and Dolk 2002; Freudental 1968). ",26,mtms2011-08-8a,,
"Using their representation, Gareth  and Ellen determined an initial solution to the Party problem. Their teacher listened and examined the representation that students produced as they described their process. The figure and their thinking were strongly grounded in the context. The teacher eventually wanted them to generalize their findings, so she encouraged them to pursue their investigation through the use of their representation. “I see what you are saying: You eliminate two guests. But could this drawing have more to say? I wonder if there’s more here for us to find out. We might want to have more tables.” After asking these questions and making these comments, the teacher left the students so they could negotiate their next steps.  iteRative cycles in the pRocess of RepResenting",27,mtms2011-08-8a,,
"The representation that Gareth and Ellen produced was only the first step in their mathematical activity. Gravemeijer (1999) described four levels of mathematical activity: (1) activity within the task, (2) activity that refers back to work in the task, (3) general activity, and (4) formal activity. The goal is for students to gradually move from the activity within the task—the counting of guests at the tables—to a general activity that allows them to see a growth pattern and generalize it to other situations. This move is rarely linear. As students move back and forth using their representations, they move toward abstraction. This is a dynamic process of gaining and losing information in their representations: Students lose contextual detail and gain abstracted information. ",28,mtms2011-08-8a,,
"Ellen’s group resumed its work on  the Party problem and produced a new representation (see fig. 1b). The square tables were now moved together, indicating that the issue of displacing guests had been resolved. The guests,  fig. 1 As students worked toward a solution, their representations became increasingly abstract and less representative of the context of the problem.",29,mtms2011-08-8a,,
"(a) (b) (c) depicted as circles, had lost a great deal of their detail, and the drawing was one step removed from context. It was now understood that one does not need to worry about guests moving around. As Ellen produced this second iteration in the representation, Gareth offered a new observation:",30,mtms2011-08-8a,,
"And there’s ten people on each side in a row, so you do ten times two and then on the edge, not the long side, on the short  side . . . There’s two people on one end and on the other end, so you add two people, you add two more people . . . ",31,mtms2011-08-8a,,
"As Gareth explained his thinking, he started producing the third iteration in their representation. As figure 1c suggests, the initial square tables were now irrelevant. The students now saw the efficiency of considering one long block that implied individual tables. The length of this block can be  determined by the number of tables. Gradually, the context faded away as the two students moved closer to a generalized solution. Seth and Ruby, the other two students in the group, continued Gareth’s line of thinking: ",32,mtms2011-08-8a,,
"Seth: You should just put ten times two, because there’s ten squares, right? And, on each side, so there’s ten times two, on both sides, there’s ten. So it’s ten times two. And you add two, because there’s two more edges. ",33,mtms2011-08-8a,,
Ruby: So ten times two equals twenty.,34,mtms2011-08-8a,,
Seth: And plus two.,35,mtms2011-08-8a,,
[…],36,mtms2011-08-8a,,
"Ellen: First it was like squares, and  then this is going to be like a rectangle, so this all is like a one line, one set. This is like, only one segment…",37,mtms2011-08-8a,,
"As groups around the room were having similar insights, the teacher brought the discussion to the whole class. The students were ready to use these representations (see fig. 1c) to talk about general patterns: ",38,mtms2011-08-8a,,
"Anthony: Like what Gareth said, if you look at it across, it’s 2 + 2 = 4, 3 + 3 = 6, 4 + 4 = 8, it’s, like, it’s adding its own. ",39,mtms2011-08-8a,,
Teacher: It’s adding its own. . . . Say  more. What do you mean? […],40,mtms2011-08-8a,,
Gareth: You can do this with one thousand tables and one million!,41,mtms2011-08-8a,,
"The students excitedly continued, realizing the wealth of possibilities afforded by their new understanding and how they were gradually introduced to the use of a variable to represent this reasoning.",42,mtms2011-08-8a,,
"Our focus here is on the path that  the students followed and the role their representations played along the way. In this vignette, we witnessed the gradual transformation of a representation in the  problem-solving process. This process, often missed or overlooked, is illuminating and leads to a better understanding of how students think. The students started their work strongly grounded in the context of the party and guests; it was a context that they gradually mathematized. As students mathematized this situation, they gradually moved from a representation of thinking toward a representation for thinking; it was a shift from thinking about the context to thinking about mathematical relations (Gravemeijer 1999). ",43,mtms2011-08-8a,,
"The students’ representation moved  from showing tables with people, to actions on the people (slashes to show elimination), to a row of tables without people, and fi nally to the abstract rectangle. Each of these increasingly sophisticated and abstract representations provided a glimpse of their understanding.",44,mtms2011-08-8a,,
"This dynamic, iterative cycle of  representing and gradually altering one’s representation to gain new meanings has also been described in the research literature as a “chain of signifi cation” (e.g., Gravemeijer et al. 2002; Meira 2002; Presmeg 1997). A sign—a signifi er of another object— gradually takes on a meaning in itself and can be acted on. In this case, the squares and stick fi gures are a quite realistic representation (or sign) of individual tables seated with people. Gradually, the tables and people do not matter. The squares become an abstract rectangle that leads to the generalized representation of the task.",45,mtms2011-08-8a,,
"Representation for these students is dynamic. They not only create and manipulate their own representations of problem situations but also experience their representations evolving as their reasoning becomes more abstract.  aBstRaction, geneRalization, and tRansfeR As tools, representations help students understand, explore, and communi- fig. 2 Although the triangle-growth-pattern task was more abstract than the Party problem, students were able to connect the two.",46,mtms2011-08-8a,,

"cate (Stylianou 2011). As such, these tools are never invented in what will be their fi nal form. The evolution of representations sheds light on the progress of student thinking, which allows the teacher to provide appropriate support and scaffolding. When students are grounded in the context, illustrated by their drawings of realistic representations of tables and squished guests, the teacher can see that they are grappling with understanding the constraints of the task. Once students have resolved the question of the number of eliminated guests (as shown in fi g. 1b), the teacher can see that the students are considering a more general case.",48,mtms2011-08-8a,,
"Beyond the Party problem, the  learning goal for this instructional unit is for students to abstract their representations and to be able to connect other tasks, situations, and mathematical ideas. Students in this classroom established these connections when they noticed a similarity in the actions they performed on this problem representation and a growth-pattern task involving triangles (see fi g. 2).",49,mtms2011-08-8a,,
Sarah: It’s just the same thing as that one; it’s just that one side is cut off. . . . It’s like the tables. You do the same exact thing that you were going to do there. ,50,mtms2011-08-8a,,
"Simon: […] one triangle has three sides, then if you added another [triangle], that’s six sides all together, but if you put it together, it equals a rhombus and that’s a foursided fi gure, which is a quadrilat- eral. And you are taking those two sides. So it’s two go out, two go in.",51,mtms2011-08-8a,,
"Sarah and Simon independently noticed a similarity between the two growth tasks based on their representations. Once the context was removed, students established a broader connection using geometric properties (i.e., two congruent equilateral triangles connected on one side form a rhombus). As Johanning (2010) noted, when students abstract from context and seek connections, true opportunities for transfer emerge. This action is the transfer of meaningful mathematical ideas.  sUppoRting the pRocess of RepResentation It is widely accepted that “one representation does not fi t all”; we know that students benefi t from a variety of representations. An “exposure to diverse ways of thinking and rich, openended contexts allows students better access to mathematics” (Imm, Stylianou, and Chae 2008, p. 462). The description of this activity presents a more nuanced aspect of that argument: Student-generated representations vary not only across students but also within the work of each student. Individual students’ representations evolve as their work within a problem advances. Similar to the work of mathematicians, students interact with their own representation; this iterative process is central to problem solving (Stylianou and Silver 2004). ",52,mtms2011-08-8a,,
Instruction should present  4 tips to support the Representation processes,53,mtms2011-08-8a,,
These four simple steps will smooth the process when teaching with an emphasis on using representations.,54,mtms2011-08-8a,,
"1. Provide opportunities to work on “cognitively demanding tasks” (Smith and Stein 1998). These tasks challenge students to construct their own understanding, including their own representations. most important, once these tasks are presented, maintain the level of difficulty; provide students with the time and appropriate support to grapple with the tasks on their own.",55,mtms2011-08-8a,,
2. Develop eyes and ears to notice changes in your students’ representations. ,56,mtms2011-08-8a,,
"This, in turn, will help you provide more appropriate and time-sensitive feedback and support.  3. Encourage students to work on their representations, to use them as tools  in their conversations with students, and to keep searching for further insights.",57,mtms2011-08-8a,,
"4. Question the students on their representations. Encourage them to ask  “What if?” and to question one another’s representations.  opportunities that allow for studentgenerated representations. Task choice should allow for exploration through the use of representations. Through interaction with one’s own representation, one engages in the iterative cycles that eventually lead to sophisticated abstracted representations, generalizations, and transfer. As illustrated here, abstracted representations (diagrams or symbolisms) are rarely, if ever, created in their final form. Rather, they are created progressively through a dynamic interaction with one’s own representation. (See the sidebar for classroom tips and ideas.)",58,mtms2011-08-8a,,
"Teachers need to act as facilitators in the representation process that students initiate. Beyond providing high-quality tasks, teachers should allow students to take this path. The teacher’s role is not to prescribe the path but to encourage exploration by the student. Teachers can be the eyes and ears to notice changes in students’ representations. Similar to the teacher in this class, teachers should approach student work with an open mind, ready to listen and engage in the studentgenerated representational process. There are no recipes to achieve this, only genuine interest in students’ ideas and a willingness to support students in their journeys.  ",59,mtms2011-08-8a,,
