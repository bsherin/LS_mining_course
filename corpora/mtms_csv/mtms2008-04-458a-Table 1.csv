"Kara Louise Imm, Despina A. Stylianou, and Nabin Chae tThe NCTM’s Standards (2000)  suggest that a representation is not only a product (a picture, a graph, a number, or a symbolic expression) but also a process, a vehicle for developing an understanding of a mathematical concept and communicating about mathematics. To serve as a vehicle in learning and communication, however, a representation must be personally relevant and meaningful to a student. Therefore, when choosing a representation to explore with a group of students or when reviewing student work, we ought to consider everything that students bring to the classroom. Even at a young age, students come to school with their own, often culturally influenced, valid representations (Lave 1998). Because those representations have been crafted, interpreted, and modified by the students themselves, they become vital to classroom instruction. To dismiss what students bring naturally to the classroom reduces mathematics to a one-way transaction between teacher as expert and student as novice, confirming the notion that a student’s own thinking and all that he or she brings to mathematics is marginal at best. By relocating student-generated representations to the center of the instruction, the nature of how students experience mathematics changes dramatically. It reconsiders mathematics as a vibrant dialogue among different but equally valued thinkers. This deliberate approach to the teaching of mathematics, we believe, becomes vital if we are serious about creating greater equity for our students.",4,mtms2008-04-458a,,
"When representations originate  exclusively from the teacher, they can overshadow any procedure that is student-generated. In classrooms like these, students tend to overinflate the value of any notations that come from the teacher. They may consider these representations to be exclusive of their own thinking, likely to be tested, and  worth mimicking. If so, what is the role of their own thinking, notations, and strategies? Are there, in fact, multiple ways to subtract integers, multiply decimals, or divide fractions or just the way presented by the teacher? In contrast to the type of classroom described here, we present one example of a teacher who consciously chose to allow her students to bring their own representations to class. The choice allowed the students better access to the mathematical ideas of the lesson but also equipped the teacher to build a classroom environment in which each student is expected to engage seriously in cognitively demanding mathematics. At the same time, students are being respected for what they know and bring to the classroom community of learners and are supported in their efforts—the cornerstone ideas behind equity in mathematics learning and teaching.  a MoDel for StuDeNtCeNtereD repreSeNtatIoNS",5,mtms2008-04-458a,,
"Let us now peer into a seventh-grade classroom where the students are exploring rational number. Kara Imm, the teacher, tells the story of two communities in which members are discussing plans for two identical empty lots, each 50 yards × 100 yards. See the description of the problem in figure 1. Imm introduces the playground context as a true-to-life narrative, then presents the dilemma at hand: “I know that many of you like to play basketball or kickball, and we want to find the park with the greater blacktop area. In which park is the blacktop area greater?” She deliberately leaves choices about strategy, representation, and mathematical operation to her students, but encourages them to explore the context and the problem and be able to justify their thinking to the class. There is purposely no explicit mention of multiplication of fractions, rectangular arrays, equivalence, or the  commutative property, although all these big ideas are embedded in her choice of context (identical rectangular lots) and numerical values (2/5 of 3/4 and 3/4 of 2/5).",6,mtms2008-04-458a,,
"First, Imm asks her students to think about the problem for a minute on their own, and then to discuss it with their partner. When she is convinced that everyone has an entry point into the investigation, she sends the students back to their tables. Once there, Charlene and Joey approach the problem by modeling the empty lots as rectangular arrays, dividing each of the empty lots into fourths and fifths, and shading the appropriate section of playground. Charlene creates a drawing of the Carroll Gardens lot, and Joey models the Flatbush lot. As they assemble a poster to share with the class (see fig. 2), they discuss the meaning of the pieces they have drawn:",7,mtms2008-04-458a,,
"Charlene:  OK, I’m doing three out of fourths [draws a rectangle, divides it into four equal areas, and shades three of  fig. 1 The Playground problem",8,mtms2008-04-458a,,
"Two communities in Brooklyn, Carroll Gardens and Flatbush, each gather to make plans for an empty lot in their neighborhood. The lots are identical in size, measuring 50 yards × 100 yards. In Carroll Gardens, the community group decides to allocate 3/4 of the empty lot to playground and cover 2/5 of this playground with blacktop. The Flatbush neighborhood will devote 2/5 of the lot to playground, and 3/4 of the playground will be covered in blacktop. Since you are middle schoolers, and many of you like to play basketball or kickball, we want to find the park with the greatest blacktop area. In which park is the blacktop area greater?",9,mtms2008-04-458a,,
"T, fig. 2 Charlene and Joey’s poster",10,mtms2008-04-458a,,
"T, them]. And I divided it into five pieces and shaded out two. So, this much of the playground [shows the three-fourths shaded area], umm . . . this much of the lot is where the playground is going to be. . . . Oh, wait, but I did this wrong. I shouldn’t have shaded this, I should only shade this because only this much of the playground is going to be blacktop. . . . 	Where did this six- twentieths [pointing to their note under the diagram] come from? You said that you cut the lot into fourths and then into fifths. And these pieces were doubleshaded. What does the double shading mean?",11,mtms2008-04-458a,,

 Wait! Three-fourths is the Joey: playground and then we did the blacktop over. . . . These three are the playground. So it’s six out of twenty is the blacktop. ,14,mtms2008-04-458a,,
"Eventually, Charlene and Joey note that in both neighborhoods, 6/20 of the entire lot is reserved for blacktop space. They write, “Which lot will have more blacktop? The answer is none. They are both the same.” Additionally, their conjecture contains  fig. 3 Amanda and Rodney’s poster fig. 4 Robert and Nestor’s poster",15,mtms2008-04-458a,,
"T, tremendous insight and allows them to conclude that “2/5 of 3/4 is the same as 3/4 of 2/5.” Although there is no evidence that Joey and Charlene conceive of the task as the multiplication of fractions, their representation of 2/5 of 3/4 and 3/4 of 2/5 suggests some important conceptual understanding. Their poster (see fig. 2) allows them and their classmates to quickly compare the relative areas of the blacktop regions.",16,mtms2008-04-458a,,
Imagine yourself in Imm’s position. ,17,mtms2008-04-458a,,
"You have dedicated a considerable amount of instruction time to allowing students to develop their own representations and pursue their own solution paths. What happens next to these rich conversations and representations? How do all of these artifacts of work and thinking influence her instructional choices and allow her to move forward with respect to the classroom community? We argue that by allowing students to create and share their own representations, Imm facilitated the creation of a more equitable learning environment in three important ways, as we elaborate on below: (a) by helping students feel that they are a part of the culture of mathematics, (b) by creating a mathematics community, and (c) by holding students accountable for their mathematical growth.",18,mtms2008-04-458a,,

"Charlene and Joey might have used a number of different strategies based on different representations, but their eventual choice, which made the most sense to them, was to draw a rectangular array and subsequently divide it into subsections of playground and blacktop. As they reshaded the playground in black marker to represent the blacktop “covering,” one can imagine that countless experiences as a child in an urban park might have influenced their representation. As such, it was vital that they start there and not accept a representation that they did not craft themselves.",20,mtms2008-04-458a,,
"By allowing Charlene and Joey to create their own representation, Imm tacitly sends the message that mathematics can be owned by students. Their work was neither dismissed as erroneous or incomplete nor ignored as assorted scribbling in a notebook but validated both privately and publicly. This message forms a steppingstone for students to enter the world of mathematics. These student- generated representations can be the entry point from which Imm, the teacher, will support further development of formal representations.",21,mtms2008-04-458a,,

"Following the student work time in  the classroom vignette discussed above, Imm reconvenes students in the meeting area to discuss their findings. Of the eleven pairs of students in her class that day, she carefully chooses four posters to share (see figs. 2–5). These posters illustrate a variety of strategies and representations that students used but also highlight the development of mathematical ideas  she wanted the class to explore. Although Charlene and Joey’s poster  is a particularly powerful and vivid representation, so too are many of the other posters she does not choose. In fact, by discussing and questioning several different but related strategies, the students gain deeper insights into important mathematical ideas. ",25,mtms2008-04-458a,,
"Charlene and Joey are then invited to share their poster with their peers. Unlike other classroom sharing sessions, they can expect to be asked to explain and defend their choices,  field questions from their peers, and make connections to others’ work and thinking. Their representation reveals some possible misconceptions, such as the labeling of the Carroll Gardens playground’s width simultaneously as 2/5 (on the top edge) and 3/4 (on the bottom edge). Imm is not hoping for a single “perfect” poster but rather a series of representations that will support an entire class conversation. This serves to validate Charlene and Joey’s thinking process and also to honor their finished product. The representation becomes part of the classroom discussion for others to witness and eventually come to know. For Imm, the class discussion is not showcasing neat strategies or pretty posters but vibrant dialogue between and among diverse mathematical thinkers. As the conversation unfolds,  students begin to use Charlene and Joey’s model and refer to it as “Charlene and Joey’s strategy.” Engle and Conant (2002) discuss the principle of “authority” in which the learning environment “authorizes” students to attempt to solve mathematical problems. Students such as Charlene and Joey are publicly credited as “authors” of their ideas and develop into local “authorities” in the discipline (see, also, Lampert 1990 and Stein et al. 2003). The subtlety of this notion is important. It is not only an issue of building confidence in students but of changing students’ perceptions of mathematics within a classroom community. Making mathematics a part of the culture of the community occurs when we acknowledge that a particular representation was not imposed by an outside authority but was created by a mathematician among us. ",26,mtms2008-04-458a,,
Imm shows her respect for the  authority of her students by allowing them to share their work and also by reflecting on the students’ ideas. She listens carefully to their language and uses it once again as a way to introduce ,27,mtms2008-04-458a,,
"T, standard and formal mathematical terminology: “So, an equivalent fraction is the same amount?” she asks. “It’s just, as you said, ‘using smaller numbers.’ ” The concept of equivalent fractions can now be traced to Charlene and Joey’s ",28,mtms2008-04-458a,,

"If we were only interested in mechanically finding answers, then there would be little purpose in exploring other student representations. After all, Charlene and Joey noted that the blacktop regions are equal in area, which was the answer to Imm’s initial question. But the playgrounds task was designed to allow students to conjecture, invent, question, experiment, reason, and problem solve, just as real mathematicians. In choosing the context of the playground, Imm  hoped, for example, that a rich conversation about the commutativity of multiplication of fractions would emerge. ",31,mtms2008-04-458a,,
"Once students are permitted the  freedom to create their own representation and are encouraged to share them with their peers and make them public, the next step is to encourage a level of accountability to the community and to the mathematics (Cobb, Wood, and Yackel 1993; Engle and Connant 2002). It does not suffice to share interesting representations and ideas; the community needs to scrutinize and be critical of these ideas before they are incorporated into the toolbox of resources for the community. Students are aware of the value of the process: They did not simply participate in a show-andtell activity but acted as, and were treated like, real mathematicians. Their representation passed a level of scrutiny that proved the value of their contribution; they are equal partners in this field. ",32,mtms2008-04-458a,,
"No less important to the notion   of holding students accountable individually is the collective sense of accountability. When she senses that some students are not following the conversation, Imm refuses to forge ahead. Ideally, students need to feel safe enough to admit their confusion publicly. Take, for example, the case  of Dale. After studying Robert and Nestor’s poster (see fig. 4) in relation to the others, Dale boldly admits, “Um, I don’t understand . . . on Nestor’s paper he didn’t have so much empty space, and on everybody else’s graph they had like a lot of empty space.” He is referring here to the space in each lot that is not allocated to playground, which Charlene and Joey have designated with Xs. ",33,mtms2008-04-458a,,
"Dale’s admission brings a number  of students into the conversation. Imm clarifies his question and then passes the conversation to Joey. Joey  comments, “It’s actually the same thing; he just did it the other way.” When pushed to explain, he says, “He puts fourths on the side and fifths on the top.” Though there are nods of agreement, Dale remains unconvinced. Major is invited to share a different way to explain the representation of the empty space: “Like Nestor, he like took the four and lined them up right here and I did in a different way. Instead of putting them on the side I put them on top.” Lisa restates the idea: “Instead of putting the blacktop pieces on the side like Nestor did . . . he put them on the top. So he did it like sort of horizontally and put the extra right under it. And Nestor did it vertically.” fINal reMarKS",34,mtms2008-04-458a,,
"It is well known that students often feel that mathematics is not part of their cultural toolkit, in effect, that they are not meant to be good at mathematics. Attaining equity in mathematics performance for urban students in particular involves validating the knowledge that they bring to classroom settings, which may include cultural, linguistic, and informal ways of knowing in addition to formal, or academic, learning that they have encountered in school. This means acknowledging and naming what students know, as revealed in their representations, conversations, and other ways of thinking. The use of student-generated representations reemphasizes the notion that students can, in fact, explore and solve mathematical problems on their own, especially when they are expected to share their representations with others. ",35,mtms2008-04-458a,,
"To be clear, we are not striving for equality or treating all students in a uniform or identical manner but are mindful of equity by offering fair and appropriate opportunities for each student (Banks and Banks  1995; Rubel and Meyer 2005). That is, instead of one representation fits all, we know that different students require knowledge and exploration of a variety of representations, most notably their own. This exposure to diverse ways of thinking and rich, open-ended contexts allows students better access to mathematics. Too often these student-generated representations are used minimally or treated as marginal to a teacher’s instructional goals. We maintain that appropriate use of student-generated representations in a classroom can be a powerful tool, not only with respect to students’ mathematical growth, but also in our perennial struggle to attain equity in mathematics classes.
