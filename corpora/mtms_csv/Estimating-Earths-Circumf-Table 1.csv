0,Estimating Earths Circumference with an App - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"More than 2,200 years ago,  Eratosthenes, who was a Greek astronomer, geographer, and mathematician, used a simple proportion involving the distance between two ancient cities and measures of shadows cast in those cities during a summer solstice to estimate the circumference of Earth (Nicastro 2008, 25â€“28). Today, middle school students can use similar proportional reasoning with physical measurements easily collected by a smart phone and trundle wheel to duplicate the feat of estimating Earthâ€™s circumference. Within this hands-on discovery activity, students explore the seventh-grade Common Core standard to â€œanalyze proportional relationships and use them to solve real-world and mathematical problemsâ€ (CCSSI 2010, p. 47) using popular technology and integrating concepts of latitude and longitude.",,

2,Estimating Earths Circumference with an App - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Similar to Eratosthenesâ€™s method of estimating Earthâ€™s circumference, the focus of this activity is on developing a proportion with angle measurements and distances. Before beginning work on the problem, students must first understand the basics of latitude and longitude. These concepts are often discussed in social studies classes but can be reviewed in math classes using images similar to those in figure 1.",,

4,Estimating Earths Circumference with an App - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Figure 1a illustrates that any line of longitude serves as the circumference of Earth, the distance around the sphere intersecting two endpoints of a diameter. In this case, the endpoints are the North and South Poles. In contrast, each line of latitude in  figure 1b runs parallel to the equator; the resulting circles, excluding the equator, do not intersect both endpoints of a diameter and are thus smaller than Earthâ€™s circumference.",,
5,Estimating Earths Circumference with an App - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Although students may be familiar with the typical map or globe representation of parallel latitude lines and their corresponding measurements in degrees, they may not have the deeper understanding of how those measurements are found, a critical component to developing the proportion used to estimate Earthâ€™s circumference. Latitude measurements can be illustrated by a longitudinal cross section of a globe (see fig. 2).",,
6,Estimating Earths Circumference with an App - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
7,Estimating Earths Circumference with an App - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The latitude at  point A is equal to the measurement of the angle formed by point A, the center of Earth (C), and a second point (E) along the same line of longitude intersecting the equator. Thus, the latitude measurement at point A is equivalent to the measure of",,
8,Estimating Earths Circumference with an App - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"An important benchmark is to have students develop the understanding that the ratio of  to the entire circle (360Â°) is proportional to the arc length (AE), the distance from point A to point E along the line of longitude, to Earthâ€™s circumference. This task involves comparing two part-to-whole ratios, one involving angles and the other involving distances, as illustrated in figure 3.",,
9,Estimating Earths Circumference with an App - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
10,Estimating Earths Circumference with an App - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Once an understanding of this basic proportion has been established, the teacher can transition to constructing a proportion involving an angle in which neither side lies along the equator. This second proportion models the relatively small distance between two arbitrary points, A and B, on a line of longitude that students will need to walk and measure along with the corresponding  (see fig. 4).",,
11,Estimating Earths Circumference with an App - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
12,Estimating Earths Circumference with an App - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Students should be asked to create a new proportion using the distance between points A and B. Just as the â€œpartâ€ component of the distance ratio has changed, so too must the â€œpartâ€ component of the angle ratio change to maintain the proportion.",,

14,Estimating Earths Circumference with an App - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Knowing that latitude measurements are directly related to an underlying angle with its vertex at Earthâ€™s center and one side along the equator, students can find the angle measurement between any two latitude points on a common line of longitude as a difference between the two latitude measurements",,
15,Estimating Earths Circumference with an App - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
16,Estimating Earths Circumference with an App - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"As the goal of this activity is to estimate Earthâ€™s circumference, students should be asked to identify each part of the proportion that they will need to measure and suggest ways that these measurements can be made, so that the circumference remains the only unknown. Students may feel comfortable with their proposed ideas for measuring distance. However, the teacher will likely need to introduce the benefits of a trundle wheel for measuring long distances and the availability of smart phone apps, or equivalent, to measure latitude.",,
17,Estimating Earths Circumference with an App - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,TECHNOLOGY PREPARATION AND FIELD SELECTION,,
18,Estimating Earths Circumference with an App - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"To prepare for the fieldwork, select a technology app that provides latitude and longitude coordinates of your location. We suggest the app My GPS Coordinates (GPS Tools 2015) by TappiApps; measurements are recorded as degrees in decimal format as opposed to degrees, minutes, and seconds. Select an open field or parking lot whose north-south dimension is at least 100 meters. The selected area should be relatively level and free from obstacles allowing students to use a trundle wheel to record distance walked. Use Google Maps (Google 2015) to survey the area around your school for a suitable location.",,

25,Estimating Earths Circumference with an App - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"At this point, students have established that on a given line of longitude, the ratio of the distance between two points to the entire circumference is in proportion to the ratio of the change in latitude to 360 degrees.",,
26,Estimating Earths Circumference with an App - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Determining how to transfer the model developed on paper to fieldwork that students can implement may generate additional questions. Students will likely experience two main challenges: maintaining a line of longitude and walking far enough to reduce the error in GPS measurements so that an estimate with relatively good precision may be obtained.,,
27,Estimating Earths Circumference with an App - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Finding a Line of Longitude,,
28,Estimating Earths Circumference with an App - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"It is easy to draw an arbitrary line of longitude on a diagram, but how can you find a line in practice? Students will need to wrestle with the idea that an infinite number of lines of longitude exist and that any chosen line of longitude will suffice for this activity. Even after students identify the latitude and longitude readings of their starting location, they may find it challenging to stay on that line of longitude as they walk. If the application does not specifically identify â€œlongitude,â€ students will need to reason that to walk north-south on a line of longitude, one must keep the east-west measurement constant. This reinforces the definition that lines of longitude run north-south and measure degrees east and west of the Prime Meridian. Likewise, lines of latitude run east-west and measure degrees north-south of the equator.",,
29,Estimating Earths Circumference with an App - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Reasoning about Measurement Error,,
30,Estimating Earths Circumference with an App - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Regardless of the chosen software application, reported latitude and longitude readings will have an inherent error in measurement. Students should be encouraged to discuss how they can minimize the error. The greater the distance between the markers, the less influence the absolute error of measurement has.",,
31,Estimating Earths Circumference with an App - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Compounding the error in measurement is the difficulty that students will likely experience with fluctuating readings even when they are standing still. As students try to walk a line of longitude, it may be helpful to have the goal of maintaining the longitude reading to the nearest 0.0001. As 1 degree latitude is equivalent to 111,128 meters, a difference of 0.0001 is equivalent to roughly 11 meters.  We recommend a distance of at least 100 meters between markers to reduce the effect of measurement error, including fluctuations in readings.",,
32,Estimating Earths Circumference with an App - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Taking Measurements,,
33,Estimating Earths Circumference with an App - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Students should place their first marker and record both the longitude and latitude readings. Keeping the longitude reading consistent to the nearest 0.0001 , students should walk along a line of longitude a distance greater than 100 meters before placing their second marker. Walking slowly will enable studentsâ€™ movement to keep pace with the softwareâ€™s location updates, which may be once per second. A trundle wheel can be used to measure the distance; however, its initial reading should be considered a rough estimate because students will most likely not be able to walk in a straight line while continually adjusting their position to maintain the longitude reading. Giving students the choice of distance between markers emphasizes the conceptual model and not the specifics of the process and encourages students to reason about minimizing error. Longer distances between markers tend to result in more accurate estimates of Earthâ€™s circumference. Imaginary lines formed by each groupâ€™s markers should be roughly parallel.",,
34,Estimating Earths Circumference with an App - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Once students mark and record the latitude reading at the second marker, they should deliberately use the trundle wheel to more accurately measure the distance between markers. Ideally, students should take the average of multiple measurements of the distance between markers. Comparatively, taking multiple latitude readings at a marker is challenging as the longitude reading at that marker will also fluctuate, and students will find it difficult to maintain their line of longitude. Once students have the two latitude readings, they can find the difference in latitude equal to the measure of  in figure 4. Using this angle, the distance between markers, and the knowledge that there are 360 degrees in a circle, students can use the proportion",,

In addition to strengthening studentsâ€™ ability to reason with proportions, this cross-discipline activity uses and strengthens the social studies concepts of latitude and longitude. Furthermore, it makes explicit conceptual connections between the disciplines as the degree of a line of latitude is defined by the measurement of its underlying angle.",,
