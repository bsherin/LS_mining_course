0,Fun with Triangular Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"It is a beautiful summer day on the central coast of California. While some students are enjoying days at the park or at the beach, forty middle school students are in a classroom solving challenging mathematics problems. And they are loving it!",,
1,Fun with Triangular Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The second Math Camp for middle school students was offered in 2013 at a western university for students from local school districts. For three days, these students met from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. to enjoy mathematics and to work hard. Students persevered in finding solutions, sharing different ways of thinking, providing logical arguments, and presenting solutions for whole-group discussionall practices that align directly with the Common Cores Standards for Mathematical Practices (CCSSI 2010). These standards urge educators to provide experiences that help students develop deeper understanding. What follows are examples of rich problems related to triangular numbers, students ways of thinking about them, and our experiences with the students during the camp. An activity sheet is included as a resource for teachers.",,
2,Fun with Triangular Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,PROBLEM 1: THE HANDSHAKE PROBLEM,,
3,Fun with Triangular Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"At a party, everyone shakes hands once with every other person. When there is only 1 person, there are  0 handshakes. When there are  2 people, there is 1 handshake.  Act out the handshakes if there are  3 people. . . . This classic problem is a natural starting point for this cluster of tasks. With proper scaffolding, it can be accessed by all students because it can be acted out, illustrated on paper, organized in a chart, and generalized.",,
4,Fun with Triangular Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"When we presented the scenario for the Handshake problem, we asked various students to act out the situation for the first several people who came to the party, emphasizing the parameters of the problem clearly: Everyone shakes hands with every other person just once, and no one shakes his or her own hand. As students acted out the handshakes, the teacher recorded the number of people and the number of handshakes carefully in a systematic list, so that data could be analyzed for patterns. Modeling the organization of data is an essential element for future progress. Furthermore, the patterns that emerged in the illustrations and charts provided a recursive approach that encourages even the most reluctant of students to find success.",,
5,Fun with Triangular Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Before long, most students saw the pattern: Each time one more person was added to the group, the number of handshakes increased by 1 more than the previous time. In fact, if there were four people gathered and there were  6 handshakes, a fifth person joining the group would result in 4 more handshakes, for a total of 10, because that new person would have to shake hands with every other person already at the party.",,
6,Fun with Triangular Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"At this point, it may be useful for the teacher to express or emphasize the total number of handshakes as a sum, if students do not do it themselves, so that students can begin to observe patterns and start to use structure to make generalizations. For example, if there are 5 students, student 1 will shake hands with 4 students; student 2, with 3 students; and so on, for an expression 4 + 3 + 2 + 1.",,
7,Fun with Triangular Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Writing the expanded sum provides more information than the end result of 10. This is a good example of a situation in which the compact answer hides the underlying patterns. Students need to look for and express regularity in repeated reasoning to conclude that with n people, there must be 1 + 2 + 3 +  + (n  1) handshakes. They would then need to find a way to add these numbers effectively.",,
8,Fun with Triangular Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Several students formed pairs by adding 1 + (n  1); 2 + (n  2); and so on, to make sums equal to n. In the case of 5 students, you form the sums 1 + 4 and 2 + 3. Students figured out that when n is odd, n  1 is even,  and so they would be able to form  (n  1)/2 pairs each equal to n. This will produce",,

When n is even, n  1 is odd; students realized that they can make (n/2)  1 pairs each equal to n, but n/2 will be left unpaired and would have to be added. In the case of 6 students, the sums 1 + 5 and  2 + 4 are formed; 3 is left unpaired. This situation will produce",,

20,Fun with Triangular Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"If the students are unfamiliar with Gausss trick for adding consecutive numbers, you may wish to show it to them for future use. If we had 10 students, the number of handshakes would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +  + 8 + 9. If we let S = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +  + 8 + 9, then",,

22,Fun with Triangular Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,S = 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1.,,
23,Fun with Triangular Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Adding vertically, we get 2S = 10(9). We want the value for S, so we divide by 2 to get S = 10(9)/2. In a similar form, we would get",,

27,Fun with Triangular Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,PROBLEM 2: POINTS  IN A PLANE,,
28,Fun with Triangular Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"If 6 points are in a plane, and no  3 point are collinear, what is the maximum number of different straight lines that pass through exactly 2 points? Although this problem provided a slightly less concrete situation, it could still be modeled easily on paper or on the white board. It also provided a very nice connection to problem 1. Students were encouraged to work together to solve it.",,
29,Fun with Triangular Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The beauty of this task is that it is easy to attack. However, before students begin to explore on their own, make certain they understand what the phrase collinear points in the plane means. Suggest that students start with some easy models, such as  3 points arranged in triangular fashion or 4 points set in a basic quadrilateral. This will allow them to familiarize themselves with working with a simpler case and making a chart to organize data clearly, as was previously modeled with the Handshake problem. On the other hand, if some students want to dive right into the challenge of using all 6 points, this situation provides an excellent opportunity to emphasize the importance of precision by using a sharpened pencil and a straight edge so that drawings are precise. Patience, perseverance, and precision are invaluable tools in mathematics.",,
30,Fun with Triangular Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"At our Math Camp, most of the students followed Enriques example (see fig. 1 for his solution and justification). Note how clearly he explains why division by 2 makes sense in this case (because one line should not be counted twice).",,
31,Fun with Triangular Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"This problem is not only elegant in its simplicity but also a perfect parallel to the Handshake problem. Essentially, the two problems are the same: The people are the noncollinear points, the handshakes are the straight lines between points, and vice versa. If some students seem ready, challenge them to find a formula that will generalize the number of handshakes generated by any number of persons or the maximum number of different straight lines that can be drawn, given any number of noncollinear points in the plane. Students who are not ready for the general formula can still make generalizations with concrete examples. This experience will prepare them to consider the next challenge, the sequence of triangular numbers.",,
32,Fun with Triangular Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,PROBLEM 3: TRIANGULAR NUMBER SEQUENCE,,
33,Fun with Triangular Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Each number in the sequence  1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, . . . is called a  triangular number because each can be represented with dots that can be arranged to form a triangle. Show students at least one example to make sure they understand why certain numbers are called triangular numbers. For example, 6 is a triangular number because six dots can form a triangle. Students were then asked to guess a formula for the general, or nth, term of the  sequence of triangular numbers. To solve this problem, students drew a variety of pictures, each showing why a number was called triangular (see fig. 2).",,
34,Fun with Triangular Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Using equilateral and right as descriptors of the triangles, students noticed that 6 = 1 + 2 + 3 and that each number in the triangular number sequence was the sum of consecutive integers beginning with 1. Some students recognized that they can use Gausss method for determining the sums of 1, 1 + 2, 1 + 2 + 3, 1 + 2 + 3 + 4, . . . , 1 + 2 + 3 +  + 100. From this sequence, the formula n(n + 1)/2 emerged. Point out that this formula is similar but not equal to the number of handshakes, but the reasoning behind both formulas is the same. When students were ready, we introduced the next problem.",,
35,Fun with Triangular Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,PROBLEM 4: MAXIMUM LINES TO DIVIDE THE PLANE,,
36,Fun with Triangular Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"What is the maximum number of regions into which n lines can divide the plane? Good notation aided this problem, as did the design of a good data table. We began by suggesting that students denote the answer as R(n), asking for the values R(1), R(2); a few noticed that R(0) = 1 because drawing no line would yield an undivided plane. After about thirty minutes of data collection and work in small clusters, we asked for volunteers to develop the data table (see the student-designed table in fig. 3).",,
37,Fun with Triangular Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Disappointed that the triangular numbers did not magically appear, students nevertheless saw that the differences between the numbers of regions continued to be 1, 2, 3, 4,  5, and 6, which were the same differences that occurred between the numbers in the sequence 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, . . . . At this point, hands  flew up. These region numbers were just one more than the triangular numbers; therefore, the students  were able to generate the formula R(n) = n(n + 1)/2 + 1 (see fig. 4).",,
38,Fun with Triangular Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Next, we tried to lead the students to think recursively. We noted that, for example, the fourth line drawn cuts into each of the previously drawn  three lines, creating the four new regions numbered 8, 9, 10, and 11.   This construction, shown in figure 5a, resulted in R(4) = R(3) + 4. Although not all students completely followed the explanation, the time was well spent. At least several students got a glimpse of a new way to see a recursive process in action.",,
39,Fun with Triangular Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Pushing even a little further, we tried to place this problem in a larger context, asking for the maximum number of segments, L(n), into which n points could divide a line. A chorus of 1, 2, 3, 4, . . . easily produced  L(n) = n + 1 (e.g., 4 points on a line divide that line into five pieces, as shown in fig. 5b). This understanding piqued students interest, and they wanted to know what would happen in a higher dimension.",,
40,Fun with Triangular Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Together we discussed the problem of determining the maximum number of regions, S(n), into which n planes could divide space. Future math majors may have been born at that moment when students saw in the data charts the relationships among L(n), R(n), and S(n). We quickly took a break as we heard phrases and words like higher dimensions and hyper-planes playfully tossed around the room.",,
41,Fun with Triangular Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,PROBLEM 5: TOOTHPICK SQUARES,,
42,Fun with Triangular Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"How many toothpicks does it take to build a square of side length n? Students began collecting data for this problem by simply counting, letting H(n) be the total number of toothpicks required for a square of size n. Some students were able to generate the table by doing several cases. Then from the table, they recognized the appearance of triangular numbers (see table 1). A cluster of students thought the 5  5 shape was too large to actually count; they conjectured that  H(5) = 60 based on the fact that each earlier entry was four times a triangular number. One great guess was the following:",,
43,Fun with Triangular Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
44,Fun with Triangular Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
45,Fun with Triangular Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"There are always a few students who think differently, and the next creative scheme astounded everyone. Jose noticed that in a 5  5 square each  of the six vertical lines consisted of five segments. The same was true  for the horizontal lines, for a total of 2  5  6. Jose kept waving his arms vertically and horizontally until he caught our attention. This was more than an observation or conjecture. It was, in fact, a convincing argument.",,
46,Fun with Triangular Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The work presented by Maria  illustrates nicely this way of thinking (see fig. 6). She illustrates in the fourth case that there are four rows and that each row has 5 toothpicks. Then there are four columns and each column has 5 toothpicks. From this configuration, we can see the formula",,
47,Fun with Triangular Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"n(n + 1) + n(n + 1) = 2n(n + 1),",,
48,Fun with Triangular Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,which made sense to some students.,,
49,Fun with Triangular Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Cesar saw this a little differently. He decomposed the 3  3 figure into two pieces, the perimeter and the inside toothpicks (see fig. 7). He saw the perimeter as consisting of 3 toothpicks for each of 4 sides, or 12 toothpicks. He called the horizontal and vertical inside toothpicks struts. There are two vertical struts, composed of 3 toothpicks each. When this number is doubled to take into account the two horizontal struts, it totals 12 + (2(3)  (3  1)) = 24. In general, Cesar ended with:",,
50,Fun with Triangular Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
51,Fun with Triangular Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
52,Fun with Triangular Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,This experience of sharing different solutions was the perfect opportunity for students not only to construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others (one of the Common Cores Standards for Mathematical Practice) but also to learn from one another and recognize that mathematics problems can be solved in different and creative ways.,,
53,Fun with Triangular Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,PROBLEM 6: RECIPROCAL OF TRIANGULAR NUMBERS,,
54,Fun with Triangular Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Determine a closed formula for the sum of the reciprocals of the triangular numbers; in other words, express the sum of 1 + 1/3 + 1/6 + 1/10 + 1/15 + 1/21 +  + more simply. At first, we thought that this problem might be too tough and too sophisticated to be handled by seventh and eighth graders. However, they surprised us.",,
55,Fun with Triangular Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Setting aside for a moment the student approaches here, we were amazed at the fairly erudite discussion about the three dots, what approaches meant, and about infinity. Before long, students sidetracked us into a discussion of what 0.999 . . . meant, and what the difference 1  0.999 . . . amounted to. If 1.999 . . . was equal to 2, then what is the number before 1.999. . . .? one student asked. Is epsilon equal to 1 over infinity? A discussion about counting numbers and real numbers ensued. Although these questions were only somewhat related to the question as posed, we all enjoyed these learning moments.",,
56,Fun with Triangular Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We then turned to collecting and organizing data, looking for patterns, and drawing conclusions from the data for problem 6. After some work on equivalent fractions, the collection of data for the sum of the reciprocals appeared in tabular form (see table 2). Some students included equivalent fractions, as shown on the second and third rows of the cumulative sums. Using these data, a number of students determined that 2n/(n + 1) was the general term.",,
57,Fun with Triangular Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"One student, James, saw this very differently. Noticing that each partial sum contained a 1, he studied only the fractional part (see fig. 8). He drew a line through the sums once he found a pattern and presented his work to the group. A little algebra will show that",,

60,Fun with Triangular Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,STUDENT FEEDBACK,,
61,Fun with Triangular Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,We asked students what they liked best about Math Camp and in what ways they were challenged or motivated. Responses included the following:,,
62,Fun with Triangular Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Even one of the more advanced students enjoyed working with others to solve problems. He stated, I enjoyed this program because of the teamwork. The students who may have had fewer mathematical experiences enjoyed the challenging work and seeing that other students their ages were able to think in many different ways. We learned that interesting problems and group work can be effective and beneficial to a wide range of middle school students.",,
63,Fun with Triangular Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The students as well as the organizers learned a lot from an enjoyable three days of hard work. We observed with delight that students thrived in an environment in which they were asked to make sense of problems (developing drawings, charts, and organized lists to gather and analyze data) and persevere wholeheartedly in solving them, as stated in the first of the Common Cores Standards for Mathematical Practices (SMP). Using data and perceiving patterns, they were able to reason both abstractly and quantitatively (SMP 2). Working together and listening to student explanations as well as teacher input, they constructed viable arguments and critiqued the reasoning of others (SMP 3).",,
64,Fun with Triangular Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Each problem gave students yet another opportunity to model with mathematics, use tools strategically, and attend to precision (SMP 46). In more than one instance, students needed to go back and check their drawings, their counting, or their reasoning to ensure that the numbers in their charts were accurate. As students tackled a few of the problems that incorporated more challenging variations of the triangular number formula, they continued to look for and make use of structure (SMP 7) and look for and express regularity in repeated reasoning (SMP 8) (CCSSI 2010, pp. 68).",,
65,Fun with Triangular Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Of course, we also learned that as teachers we do not have a monopoly on the best, most creative, and most interesting approaches to a problem.
