0,Percentages and Milk Fat - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Percentages have proven to be a challenging concept in school mathematics. At the surface, a percentage is merely a rational number, representing a ratio between a number and 100. At the conceptual core, however, a percentage is sensitive to the context, making sense with respect to a network of related quantities. In our effort to engage our students in the conceptual exploration of rational numbers, we noticed a milk bottle label (see fig. 1) and posed a few questions about the use of percentages in this context. Simple as it is, the milk label gave us a meaningful lens to explore the dynamics of percentage use in context. In this article, we analyze the Milk Fat problem and the diverse responses of our students (in this case, prospective elementary teachers) because their responses relate to perspectives of additive and multiplicative reasoning and literacy. We further discuss the impact of intervention and the persistence of additive reasoning. We invite our readers to try the problem with their own audiences.",,

2,Percentages and Milk Fat - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,THE MILK FAT PROBLEM,,
3,Percentages and Milk Fat - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,The Milk Fat problem is based on the label from a 2 percent milk container shown in figure 1. The label states that 2 percent reduced- fat milk has 37 percent less fat than regular milk.,,
4,Percentages and Milk Fat - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Assuming that the information is correct, what is the percentage of milk fat in regular milk? To look into prospective elementary teachersâ€™ perceptions and reasoning, we posed the following three questions:",,
5,Percentages and Milk Fat - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,1. What is the meaning of 2 percent on the milk label?,,
6,Percentages and Milk Fat - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"2. As shown on the label, 2 percent milk has 37 percent less fat than regular milk. What is the meaning of 37 percent in this context?",,
7,Percentages and Milk Fat - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"3. If 2 percent milk has 37 percent less fat than regular milk, what is the percentage of fat in regular milk?",,
8,Percentages and Milk Fat - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,PROBLEM ANALYSIS AND FORMAL SOLUTIONS,,
9,Percentages and Milk Fat - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In light of the everyday nature of the Milk Fat problem, we anticipated that the majority of the prospective teachers were aware of the meaning of 2 percent milkâ€”that is, 2 percent of the milk content is milk fat. Further, in the statement that 2 percent milk has 37 percent less fat than regular milk, 37 percent is a ratio between the milk fat difference and the amount of milk fat in regular milk. To demonstrate the process of formal problem solving, let us assume that the percentage of milk fat in regular milk is x. Then, if we take a cup (or any reasonable unit) of regular milk, there is x Ã— cup milk fat in it. If we take a cup of 2 percent milk, there is 0.02 Ã— cup milk fat in it. The difference in milk fat is thus x Ã— cup â€“ 0.02 Ã— cup. Since regular milk is taken as the reference value, then, according to the label,",,
10,Percentages and Milk Fat - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Â,,
11,Percentages and Milk Fat - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,or about 3.2 percent.,,
12,Percentages and Milk Fat - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The solution above illustrates the process of taking the same amount of each type of milk and comparing the two milk fat quantities in a relative manner. At a more abstract level, the 37 percent can be thought of as a comparison of two percentages, or rather a percentage of two percentages (Bennett and Briggs 2011). Therefore, we have the following equation,",,
13,Percentages and Milk Fat - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
14,Percentages and Milk Fat - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"in which x is the percentage of milk fat in regular milk. The implicit assumption is that we are using the same amount (i.e., the abstract unit 1) from both types of milk as a reference. In our classroom practice, we found one prospective teacher who wrote 0.63x = 0.02 in the preassessment without further explanation. She seemed to think that the 2 percent is 63 percent of the percentage of milk fat in regular milk. In light of her overall performance in class, we believe that she understood the structure of the problem situation at a formal level.",,
15,Percentages and Milk Fat - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,FORMATIVE ASSESSMENT,,
16,Percentages and Milk Fat - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Percentages are used every day in all kinds of real-world and academic situations. It is safe to assume that all our prospective teachers have seen and used percentages to some extent in their prior schooling and life experiences. Therefore, as a no-risk assessment, we presented the Milk Fat problem to our prospective teachers from three mathematics methods classes in fall 2015 and spring 2016 at a large state university in the Midwest. We asked the teachers to respond anonymously to the problem to the best of their knowledge at that moment. A total of 44 responses were received and subsequently analyzed for patterns of mathematical reasoning. We wanted to understand what the prospective teachers bring to our teacher education classroom as a precursor for further instruction or intervention design. The formal solutions mentioned above are largely missing in the diverse responses we collected from the prospective teachers. In what follows, we summarize our findings with respect to the three questions.",,
17,Percentages and Milk Fat - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Question 1: What Is the Meaning of 2 Percent on the Milk Label?,,
18,Percentages and Milk Fat - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Conventionally, the 2 percent on the milk label means that the milk has 2 percent milk fat in it. For example, an 8 ounce cup of 2 percent milk has 0.16 ounces of milk fat. The responses of our prospective teachers, however, point to the possibility of multiple interpretations on their part. Fourteen of the 44 prospective teachers did not see 2 percent in the conventional way, namely, that 2 percent milk has 2 percent fat in the content. Among the various interpretations, six prospective teachers indicated that the milk has 2 percent less fat in it, or in other words, 2 percent of the fat in regular milk is removed during processing. For example, one person interpreted it as â€œthere is only 2 percent of the natural fat in the milk.â€ We were surprised at the divergent interpretations, which all seemed to make some sense within the specific context.",,
19,Percentages and Milk Fat - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Question 2: What Is the Meaning of 37 Percent?,,
20,Percentages and Milk Fat - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In the statement that 2 percent milk has 37 percent less fat than regular milk, 37 percent refers to the relative difference in milk fat between 2 percent milk and regular milk, using regular milk as a reference. Twenty-five of the 44 prospective teachers did understand 37 percent in the conventional way, indicating that â€œthere is 37 percent less fat in 2 percent milk than [in] regular milk.â€ For example, one prospective teacher explained that â€œthe 2 percent milk would have 63 percent of the fat content that whole milk does, so 37 percent of the total amount of fat was lopped off.â€",,
21,Percentages and Milk Fat - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"However, 19 of the 44 prospective teachers did not see it that way and gave various interpretations. A few indicated that regular milk should have 39 percent or 35 percent milk fat, showing their intuitive thoughts. Interestingly, three prospective teachers tended to think that â€œregular milk has 37 percent more fat than 2 percent milk.â€ This response evidently uses additive or whole-number reasoning on a multiplicative problem, which is consistent with previous research findings (Lamon 2005). For example, eight is two less than ten, which means, alternatively, that ten is two more than eight, under addition and subtraction. In general, A = B â€“ C is equivalent to B = A + C in the world of additive relationships.",,
22,Percentages and Milk Fat - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Question 3: If 2 Percent Milk Has 37 Percent Less Fat Than Regular Milk, What Is the Percentage of Fat in Regular Milk?",,
23,Percentages and Milk Fat - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The prospective teachersâ€™ responses to questions 1 and 2 helped us make sense of their approaches to question 3, which is about the milk fat percentage in regular milk. Among the 44 responses, only two were correct. The rest converged to one themeâ€”various forms of additive reasoning, namely, using addition and subtraction on percentages without considering their reference values. Instead of using a right-wrong dichotomy, we tallied the various responses to gain insight into our prospective teachersâ€™ thinking about the problem. A frequency chart of their responses (see fig. 2) provides a big picture of the prospective teachersâ€™ approaches to the Milk Fat problem. Notably, eleven prospective teachers added 37 percent and 2 percent for 39 percent; eight teachers subtracted 37 percent from 100 percent for 63 percent; and four teachers thought that regular milk has 100 percent milk fat, by which they must have meant that regular milk has 100 percent of the natural milk fat, in close analysis. It is evident from these responses that the vast majority were confused about the whole in this problem situation. Strikingly, all the prospective teachers approached the problem from a formulaic or rule-based perspective. Nobody drew a diagram to model the mathematical processes behind the problem situation. It seemed that at the first glimpse of the problem, they automatically switched to an intuitive formula mode to the extent of losing sight of the unreasonableness of their solutions. Regular milk cannot be 39 percent fat, not to speak of 63 percent or even 100 percent fat. Perhaps some deep cognitive reasons and literacy issues are behind these mathematical behaviors.",,
24,Percentages and Milk Fat - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
25,Percentages and Milk Fat - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,THROUGH A LITERACY LENS,,
26,Percentages and Milk Fat - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Underlying the diverse responses of our prospective teachers, there seems to be a literacy dimension that involves the meaningful use of mathematical terms, notations, and language. Indeed, all school mathematics has a literacy component in that everyday language supports and constrains mathematical sense making. This is particularly true in the case of percentages, which are pervasive in everyday situations from food labels to news reports. Our use of percentages in context is constrained by both our linguistic conventions and mathematical processes. In the context of percentages and milk fat, three questions are worth exploring from a literacy perspective.",,
27,Percentages and Milk Fat - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"First, what is an appropriate way to describe a type of milk with 2 percent fat? Should we say â€œ2 percent reduced fat milkâ€ or â€œ2 percent fat milkâ€ or just â€œ2 percent milkâ€? The word reduced may have led some prospective teachers to think that â€œ2 percent means 2 percent of the original milk fat is removed,â€ although within the specific context, both 2 percent and reduced fat are qualifiers for the noun milk. In fact, ten prospective teachers responded that â€œthere is 2 percent of milk fat in the milk,â€ indicating that they were using the natural milk fat as a reference value. Although â€œ2 percent fat milkâ€ seems appropriate, â€œ2 percent milkâ€ is often used in everyday conversations, leaving milk fat as an assumption for the listener or reader, who would interpret â€œ2 percent milkâ€ as â€œ2 percent of the milk is milk fat.â€ Here we see a close interplay between language practices and mathematical processes.",,
28,Percentages and Milk Fat - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Second, is a percentage just a special number? As a rational number, 37 percent is equivalent to 0.37 and 37/100. If a percentage, say, N, is just a number, then A â€“ N = B is equivalent to A = B + N. That seems to be the underlying additive schema behind eleven prospective teachersâ€™ responses (see fig. 2): If 2 percent milk has 37 percent less fat than regular milk, then regular milk has 37 percent more fat than 2 percent milkâ€”hence, the 39 percent response. As a matter of fact, percentages are almost always used in a relative or multiplicative sense (Lamon 2005), which is a mathematical and linguistic convention. Unfortunately, a great number of prospective teachers did not have the opportunity to develop such a meaningful perspective during their middle school mathematics experiences. It is a subtle yet critical transition from whole-number sense to rational number sense. The idea can be best illustrated through examples. Let us look at 4 and 10. Four is 60 percent less than ten, but ten is 150 percent more than four.",,
29,Percentages and Milk Fat - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Third, does of always mean times in English? In many assessments, we asked prospective teachers, as an example, why two-thirds of 57 can be found by 2/3 Ã— 57. A similar question was posed about percentages. The vast majority replied that in English of means times, which reflects the way similar problems are treated in textbooksâ€”it is just a rule. However, rules rarely help us develop sound number sense (Lamon 2005), as is clearly seen in the diverse responses presented here. Indeed, in this particular case, it is true that of can be pragmatically replaced by times. Without further analysis, however, this rule can lead to more misconceptions in the future when of  is not identical to times, such as in the case of function composition in algebra. In this regard, Lamon (2005) recommends conceptualizing a rational number followed by of as a mathematical operator or a function that performs a process or a sequence of processes on a given quantity. For example, â€œ2 percent ofâ€ is, as a whole, interpreted as an operator that takes a certain amount B out of A such that B/A = 2/100. The operator perspective avoids equating of with times and helps clarify the essential proportional relationship behind this type of problem situation.",,
30,Percentages and Milk Fat - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,INTERVENTION AND THE PERSISTENCE OF MISCONCEPTIONS,,
31,Percentages and Milk Fat - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The analysis of prospective teachersâ€™ responses laid the foundation for our subsequent intervention and instruction. In small-group and whole-class discussions, we addressed the literacy aspects of percentages, the distinction between additive reasoning and multiplicative reasoning, the use of models and diagrams in sense making, and the evaluation of solutions. We also invited individual students to share ideas in their own words. Figure 3 shows a summary of the key interventions. In one of the classes, we assessed their emerging proportional understanding on two occasionsâ€”the midterm and the final exam, using the following problem, slightly adjusted for a test of understanding.",,
32,Percentages and Milk Fat - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
33,Percentages and Milk Fat - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Assume that whole milk has 3.5 percent milk fat. You are asked to compare the milk fat in 2 percent milk and that in whole milk. How much less milk fat, in terms of a percentage, does 2 percent milk have than whole milk?",,
34,Percentages and Milk Fat - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The midterm exam was given about four weeks after the initial assessment and intervention. The final exam was given about four weeks after the midterm. Between the midterm and final exams, the class further discussed the concepts and processes involved because of the persistence of misconceptions.",,
35,Percentages and Milk Fat - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The targeted class had 26 prospective teachers. On the midterm exam, two of them demonstrated full understanding of the problem; two others made very minor mistakes; the rest were still struggling with the problem structure, showing various versions of additive reasoning. The class revisited the structure of the problem situation from the perspectives of modeling, literacy, and additive/multiplicative reasoning. On the final exam, the same problem was used. Thirteen prospective teachers were able to demonstrate full understanding of the problem; five made minor mistakes; the rest fell back to an additive approach, showing little understanding of the problem. The persistence of rules and additive reasoning is not surprising, according to our teaching experiences and prior research findings (Newton 2008). Habits of mind, once established, can be resistant to change, leading to real emotional reactions on the part of the learners. However, we did observe a growing number of prospective teachers experimenting with new tools of sense making, such as meaningful labeling and model drawing. Figure 4 shows one prospective teacherâ€™s work on the final exam, which had plenty of evidence of sense making in the multiplicative dimension. Although the prospective teacher did not describe the specific meaning of 0.02 or 0.35 in her response, we felt that she understood the problem structure and its pedagogical aspects, drawing evidence from her sketches and flexible thinking.",,
36,Percentages and Milk Fat - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
37,Percentages and Milk Fat - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,PERCENTAGES: UNIQUE IN THE SYSTEM OF RATIONAL NUMBERS,,
38,Percentages and Milk Fat - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Percentages are quite unique mathematical objects in the system of rational numbers. They are ubiquitous in everyday life and used in a variety of scenarios. Yet their meanings are sensitive to the context, leading to numerous misconceptions for students. Percentages have therefore claimed a special role in new curricular conceptions. Moss (2005) suggests that percentages can be effectively used as a starting point in the teaching and learning of rational numbers. Bennett and Briggs (2011) discuss the uses and abuses of percentages in various real-world situations. Within the context of mathematics teacher education, we believe that the Milk Fat problem or similar real-world tasks may serve as a starting point to engage prospective teachers to reflect on their mathematical understandings and unlearn or relearn proportional reasoning to teach mathematics to young children (Ball 1988, 1990).",,
39,Percentages and Milk Fat - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Finally, we wish to make it clear that we value the diverse, albeit often mistaken, responses of our prospective teachers who have indicated emphatically that they wanted to teach students meaningful mathematics and to meet the demands of new state standards for mathematics and content area literacy (CCSSI 2010). However, a great many of them have been habitually bound to the rule-based perception of mathematics and a telling approach to mathematics teaching, which, no doubt, have come from their prior schooling and life experiences. Although there is no magic solution to fill the gaps, we recognize the critical importance of listening to the prospective teachers and capitalizing on the diverse knowledge that they bring to teacher education, including their misconceptions and unique perspectives. To a large extent, our findings confirm those of existing research in the domain of rational numbers (Lamon 2005; Ma 1999; Moss 2005), serving meanwhile as a call to further engage students in formative assessment as an essential component of intervention and instruction that can bridge the gap between research and practice in mathematics education.",,
