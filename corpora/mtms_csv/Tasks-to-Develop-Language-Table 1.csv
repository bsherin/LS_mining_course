Our work draws on the Common Core’s Standards for Mathematical Practices, the related Progression on Ratios and Proportional Relationships (University of Arizona 2011), and ideas found in Asian textbooks (Hironaka and Sugiyama 2007). We also build on the work of Lobato and Ellis (2010), who describe several “essential understandings” that learners should have regarding ratios. These key concepts include the idea  that ratios such as 1:4 can be thought of as— composed units: For every 1 unit of one quantity, there are 4 units of the other quantity; or  •  multiplicative comparisons: There are 4 times as many units of the second quantity as the fi rst.

As with fractions, in which an underlying whole is implicit, ratio  rRatios and Proportional Relationships is one of fi ve content domains in the middle-grades section of the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSM) (CCSSI 2010).

12,Tasks to Develop Language for Ratio Relationships,"Multiplicative reasoning required to understand relationships in ratios is less intuitive than additive reasoning. To add to the confusion, the language employed to describe multiplicative relationships is often used imprecisely in everyday speech. For example, a person might inaccurately say of a 150 gram apple and a 450 gram pumpkin, “This pumpkin weighs three times more than that apple” or “The apple weighs three times less than the pumpkin.” These statements suggest some confusion between additive and multiplicative reasoning. The development of precise multiplicative language is critical in  understanding ratio relation-",12,Tasks to Develop Language for Ratio Relationships

During the discussion of Ribbon Task 2 (2 yards of red ribbon and 3 yards of blue ribbon), we pursue the idea of identifying the whole that is referred to in multiplicative comparisons. Many of the PSTs have found that creating a diagram can help with their thinking and support their explanations (see fig. 3). However, in this case, where neither quantity is a whole-number multiple of the other, adult and middle school learners may struggle to see or verbalize the multiplicative relationship.

Next, we pursue the reciprocal relationship between the two lengths by introducing the fraction 3/2 or 1 1/2. If PSTs raise that idea, we encourage them to share it with the whole group. If not, we ask, “Can we describe the multiplicative relationship between the two lengths by using a different fraction?” This time, the base for the comparison is the red ribbon.",32,Tasks to Develop Language for Ratio Relationships

By focusing on different referent units (the length of the blue ribbon versus the length of the red ribbon) in Ribbon Task 2, learners are reminded that a fraction is a fraction of something that must be specified. Ribbon Task 3 is assigned as homework. It continues to encourage work on multiplicative comparison language while extending fraction ideas developed in the first two tasks.",39,Tasks to Develop Language for Ratio Relationships
40,Tasks to Develop Language for Ratio Relationships,"Note several attributes of these  tasks and their orchestration. First, the selection of ribbon as the context elicits quite naturally a tape or strip diagram (CCSSI 2010; Cohen 2013). This model is widely used in Asian curricula because of its simplicity, flexibility, and generalizability, and its relation to the number line (Englard 2010; Watanabe, Takahashi, and Yoshida 2010; Kheong, Ramakrishnan, and Soon 2006).    1 yd. = 1/2 of the red ribbon",40,Tasks to Develop Language for Ratio Relationships

46,Tasks to Develop Language for Ratio Relationships,•  Iterate the unit fraction to name the new amount in terms of the whole (the red ribbon’s length is 2/3 the blue ribbon’s length).

49,Tasks to Develop Language for Ratio Relationships,"In a later activity, PSTs are asked to generate familiar contexts in which a 2:3 ratio could be used. As with our adult PSTs, having students in middlegrades classrooms discuss ratio contexts as a whole group provides an opportunity for the instructor to assess students’  prior knowledge of ratio notation and language. In the vignette in figure 6, the instructor (one of the authors) selects the context “2 boys to 3 girls” in a Boys-to-Girls Task to encourage discussion about how ratios and fractions are related and to support multiplicative language development. ",49,Tasks to Develop Language for Ratio Relationships
50,Tasks to Develop Language for Ratio Relationships,"Learning to use appropriate  language to clarify the connections between fractions and ratios is challenging. In figure 6, Alicia and Taylor struggle to use the fraction 2/3 to interpret the ratio 2:3 in a part:part context, instead converting to the part-whole fractions 2/5 and 3/5. Other students, such as David, choose part:whole ratios to make connections with fractions. Jacob returns to the boys:girls context, tentatively trying a unit rate by composing 1 girl with  2/3 of a boy. Although the “2/3 of a guy” query is rejected by Angela, interpreting this kind of language is important in making sense of rates like “2.1 children per family.” ",50,Tasks to Develop Language for Ratio Relationships
51,Tasks to Develop Language for Ratio Relationships,"At this early stage, the concept of a ratio as a multiplicative comparison focusing on numbers rather than objects is not yet clear to most (the number of boys is 2/3 the number of girls),  although this is the identical relationship that PSTs stated in earlier work on Ribbon Task 2.

66,Tasks to Develop Language for Ratio Relationships,"At this point in the discussion, the PSTs have revisited the ratio 2:3 and are beginning to use their diagrams to reveal the fraction 2/3. Alicia selects diagram 3 from figure 7a that shows the unit ratio equivalent to 2:3  (i.e., 2/3:1). This is a nice transition to using the fraction 2/3 to make meaning for the ratio 2:3. Note that the diagram and the accompanying language indicate that some learners conceptualize the ratio as a composed unit: There is 2/3 tablespoon of vinegar for every tablespoon of oil. However, a few PSTs are moving toward the more generalized multiplicative comparison: There is 2/3 as much vinegar as oil. For many, however, their part-whole meaning of a fraction is not compatible with a part:part ratio, in which the quantity of one value is taken as the base against which the second quantity is measured.",66,Tasks to Develop Language for Ratio Relationships

68,Tasks to Develop Language for Ratio Relationships,"Emphasizing connections among  language and diagrams supports a wider range of learners who can then flexibly use these two ways of describing ratios. Katie’s interpretation of the ratio 2:3 is the most generalizable because it works in describing ratios with discrete or continuous quantities, part:part or part:whole ratios, and  ratios (or rates) with like or unlike units.

103,Tasks to Develop Language for Ratio Relationships,"begin using less comfortable multiplicative language. The Boys-to-Girls Task creates opportunities to explore relationships between ratios and fractions, but it often provokes confl icting ideas of part-to-part ratios and partof-a-whole fractions as well as issues with fractions in discrete contexts. Student-generated diagrams for the Salad Dressing Task can help students develop multiplicative language with continuous quantities (oil and vinegar), which can then be transferred to discrete contexts, such as the scenario found in the Boys-to-Girls Task.

104,Tasks to Develop Language for Ratio Relationships,"We are continuing to attend closely to the language and diagrams produced by our students (PSTs) and to study the work of other researchers and developers of curricula for both children and adults. These steps help us to refi ne tasks to support future teachers in understanding ratio concepts and language they will need later for scaling, proportions, and probability. Ultimately, we want to strengthen teachers’ knowledge of the mathematics they will be teaching in their own classrooms. ",104,Tasks to Develop Language for Ratio Relationships
