0,Fostering Perseverance - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Sustaining engagement with a mathematics task is not a novel suggestion for effective mathematics teaching. Principles and Standards for School Mathematics (2000) specified that â€œstudents need to know that a challenging problem will take some time and that perseverance is an important aspect of the problem-solving process and of doing mathematicsâ€ (NCTM 2000, p. 186). Yet there is often an expectation in mathematics class that solutions should come quickly, and teachers work against a norm that has equated fast responses with proficiency in mathematics. The Common Coreâ€™s Standards for Mathematical Practice (SMP) (CCSSI 2010) have brought renewed attention to the importance of perseverance in mathematical problem solving. In this article, we offer a set of classroom practices that foster studentsâ€™ perseverance in problem solving.",,
1,Fostering Perseverance - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"For a seventh-grade classroom, a group of teachers (see the acknowledgment at the end) designed instructional moves to foster perseverance in a lesson. Students spent a full class period working on a single challenging problem that stumped everyone at first. In fact, at the outset, students seemed lost, and it might have been tempting for the teacher to step in and show students what to do. But this lesson, by design, provided time and structure for the students to arrive at solutions themselves. At several junctures along the way, students huddled excitedly in groups to share their progress, even though they were far from finding complete solutions. Through a series of carefully formulated questions and participation structures, students demonstrated perseverance and enthusiasm. This did not happen by accident.",,
2,Fostering Perseverance - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"With the goal of designing instruction to foster student perseverance, a group of teachers met multiple times to first choose a suitable mathematical task and then develop a lesson. In so doing, the teachers were anticipating studentsâ€™ strategies and responses as well as developing language for responses to support studentsâ€™ abilities to maintain â€œproductive struggleâ€ (Hiebert and Grouws 2007; NCTM 2014; Warshauer 2015) on a challenging problem. Our team of teachers and professional developers then observed one team member teach the lesson. They met together afterward, in a modified form of â€œlesson studyâ€ (Stigler and Hiebert 1999), to analyze how it went. Although qualities like perseverance are not built in a day, the lesson was designed to specify teacher moves that could be woven into daily instruction. Here we share five categories of those teaching moves from that lesson that constitute teachersâ€™ efforts to foster student perseverance in problem solving:",,
3,Fostering Perseverance - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,1. Selecting mathematical tasks that require and support perseverance,,
4,Fostering Perseverance - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"For this lesson, we considered features of a worthwhile task, as defined by the National Council of Supervisors of Mathematics (NCSM 2013). According to NCSM, a great taskâ€”",,
5,Fostering Perseverance - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,â€¢ revolves around an interesting problemâ€”offering several methods of solution;,,
6,Fostering Perseverance - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,â€¢ is directed at essential mathematical content as specified in the standards;,,
7,Fostering Perseverance - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,â€¢ requires examination and perseveranceâ€”challenging students;,,
8,Fostering Perseverance - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,â€¢ begs for discussionâ€”offering rich discourse on the mathematics involved;,,
9,Fostering Perseverance - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,â€¢ builds student understandingâ€”following a clear set of learning expectations; and,,
10,Fostering Perseverance - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,â€¢ warrants a summary look backâ€”providing reflection and extension opportunities.,,
11,Fostering Perseverance - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
12,Fostering Perseverance - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Teachers selected the Party Time problem (see fig. 1) as a good candidate for inviting seventh-grade studentsâ€™ perseverance in problem solving. They anticipated that this problem could not be solved quickly because it involved no computation and had little resemblance to other problems recently solved, so that students could not rely on a pattern from their prior work to solve it. This problem definitely was interesting for the students and, as you will see below, students had multiple ways of approaching the problem. This open-ended problem was also chosen for its potential for discussion and reflection. Perseverance can be developed only by using tasks that warrant perseverance. Task selection here was key.",,
13,Fostering Perseverance - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,2. Talking about strategies for problem solving,,
14,Fostering Perseverance - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Theresa Drauch taught the lesson, designed in collaboration with her colleagues, to her seventh-grade students. Throughout the lesson, she prompted students to talk about strategies that they might use to solve the problem, especially when they were stuck. When the problem was first distributed, a full four minutes passed before students attempted to write anything on their papers. After giving students some time to work on the problem, Drauch opened a discussion about the strategies they employed:",,
15,Fostering Perseverance - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
16,Fostering Perseverance - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,T: What strategy were you using?,,
17,Fostering Perseverance - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,S1: I made a list. [See fig. 2a.],,
18,Fostering Perseverance - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,S2: I constructed a table.,,
19,Fostering Perseverance - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,S3: I wrote down costumes with equals signs next to them. [See fig. 2b.],,
20,Fostering Perseverance - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,S4: I circled the challenging ones. [See fig. 2c.],,
21,Fostering Perseverance - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"T: Work on it again, use othersâ€™ strategies, and see if that will help you.",,
22,Fostering Perseverance - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"CCSSI (2010) states that students need to â€œmonitor and evaluate their progress and change course if necessaryâ€ (p. 6), and teachers designed supports to name and encourage this kind of experimentation. In an exit ticket, a student described how she changed strategies as she worked (see fig. 3).",,
23,Fostering Perseverance - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
24,Fostering Perseverance - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,3. Demarcating phases in the problem-solving process,,
25,Fostering Perseverance - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"This lesson unfolded in phases that Drauch delineated with questions, directives, and alternating participation structures. These demarcations slow down the problem-solving process and encourage perseverance by staving off the rush to obtain a solution, thus making patient, deliberative work the norm in solving a challenging problem.",,
26,Fostering Perseverance - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Students were prompted to talk about what they had figured out before they had complete solutions, and the teacher used language to signal the notion that problem solving takes time and that this work is valuable as one presses on toward a complete solution. Below are three different questions or directives that the teacher offered at different stages of the lesson:",,
27,Fostering Perseverance - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,â€¢  Share with someone near you something you discovered while you were working that really helped you and that you would use again.,,
28,Fostering Perseverance - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"â€¢ Describe one thing to your partner, but explain your thinking.",,
29,Fostering Perseverance - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,â€¢ Pair with someone who has a different strategy than yours and confer.,,
30,Fostering Perseverance - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Note that these directives explicitly prompt students to leverage the thinking of peers in solving this challenging problem. Other teacher moves affirm the time it takes to solve problems and the fact that dead ends are to be expected:,,
31,Fostering Perseverance - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,â€¢ What did you do when you got stuck?,,
32,Fostering Perseverance - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,â€¢ Where are you [in the process right now]?,,
33,Fostering Perseverance - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Teachers also segmented the flow of the lesson with alternating participation structures. As part of their lesson design, the teachers planned how much time would be devoted to each component of the lesson to ensure that all would be included. The lesson design began with individual work so that students could gather their thoughts on their own, signaling that each student was able to generate useful ideas for solving the problem. This notion is key to fostering perseverance. But teachers also allocated time following that segment of individual work time for students to confer in pairs, so that once they had a solution path on their own they could gain other ideas from a partner and help one another get â€œunstuck.â€ The next participation structure was group work, to expand the exchange of ideas among students. Finally, students participated in whole-class discussion, armed with ideas that had been fleshed out in the earlier participation structures. Although the teachers allotted a certain number of minutes for each segment, Drauch also had the latitude to change the participation structure when students needed to switch gearsâ€”if she sensed that many had run into a blind alley in their problem-solving efforts, or, conversely, when they discovered a useful tidbit that would aid in solving the problem.",,
34,Fostering Perseverance - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,4. Naming feelings attendant to problem solving,,
35,Fostering Perseverance - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The teacher in this lesson named feelings that were often attendant to problem solving, especially problem solving that demanded perseverance. She had students offer ways of managing some of those feelings.",,
36,Fostering Perseverance - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"T: How many of you got frustrated? [Many students raise their hands.] So, what did you do about that?",,
37,Fostering Perseverance - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,S1: I kept trying.,,
38,Fostering Perseverance - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,S2: I used SMP 4.,,
39,Fostering Perseverance - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,S3: I used SMP 1 and 6.,,
40,Fostering Perseverance - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,S4: I used SMP 8: looked for a pattern.,,
41,Fostering Perseverance - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,S5: I tried something different.,,
42,Fostering Perseverance - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"T: When we were solving a problem last week, a lot of students got frustrated along the way. What did people do about that?",,
43,Fostering Perseverance - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,S6: Keep trying.,,
44,Fostering Perseverance - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,S7: Try something different.,,
45,Fostering Perseverance - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Here the teacher has invoked prior experiences, and in response, students referenced the Standards for Mathematical Practice that helped them move forward. Copies of these standards hang from the ceiling around the room on laminated pages that students access frequently during class. Earlier in the school year, Drauch would cue students to reference the SMPs as they worked on various problems; by this time, later in the school year, students did so without prompting.",,
46,Fostering Perseverance - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Later, after students were directed to pair with someone who worked on the problem in a different way, the teacher gave voice to the feeling of discovery that comes during problem solving:",,
47,Fostering Perseverance - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,How many of you had that aha! moment and changed as a result of that conversation?,,
48,Fostering Perseverance - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,5. Narrating internal processes,,
49,Fostering Perseverance - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Related to naming feelings attendant to problem solving, the teacher narrated the internal processes in problem solving, which we think helps students self-regulate and stick with what can otherwise feel like an inefficient or unproductive use of time. The last category, naming feelings, concerns studentsâ€™ affective states. This category addresses the cognitive work of problem solving and helps students develop an awareness of that cognitive work by giving it voice. For example, the teacher asked, â€œWhat made you change your mind? Tell me something you learned from talking to people.â€ These prompts legitimate the internal processes that students experience when they work on mathematical problems and reinforce norms that it is OK to try something, abandon it, and then try something else, and it is expected that students learn from collaborating with others.",,
50,Fostering Perseverance - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,FOSTERING PERSEVERANCE,,
51,Fostering Perseverance - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The teachersâ€™ goal in this lesson was direct work on fostering perseverance. Accordingly, the script that teachers designed had no references to the content of the problem at all. Instead, the teacher talk focused on the metacognitive work involved for students to find solutions themselves and persevere in doing so. Class time was devoted to thinking and processing, and the teacherâ€™s role was to create and maintain the space for this. By the end of the lesson, all students had arrived at a solution, although they left class still debating between two variants that had been proposed. Because mathematical content played a secondary role, the exit ticket that teachers designed addressed facets of studentsâ€™ perseverance.",,
52,Fostering Perseverance - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
53,Fostering Perseverance - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Figure 4 shows a number of studentsâ€™ exit tickets that were handed out at the end of the lesson. We see students reflecting on feelings and how group work helped students persevere. These student comments link directly to the categories of teacher moves for fostering perseverance that we articulated earlier: making task selections, offering varied participation structures, making strategies explicit, giving voice to affective states, and narrating internal processes. Students were able to name specific problem-solving strategies (â€œI looked back and started all over, and then I got my answerâ€); the social exchanges occasioned by the varied participation structures were helpful to some students (â€œMy friends wouldnâ€™t let me give upâ€). The attention to affective states allowed others to keep at it (â€œI got really frustrated, but I calmed down and got itâ€). We can imagine using a version of this lesson early in the school year as part of an effort to establish a classroom culture that values productive struggle, and using the questions in the Teaching Tips (see fig. 5) to sustain these norms throughout the school year.",,
54,Fostering Perseverance - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
55,Fostering Perseverance - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The widespread consensus is that making sense of problems and persevering in solving them (CCSSI 2010, p. 6) is crucial for studentsâ€™ proficiency in mathematics. But this disposition does not take root and grow on its own. Teachers themselves have to persevere in enacting instructional moves that cultivate perseverance in their students.",,
