"grade classroom, we immediately noticed the students talking about mathematics and their teacher listening to them. Wilson had spent the first weeks of the school year establishing classroom social norms with his students, which included notions of community and communication (NCTM 2000). He understood that for his classroom to become an interactive community of listeners and learners, the students would need to reconsider and modify many of their preconceived notions about what typically happens in mathematics classes. To create an interactive learning environment that would stimulate and perpetuate discourse (Yackel 1995), Wilson discussed two main issues with his students:  would do in small groups 2.

"Small-Group Work It was critical that Wilson’s students understood that his role in the classroom was that of facilitator and listener rather than explainer or mediator. Students were asked to consider taking on interactive roles. They were organized into pairs and expected to work together by assisting with the problem, listening intently, sharing their ideas, and explaining their problem-solving strategies.",6,mtms2012-04-558a,,

"Marquetry is a technique in which pieces of different types of wood are inlaid into the surface of a piece of furniture to create a design. One popular design often used to decorate tabletops is the Greek Cross design made from cubes of wood of varying colors. This type of design is not only interesting to look at, but is also full of hidden patterns. Can you find them? Using Snap Cubes to represent the cubes of wood, work with a partner to build the Greek Cross designs shown. Use only two colors for your designs, alternating colors as you build each larger design.",9,mtms2012-04-558a,,

"In Wilson’s classroom, thirty desks are aligned in a traditional row arrangement, and a graphing calculator is attached to each student desk with Velcro®. Along the back wall of the classroom are found a wide variety of manipulatives, such as Snap Cubes®, tangrams, pattern blocks, algebra tiles, color counters, protractors, color tiles, graph paper, rulers, 1 cm cubes, and  1 inch cubes, and so on, that are stored ",16,mtms2012-04-558a,,

Thus, students anticipated disagreements, arguments, and frustration. Wilson described these learning situations as argumentation (Krummheuer 1995) and forewarned students that he would not be intervening; instead, he encouraged students to resolve their disagreements and come to mutual agreement as long as the discourse remained civil and respectful.",18,mtms2012-04-558a,,
Whole-Class Discussion,19,mtms2012-04-558a,,
"The focus during this interaction phase was on having students explain how they found their answers and how they reasoned—not just the answers themselves. Wilson’s role as listener focused on student discourse rather than validating and evaluating correct or incorrect answers. Moreover, students needed to take on interactive roles to stimulate discourse.",20,mtms2012-04-558a,,

"The intricacies of the Greek Cross activity supported problem solving, interaction, and communication. Wilson chose the task (see fig. 1) because it required students to use tools to create models (Lesh and Doerr 2000), to analyze the figures at various stages in the growth cycle, and to find patterns.

"answering the question, Wilson asked the class if students thought it would be helpful to build additional designs. Many agreed that extras would help in the search for patterns. When the groundwork questions were resolved, one student, Ron, left his seat and retrieved a bucket of Snap Cubes while most of the other students turned their desks to face their partners. Several students had gone to the front of the room to get a closer look at the Greek Cross task that was still being projected on the interactive whiteboard. During this stage of problem solving, there was a synergetic buzz around the room that can only be described as discourse—the sound of doing math.",25,mtms2012-04-558a,,
Discussions around Patterns Found,26,mtms2012-04-558a,,
"Allie and Jennifer filled their chart with data that they had gathered by examining the first three iterations of the Greek Cross (see fig. 2). Their strategy was to analyze their data, looking for patterns to help them make a conjecture about how many cubes they would need to make the next iteration of the Greek Cross— without actually using more Snap Cubes. Although a few groups used colored pencils and graph paper to draw pictures of the iterations, most pairs used Snap Cubes to build their Greek Cross models. ",27,mtms2012-04-558a,,
"For example, Anar and Kelly built models of the first seven iterations of the Greek Cross, then analyzed the data that they had placed in a table. Anar suggested that they would find all the odd numbers squared in the number of white cubes; Kelly added that the green numbers were the even square numbers (see fig. 3). Both students agreed that this information would help them get to steps 8, 9, and 10 without building more models. Anar stated, “I think we can add the number of white and the number of green and get the total,” and Kelly agreed. They made a conjecture about stage 8 numbers and then built the model to determine if they were correct.",28,mtms2012-04-558a,,
"During this phase of small-group work, Wilson circulated around the room observing and listening to the students as they discussed the emerging patterns. On occasion, he would stop and join a pair of students. To engage in or stimulate the mathematical discourse, Wilson infused the interaction with questions that would require student reflection.",29,mtms2012-04-558a,,
"Allen and Rick, in the far-back corner of the room, were locked in  conversation. From Wilson’s observations, it appeared that Allen and Rick had noticed the same patterns as Anar and Kelly and had made similar conjectures (see fig. 4). However, they had found another pattern emerging in the total number of cubes. To determine if the boys had found another pattern, Wilson approached them and asked them to explain what they had found thus far. This type of question required the students to verbalize their thinking so that someone else could understand their process.",30,mtms2012-04-558a,,
"As they shared their thoughts,  Wilson continued to probe by asking how they thought the patterns they noticed will help them with the total number of cubes at the next stage. Through this conversation, the boys recognized that they had found a pattern that was not simply “plus 4 each time” but rather “plus 4 then plus 4 plus 4 more, and so on.” Rick expressed his thinking by stating, “Plus 4 each time but by 4 more each time. Not just plus 4, plus 4, plus 4. It’s plus 4, then plus 4 and 4 more.” Allen responded, “Like multiples of 4 or something.” The students continued ",31,mtms2012-04-558a,,

Discussions around Generalizing,35,mtms2012-04-558a,,
"The mathematical discourse that was initiated during the data collection portion of this task was sustained as the groups transitioned to generalizing an explicit rule for the nth term total number of blocks. At this point, many groups had begun to discuss the idea that the total number of lightcolored blocks combined with the total number of dark-colored blocks at any stage in the sequence was the total number of blocks. Most students spent a considerable amount of class time discussing how they might use this information to help them find a rule for the total number of blocks for the nth term. This discussion ensued:",36,mtms2012-04-558a,,
Meg: We have our green blocks [o for outside color] and the red blocks [c for other color; see fig. 5]. So we know that we have x2 = o for the green and (x – 1)2 = c for the red. Maybe we can put those together or something.,37,mtms2012-04-558a,,
Amanda: We could add them together  and see what we get. Do we need  to foil that one first? [Referring to the (x – 1)2 = c],38,mtms2012-04-558a,,
Meg: Yeah; (x – 1) × (x – 1) gives us  x2 – 2x + 1 = c. So that is what we get for the other color. ,39,mtms2012-04-558a,,
"Amanda: Okay, so if o + c = T, then   we can take c + x2 gives us  2x2 – 2x + 1 = T.",40,mtms2012-04-558a,,
Amanda: We better check our work.  [She picked up the graphing calculator on her desk.] So y1 is going to be x2 . . . and y2 = x2 – 2x + 1?,41,mtms2012-04-558a,,
Meg: Why don’t you just put the rule  in for the total? [She pointed to the 2x2 – 2x + 1.],42,mtms2012-04-558a,,
"Most of the other groups in Wilson’s class interacted in a similar way, discussing how best to use the patterns they had found by analyzing their data to help them determine the nth term rule for the total number of blocks. Jeff, Shane, and Zane’s group examined the data similarly but ultimately worked with the number totals for the red and green blocks rather than an nth term rule for both those data columns to determine the total (see fig. 6).",43,mtms2012-04-558a,,
"Students searched for patterns, conjectured about how those patterns would help them determine the explicit rule for the nth term of the Greek Cross, and tested their conjectures. Throughout this process, a necessary component of accomplishing the task was the mathematical discourse between the students and Wilson. The community of learners had spent most of the class period engaged in discourse as they explored and analyzed the Greek Cross.",44,mtms2012-04-558a,,
"Whole-class presentations took place the next day. During the presentations, groups shared their work (charts, models, and so on) using the interactive whiteboard. Since many groups had analyzed the patterns within the data in similar ways, they generalized a rule to determine the nth term rule similarly. To view different perspectives, Wilson selected groups to make presentations to ensure that various methods could be shared, examined, and discussed. These presentations provided an opportunity for student thinking to  be challenged since students were frequently confronted with ideas related to or aspects of the task that they may not have considered. Listening to other students explain their reasoning and understanding has the potential to further develop students’ mathematical understanding.",45,mtms2012-04-558a,,

"Selecting tasks that warrant discussion is an important aspect of sustaining mathematical discourse in and among students (Lampert 2001). Given Wilson’s desire to maintain and support a problem-centered learning environment (Wheatley 1999) in his classroom, task selection was incredibly important. Over the years, Wilson had collected good problem-solving tasks that required students to think and reason and that could be used later while students were collaborating and discussing the mathematics that they were working to understand and develop. However, selecting good tasks alone will not necessarily create a space in which mathematical discourse will emerge. We believe the teacher must transform his or her role in the classroom to that of one who talks less and listens more, facilitates rather than dictates, and works along with and guides students.

"Throughout this class period, ",48,mtms2012-04-558a,,
"Wilson spoke very little. When he did speak, he was usually asking questions. He rarely used what would be referred to as direct instruction. Instead, he negotiated with students, provided them with a worthwhile task, and allowed them to collaborate to solve problems while he moved around the room listening and asking questions. In this way, he helped sustain the mathematical discourse in his classroom with and among his students. His role was transformed to one  who presented worthwhile and engaging mathematical tasks, asked questions to encourage further discourse  a sizeable model of the Greek cross can be used to test conjectures on large values of n.",49,mtms2012-04-558a,,
