"The MTMS Word Problem tThe Editorial Panel of Mathematics Teaching in the Middle School (MTMS) is proud of the journal that we publish. The biannual readership survey reveals that our readers overwhelmingly ﬁ nd value in the articles and departments we publish. We also know that our readers are loyal and engaged. However, we continue to ask ourselves, ",1,mtms2013-04-460a,,
How can we do better? ,2,mtms2013-04-460a,,
WHAT’S IN A NAME?,3,mtms2013-04-460a,,
"Twenty years ago when MTMS was being developed, there were nationwide conversations about the terms middle school and junior high school. Those conversations are less frequent,  and we believe that the journal serving middle-level mathematics educators could better serve the mathematics education community without mention of a designated level. We suspect that the name Mathematics Teaching in the Middle School may be limiting our appeal. Anecdotally, we have been told that the content of MTMS is useful to many educators other than those who teach middle school mathematics. Just as Mathematics Teacher and Teaching Children Mathematics are descriptive without using the labels “high school” or “elementary school,” MTMS might better serve a wider range of educators without the words “middle school” in the nameplate.",4,mtms2013-04-460a,,

"Standards for Mathematics attempts to standardize the learning continuum and benchmarks, but we know that schools, teachers, and students are not uniform. Not all students learn the same material at the same pace. Not all schools and districts adhere to the same curriculum and teach the same content at each grade. Many teachers remediate and ﬁ nd themselves discussing middle school topics in a high school class. Other teachers explore algebra and geometry, topics often considered in grades 5 through 9, in an elementary school building. Many educators who do not identify themselves as middle school teachers can beneﬁ t from the information contained in MTMS.",6,mtms2013-04-460a,,
"Many of us remember when the NCTM school journals were positioned on a wall rack in the library. The journals Mathematics Teacher and Mathematics Teaching in the Middle School sat alongside each other in the display. Now journals are positioned on a phone, tablet, or computer and accessed through search engines and key words. Therefore, we believe that the time has come for MTMS to reconsider its name.",7,mtms2013-04-460a,,
WHAT IS THE MTMS WORD PROBLEM?,8,mtms2013-04-460a,,
The problem we are asking readers to solve is this:   Which word or words should be used in a new journal title?,9,mtms2013-04-460a,,
"To that end, the MTMS Editorial ",10,mtms2013-04-460a,,
"Panel would like to involve readers and others within the greater mathematics education community by holding a contest to select a new name. We know that the MTMS audience is clever and involved, so we would like to hear from you. You will ﬁ nd the speciﬁ cs for the contest below and at this site: www.nctm.org/mtmswordproblem",11,mtms2013-04-460a,,
"We are pleased to involve you in the process of renaming Mathematics Teaching in the Middle School and are looking forward to your suggestions. But most of all, we can’t wait to have a new name for the journal!",12,mtms2013-04-460a,,

"Just as Mathematics Teacher and Teaching Children Mathematics are descriptive without  using the labels “high school” or “elementary school,” MTMS might better serve a wider range of educators without the words “middle school.” What better source for a new title than our readers? Get creative, and send us your favorite names. The rationale of the Editorial Panel and more information are available online at www.nctm.org/mtmswordproblem.",16,mtms2013-04-460a,,
"Submit your most creative names through www.nctm.org/mtmswordproblem by May 15,  2013. The Editorial Panel will select four to six choices that will be voted on by MTMS readers in September 2013. The most popular name will be presented to the NCTM Board of Directors. Those who submitted the four to six nominated names will each win a $50 gift certiﬁ cate to the NCTM bookstore. The individual who submits the winning entry will receive an iPad® and will be featured in the ﬁ rst issue of the newly named journal in August 2014. ",17,mtms2013-04-460a,,
