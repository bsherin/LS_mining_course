"This department shares creative solutions to the problems in “Solve It!” articles, which appear a few times a year in MTMS. Classroom teachers can send their students’ work along with sufﬁ cient information to follow their students’ thinking. Send manuscripts to edward s.

"In the video game Cat and Mouse, you receive 4 points for each cat caught and 11 points for each mouse caught. What scores are impossible to get in this game?  extension: What pattern do you see in the impossible scores? several strategies to solve this problem. ",5,mtms2010-10-136a,,
"In so doing, they typically used  sStudents successfully chased down  trial and error to find the impossible scores. Madison, a student at Schoolcraft Middle School, listed the integers from 0 to 100, crossing off the scores that were possible (see  fig. 1). Nathan, a student at the  Hilliard City Schools, used a more systematic approach. He listed the multiples of 4 and 11 from 1 to 50. He then added 11 to each multiple of 4 in the list and added 4 to each multiple of 11 in the list. He then added another 4 or 11 to the new sums until he found four consecutive integers—30, 31, 32, and 33. He explained that once the four integers were found, he could stop finding possible scores because repeatedly adding 4 to each of the numbers would create new sets of four integers (see fig. 2).

"Some students found very interesting patterns related to the impossible scores. Several students, including Ali, from Briarcrest Christian School, looked at the sequence of integers, starting at 0, to determine the number of consecutive possible or impossible scores in the sequence. Starting at 0, there were 1 possible score, 3 impossible scores, 1 possible, 3 impossible, 1 possible, and so one. She found a symmetrical pattern in this list (see fig. 3). ",9,mtms2010-10-136a,,
"Taryn, another student at Briar- crest Christian School, focused on the sequence of impossible scores. She found that it started with two sets of 3 consecutive impossible scores, followed by three sets of 2 consecutive impossible scores, and then three sets of 1 impossible score (see fig. 4). Renée, a student at the Hilliard City Schools, went on to see that this sequence was the reverse of the sequence for possible scores, which consisted of three sets of 1 possible ",10,mtms2010-10-136a,,

"score followed by three sets of 2 consecutive possible scores, then two sets of 3 consecutive possible scores. She also examined the difference between each consecutive impossible score and found that the resulting differences were 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 4, and 4. She then noticed that 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 and 1 + 3 = 4 and that the sequence of differences changed each time a multiple of 11 was crossed off. The 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2 sequence occurred with impossible scores less than 11. The 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3 sequence occurred with impossible scores less than 22. ",18,mtms2010-10-136a,,
"Aina, another student at the ",19,mtms2010-10-136a,,
"Hilliard City Schools, also found a fascinating pattern in looking at the impossible scores. She found that if she started with 1 and continually added 4 until she reached a multiple of 11, all the sums less than the multiple of 11 would be impossible. Similarly, the same thing occurred with 2 and 3. She then would have all the impossible scores for this problem (see fi g. 5). ",20,mtms2010-10-136a,,
"Overall, we were impressed with  the discoveries that students made by looking at the impossible scores.",21,mtms2010-10-136a,,
Students can continue to look for patterns as well as make and explore several conjectures by trying to determine what will happen if the point values change. What scores are impossible if you get 9 points for catching a cat instead of 4 points? Students can explore sets of point values for both a fi nite set and an infi nite set of impossible scores. ,22,mtms2010-10-136a,,
