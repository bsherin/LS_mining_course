Getting and keeping the attention of an eighth-grade algebra class can often be a challenge. Doing so while trying to meet curriculum expectations and standards can be a daunting task unless projects are designed to both pique and maintain student curiosity. Projects designed around standards that initiate interest and have multiple entry points for students of different ability levels are a teacher’s best tool for building understanding. ,7,mtms2009-11-198a,,
"This project challenges students to become active participants as they study linear and quadratic functions. Students are engaged from the start as they take a hands-on approach exploring linear relationships, parabolic curves, and quadratic functions.",8,mtms2009-11-198a,,

Videos,10,mtms2009-11-198a,,
A number of excellent videos are available that describe the siege-warfare tactics used in medieval times. One in particular that is part of WGBN’s Nova series is Secrets of Lost Empires II—Medieval Siege (Barnes 2000). This video does an outstanding job of not only showing how a trebuchet was used but also how it was built. It includes discussions on the variables that influence the distance and arc of the projectile. The video explores modern-day craftsmen as they try to build two trebuchets and knock down the walls of a mock castle. ,11,mtms2009-11-198a,,
"Videos are available through online retailers or can be found in many  academic resource centers. If access to a video is not an option, students can be asked to research medieval warfare tactics to build interest and open up discussion.  inteRnet",12,mtms2009-11-198a,,
"Plans for constructing paper trebuchets are available online, as well as other plans for more ambitious but sturdy trebuchets. Some require only paper or card stock. Other online sources provide plans for constructing trebuchet in a wood shop.

"Principles and Standards for School Mathematics (NCTM 2000) states that students should “model and solve contextualized problems using various representations” as well as be able to “identify functions as linear or nonlinear and contrast their properties.” This project accomplishes these goals. Many states also have more specific standards on the application of linear and non- linear functions in real-world settings. A lesson on this standard might include looking at pictures of a cannon ball in motion or rocks being thrown off a cliff. This project, however, allows students to hurl a projectile in a controlled, safe environment and see the results.",21,mtms2009-11-198a,,
The trebuchet is the centerpiece of this project. Students will use a model trebuchet to hurl clay projectiles and analyze both the linear and parabolic functions relating to the path of the projectile.,22,mtms2009-11-198a,,
"The distance and path of an object  that is hurled by a trebuchet is governed by both linear and quadratic equations. From a fixed location, the horizontal distance that an object is thrown is a linear function of the amount of counterweights that have been added to the trebuchet. ",23,mtms2009-11-198a,,
"Once an object has been launched, the path the object follows through the air approximates a parabolic curve in which the height is a function of the object’s distance from the trebuchet. Students have a hands-on opportunity to study the linear function effects of adjusting counterweights and the quadratic function of the projectile’s parabolic path.",24,mtms2009-11-198a,,
"In this project, students work in  teams to hurl marble-sized wads of clay using a small trebuchet. In the first of two explorations, they explore a linear relationship by slowly increasing the amount of the counterweight and measuring the distance of the clay projectile. In theory, the more counterweight, the greater the distance. ",25,mtms2009-11-198a,,
"In the second exploration, they study the parabolic arc of the projectile as it flies from the trebuchet to the point of impact. By aiming the trebuchet at a wall, using a fixed counterweight, and then slowly pulling the trebuchet back after each subsequent throw, students collect data to plot a graph of the height at which the projectile hits the wall versus the distance of the trebuchet from the wall. The result is a nice parabolic curve and an “a-ha!” moment.",26,mtms2009-11-198a,,

"During medieval times, if a castle could not be stormed directly and the occupants refused to surrender, attacking armies would use giant trebuchets, similar to catapults, to hurl stones at the castle walls from a distance safe from arrows and lances. They also employed early forms of biological warfare by hurling animal carcasses over the walls to spread disease and pestilence (Park 1992). Once the walls were breeched, the invading armies could storm the castle.  the PRoJect",29,mtms2009-11-198a,,

One person loads and fires by  cocking, loading, and releasing the trebuchet.  2.  One or two students measure the  distance or height of the throw.  3.  A third person records the   measurements.

"Students rotate through the roles, giving everyone a chance to work on each aspect of the assignment. ",31,mtms2009-11-198a,,

"1. Setting the Stage This opening part serves to motivate students and identify the goals of the project, which by its very nature generates motivation. Building enthusiasm ensures that there is total commitment when the project begins. Setting goals will help the students get the most out of the project.  2. Recording Data and Examining the Linear Relationship",46,mtms2009-11-198a,,
Project teams work with the linear relationship between the amount of counter weight (the independent variable) and the distance the clay projectile is thrown (the dependent variable) by the trebuchet. Discuss the questions that follow with the class: •	 Why	is	the	counterweight	the	 independent variable?  have the same number of weights but different weights of clay? ,47,mtms2009-11-198a,,
"It is important to know ahead of time how much space each team will need, the number of counterweights to begin with, and the increments by which to increase the weight with each throw. Knowing the behavior of the trebuchet beforehand determines these parameters. After staking out an area where the groups can work, students begin with the lowest weight and build incrementally with each subsequent throw. ",48,mtms2009-11-198a,,
"Because considerable discrepancy  can occur in the distance of the throws, students should make three throws at each counter-weight amount. By averaging three throws at each weight, the students will get more reliable data. A set of six data points is a reasonable number with which to work.  •	 Why	is	the	distance	the	dependent	",49,mtms2009-11-198a,,
"Students record the data in a table,  variable?  •	 Does	the	weight	of	the	clay	ball	 matter?  •	 What	happens	if	two	trebuchets	 determine average distances, and write (x, y) coordinate pairs of the weight (x) and the distance (y). Next, students plot these ordered pairs on  a coordinate plane. Figure 1 contains a sequence of questions for students. Invariably, the plotted points do not form a perfectly straight line. Students will need to draw a line of best fit through the points on their graph. This line of best fit approximates a linear function from the recorded data. Students should be reminded that it is not a requirement that the line of best fit go through actual plotted points on the graph, but it may.",50,mtms2009-11-198a,,
"Students generate an equation of their line of best fit in slope-intercept form (y = mx + b). They start by calculating the slope of the line (m). Students pick two points on the line of best fit and use the equation for slope, which is ",51,mtms2009-11-198a,,
"Then they find the y-intercept (b). This should be zero, given that the trebuchet will not throw the clay without any weight. This is an important point to discuss in the context of the project. With the intercept (b) and the slope (m), they complete the slopeintercept equation for the line of best fit. To check their work, students can use linear-regression software available on many graphing calculators.  3. Exploring the Quadratic Relationship Students now investigate the quadratic relationship between the distance of the trebuchet from a wall (the independent variable) and the height at which the clay projectile strikes the wall (the dependent variable). Students will need to pick a fixed counter weight for this part of the project. ",52,mtms2009-11-198a,,
"The trebuchet is placed up against,  and aimed at, a wall or other vertical surface. Students fling the clay and record how high on the wall the clay hits. Students then move the trebuchet away from the wall in fixed increments  and continue recording data. Generally, the height that the clay projectile hits the wall will increase for the first few throws, then begin to go down until the clay hits the ground before it reaches the wall. As in the first experiment, students make three throws and average them for each data point.",53,mtms2009-11-198a,,
"The students record the data on an  activity sheet similar to the first. On this sheet, they will record the height of the projectile against the distance from the wall. Figure 2 shows the sequence of questions for students. The height is the dependent variable (y), and the distance from the wall is the independent variable (x). Graphing and connecting the ordered pairs (x, y) with a line of best fit should result in a parabolic curve.",54,mtms2009-11-198a,,
"The groups now generate a  quadratic equation (y = ax2 + bx + c) for the parabolic curve on a separate graph. From the graph, students can estimate the highest point, or vertex, of the parabola. The vertex provides a known point (x1, y1) on the graph. They can also use the graph to deter-",55,mtms2009-11-198a,,

"The students now have two equations in which a and b are the only unknowns. By solving a system of equations, the a and b values can be calculated. The teams now have the a, b, and c values to complete the quadratic equation of the parabolic curve. To check their work, teams can use quadratic-regression software available on many graphing calculators.  4. Testing Predictions",67,mtms2009-11-198a,,
"Students put their knowledge to the test in this part of the project. They lay siege to a domino-castle and try to knock down the domino walls. Students must use everything they learned in the first two experiments, applying the equations they have developed to describe the behavior of their trebuchet. ",68,mtms2009-11-198a,,
"Set aside a siege area: One end will  be the trebuchet launching area and the other end will have a dominocastle wall. The domino wall is five tiles high and ten tiles wide. Between the castle and the trebuchet, place a cardboard barrier about two feet wide and one foot high. The object is for ",69,mtms2009-11-198a,,
"Fig. 3. after students have calculated the path of a hurled object with their trebuchet, they can set up a structure behind a wall and test their predictions.  the students to launch a projectile over the barrier and knock down the domino-castle wall. A house of cards is an option if dominos are not available (see fig. 3).  ",70,mtms2009-11-198a,,
"To be successful, groups must  consider the distance and the arc of the projectile. The groups first consider the distance to the domino-castle. Using the linear function from part 2 of the project, they calculate an independent value (weight) for a given dependent value (distance). With the counterweight calculated, students determine if the projectile will have sufficient loft to clear the cardboard barrier. Using the quadratic function from part 3, teams estimate the loft (y) for the distance to the barrier (x). Give students time to calibrate their trebuchets to the conditions of the siege. Each group gets three tries to knock down the domino wall. This is an exciting part of the project for the students, and the teams cheer for one another.  5. Summarizing and Sharing",71,mtms2009-11-198a,,
"To conclude, students package their findings into a single report, which includes data sheets, graphs, and a final analysis that summarizes the mathematics learned. Through their writing, students have the opportunity to show that the project helped solidify  their knowledge of linear and nonlinear equations. Specifically, students should be able to address the effect of independent variable change on the dependent variable outcome. Students display a greater appreciation of the underlying concepts than that gained by rote memorization of the formulas.",72,mtms2009-11-198a,,
"Bring the class together for a final group discussion. Although students want to talk about how much fun they had, it is important to steer the conversation toward the learning that occurred. Give them an opportunity to discuss how the project applied to the original goals presented in the beginning. They can display their findings on poster board, with PowerPoint presentations, and on overhead-projector transparencies. Post the topics for discussion such as the parameters that affect the path of the projectile both linearly and nonlinearly, how those parameters are manifested in the equations, or how influences outside their control affected the outcomes. This presents an opportunity to coordinate results with science class colleagues.  conclUsion",73,mtms2009-11-198a,,
"The end result of this project is that students have an opportunity to actively engage in the application and use of several algebra standards. By doing so,  they are able to construct new understanding by building on and extending their prior knowledge (NCTM 1991). This single project allows students to work with linear and parabolic functions, measurement, effects of independent variable change on dependent outcome, and concept application. ",74,mtms2009-11-198a,,
"For many students, algebra can be, by its very nature, a dry subject without activities and projects that build interest and excitement. Throwing some math around in projects such as this allows walls of understanding to be built. It also helps breathe life into a math class, while meeting criteria for which teachers are held accountable. ",75,mtms2009-11-198a,,
