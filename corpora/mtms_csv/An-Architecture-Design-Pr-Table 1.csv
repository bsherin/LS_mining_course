In this project, through the context of an architecture investigation, seventh-grade students engaged in mathematics involving area, surface area, volume, ratios and proportional thinking, number sense, and technology integration. Students, working in mixed-ability groups, were given an occupant scenario, which they used to build a home designed to meet the needs of their unique residents. After initial drawings of plans followed by critiques from a practicing architect, they finalized designs and carried out  mathematical tasks related to their plans. As a culminating event, student groups presented their home plans to local stakeholders, including peers, an architect who designed the school building, the district’s mathematics curriculum specialist, and teachers from the school, who provided valuable feedback. Throughout the project, students completed a math log to record their mathematical thinking. Our project was tested in two seventh-grade classes taught by one of the authors.

Students were challenged by how to handle the “extra inches” in the calculations of square feet. When a measure was 18 ft. 10 in. by 23 ft. 11 in., they realized after discussion that finding the area was made easier by converting those measures to decimals.

32,An Architecture Design Project: Building Understanding,"For two days, student groups finetuned their original paper-and-pencil designs using SketchUp® (2016) software to simulate the authentic work of an architect. Students reviewed several tutorials about SketchUp to help them understand how to effectively use such features as the dimension tool (find tutorials under the SketchUp website’s Learn tab). Groups’ SketchUp designs were based on the best ideas from each individual sketch. At the end of these two days, student group designs were sent electronically to the architect, who then provided written feedback to strengthen their final home designs (see fig. 5). SketchUp is free software that can be downloaded onto either Windows® or Mac®. Teachers may also wish to explore other free software, including  GeoGebra or  Tinkercad™ design software. Although creating the group designs by using software that helps students visualize the house three dimensionally has many advantages, this project can be completed effectively with group designs constructed using paper and pencil.

Therefore, students were also responsible for completing questions 3–6 in their math logs. Question 3 sparked the most interesting discussions. Some groups had difficulty recalling the meaning of surface area, which provided an opportunity to review this key concept. For some groups, we brought out a threedimensional (3D) solid of a rectangular prism and asked students to imagine it as a bedroom: “What parts of this figure would we need to paint if we were painting the walls and ceiling?” and “How could you determine how much paint you need?” Although some students immediately wanted to use the traditional algorithm for finding surface area, instead, we asked students to consider “What makes sense?” as highlighted in the following typical discussion:",33,An Architecture Design Project: Building Understanding

While calculating the surface area of the bedrooms, students referred to the original list of constraints and started to panic, thinking that because their surface area was more than 2000 square feet that they had exceeded the constraint of 2000 square feet ± 20 percent  for the house.

Architect feedback was in the form of general considerations for design, in every case resulting in students improving their home design through multiple iterations. For example, one group received feedback about their kitchen being only about six feet wide. After we prompted this group to get a yardstick and measure six feet, they quickly realized that this measurement “won’t work because you need enough space for counters, an oven, and to walk through past someone.” Architect feedback also focused on design and proportional thinking (see fig. 8), causing students to reconsider and improve some of their previous responses in their math logs.
