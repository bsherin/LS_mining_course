1,Throw in the Towel - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"1. a. Write an equation for Odieâ€™s total sales selling kisses, in which x is the number of kisses sold and y is the amount of money earned.",,
2,Throw in the Towel - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,b. Write an equation to show the total sales for Garfield. Let x represent the number of towels sold and y the amount of money earned.,,
3,Throw in the Towel - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"2. a. If Odie has $50.00 in total sales, how many towels would Garfield have to sell to have the same total sales?",,
4,Throw in the Towel - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,b. Suppose Odie sells four times as many kisses as Garfield sells towels. Whose total sales would be greater? How many times as great?,,
5,Throw in the Towel - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"For problems 3â€“5, assume that the wholesale cost per towel is $0.75 (the amount that Garfield must spend to buy each towel), and Odieâ€™s cost per kiss given is $0.00.",,
6,Throw in the Towel - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,3. Suppose that Odie sells 30 kisses and Garfield sells 25 towels. Whose profit is greater? How much greater?,,
7,Throw in the Towel - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,4. Odie and Garfield decide to go into business together.,,
8,Throw in the Towel - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"a. They offer customers the following deal: â€œBuy 2 kisses, and we throw in the towel for free.â€ How much profit will they make if 40 customers each buy 2 kisses?",,
9,Throw in the Towel - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"b. Odie and Garfield decide to offer the following deal to improve profits: â€œBuy 1 towel, and we give you 2 kisses for free.â€ Will this deal make them more profit per customer than the deal in part (a)? Explain.",,
10,Throw in the Towel - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,5. Odie and Garfield decide to offer customers a choice of two possible deals:,,
11,Throw in the Towel - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Option 1: â€œBuy 5 kisses, and we throw in the towel for free.â€",,
12,Throw in the Towel - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Option 2: â€œBuy 3 kisses, and you get the towel for $1.00.â€",,
13,Throw in the Towel - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Suppose 23 customers purchase Option 1. How many customers would have to purchase Option 2 before it produces a total profit that is greater than the Option 1 profit with 23 customers?,,

15,Throw in the Towel - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"1. a. 1x = y, or x = y",,
16,Throw in the Towel - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,b. 2x = y,,
17,Throw in the Towel - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,2. a. 25 towels; solve 2x = 50 for x; x = 25,,
18,Throw in the Towel - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"b. Odieâ€™s total sales would be twice as great as Garfieldâ€™s total sales. Sample explanation: Odie needs to sell twice as many kisses as Garfield sells towels for their total sales to be the same. If Odie sells four times as many kisses as Garfield sells towels, his total sales would be twice as great as Garfieldâ€™s total sales.",,
19,Throw in the Towel - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"3. Garfieldâ€™s profit would be greater by $1.25. Sample solution: For 30 kisses, Odie earned $1.00 â€¢ 30, or $30.00. Garfieldâ€™s profit per towel is $1.25 ($2.00 â€“ $0.75). Therefore, Garfield earned $1.25 â€¢ 25 = $31.25. Subtracting $30.00 from $31.25 yields $1.25.",,
20,Throw in the Towel - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"4. a. $50.00. Sample solution: For each sale, Garfield and Odie take in $2.00 but must pay $0.75 per towel. Therefore, their profit per customer is $1.25. With 40 customers, they will earn $1.25 â€¢ 40, or $50.00.",,
21,Throw in the Towel - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"b. No. They will make the same profit per customer as the other deal. For each customer, they take in $2.00 but pay $0.75 per towel, for a profit of $1.25 per towel.",,
22,Throw in the Towel - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"5. 31 customers. Sample solution: Under Option 1, Odie and Garfield make $4.25 profit per customer ($5.00 â€“ $0.75). For 23 customers, they earn $4.25 â€¢ 23 = $97.75 profit. Under Option 2, they make $3.25 profit per customer ($3.00 + $1.00 â€“ $0.75). To find how many customers it would take to make a profit of $97.75 based on a profit of $3.25 per customer, solve the equation 3.25x = $97.75. The solution is  x â‰ˆ 30.08. Because 30 customers would only result in $97.40 profit, the result must be rounded up to 31.",,
23,Throw in the Towel - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,FIELD-TEST COMMENTS,,
24,Throw in the Towel - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Garfieldâ€™s business sense was applauded by my sixth-grade prealgebra students, although they felt he should not team up with Odie because the dogâ€™s slobber was creating such a puddle!",,
25,Throw in the Towel - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Throughout the year, we have discussed various scenarios involving profit, wholesale versus retail pricing, as well as the cost of doing business. This scenario fit well into our conceptual review and even provided an opportunity to discuss the distributive property.",,
26,Throw in the Towel - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"As students were explaining their thinking in problems 3â€“5, several patterns emerged.",,
27,Throw in the Towel - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"For problem 3, many students calculated Garfieldâ€™s sales total and then subtracted $0.75 per towel to find the profit. Others figured out that each towel sale netted a profit of $1.25 and then multiplied to find the total profit. We wrote the two methods on the board and discussed that the distributive property was used by the first group of students and that the order of operations, solving the parentheses first, was used by the second group. When approaching problem 4, most students stated that the profit was $80.00 and said, â€œNo, wait, the towels still cost $0.75.â€ Rather than calculate the cost of the towels, another chimed in that â€œ25 percent of 40 is 10. So, the profit is $40.00 + $10.00 = $50.00.â€ The final problem allowed students to explore how much that extra dollar of profit really meant. Realizing that it would take an additional thirty-one customers, they recommended that Garfield and Odie stick with Option 1.",,

31,Throw in the Towel - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,I used the cartoon â€œThrow in the Towelâ€ with my eighth-grade pre-algebra students. Assigning this cartoon was an excellent way to introduce writing and solving equations from word problems because it took away the words and replaced them with a comic. I felt that this cartoon was an excellent addition to what we were studying in that it allowed the class to take math out of the textbook and apply it to something they could use in their everyday life. This is definitely a cartoon I will be saving to use in future years!,,

35,Throw in the Towel - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I tried this cartoon with my seventh-grade prealgebra class. We are just finishing a unit on equations, so the timing was perfect. My students were quickly able to write and solve the equations for questions 1a, 1b, and 2a. It was interesting to see the number of different ways that students solved question 2b.",,
36,Throw in the Towel - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Questions 3 through 5 posed more of a challenge. These questions might best be tackled within cooperative groups. For some seventh graders, the additional complexity of the cost per towel caused them to stop trying, and it was at this point that the real learning began. The challenge for teachers is how to encourage such productive struggle without giving away the answers. I did not let my students work in groups because I wanted to see what mistakes they would make. I found that some students did not know what to do with the towel cost, so they ignored it. While students worked on questions 4a and 4b, I reminded them that the towels still cost money even though the directions clearly stated â€œuse the cost per towel in questions 3â€“5.â€",,
37,Throw in the Towel - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Question 5 was the biggest challenge of all. It might be a good idea to give struggling students the hint of writing an equation for Option 1 and an equation for Option 2. After they complete that, they might be better able to deal with the remainder of the problem.",,
38,Throw in the Towel - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Since the cost of the towels was an issue with a number of my students throughout this question set, I would advise teachers to make sure you take the time to deal with it thoroughly in question 3, therefore giving students the best chance of being able to solve questions 4 and 5 correctly.",,
