17,Hes Got All the Answers,"This cartoon was used as a wholegroup discussion with gifted seventhgrade and eighth-grade students and with general education eighth-grade students during a study skills period. I was surprised how many students solved question 1 by providing twostep equations instead of word problems with two operations. These students were mostly eighth graders who advanced into algebra 1. None of my students were familiar with the empty set symbol, but surprisingly fifteen out of seventeen students answered the question correctly after a brief discussion about 0 not meaning the set is empty but containing a data value of 0. We had a lengthy discussion about the “teen years” and decades question, mostly because the students did not consider the age of 11 to be a “teen year.” In addition, my students wanted to stop at the 90s decade and concluded that there is not another decade with four prime numbers. They stated that the 100s starts a new century.",17,Hes Got All the Answers

23,Hes Got All the Answers,6. 42. A circle with a radius of 7 has a diameter of 14. A quick estimate for π is 3. Entering 3 for π and 14 for d in the formula C = πd produces C = 3(14). So C = 42. The other possible answers are not close to 42.,23,Hes Got All the Answers
24,Hes Got All the Answers,"I used “He’s Got All the Answers” following a test for each class. Since we were approaching the end of the school year and review time, I thought this would be a great assignment for the class to review skills previously learned. Students were asked to review the sheet and to complete it as best they could individually while others finished their assessments. Then students were asked to work with a partner and rationalize their answers. Were their answers similar or different? Why? ",24,Hes Got All the Answers
25,Hes Got All the Answers,"During the paired review of  answers, I circulated to listen to the discussions. All classes, including my inclusion class, resource class, and advanced classes, were engaged in great conversations using a variety of academic language. The students really enjoyed creating their own word problems for question 1 and enjoyed sharing them even more. Students showed creativity and used a lot of humor in their writing, which I found unexpected. They enjoyed it so much that I asked them to switch partners again to listen to others’ word problems. Then, when I asked for them to share with the class, they had to choose the ones they liked the best. It was great to see students use a variety of skills, such as taking the square root. One student even included scientific notation. ",25,Hes Got All the Answers
26,Hes Got All the Answers,"Many of my students had no idea what an empty set was for question 2. Nonetheless, they engaged in some very productive conversations and worked collaboratively to rule out C and D. Many had chosen E as an answer; however, for never being exposed to empty sets, they did very well coming to a conclusion using what they already knew and applying it to this question. Question 3 was a great review for students. Much discussion occurred while students tried to recall different properties. A lot of academic discourse involved such terms as associative  property, distributive property, and  commutative property. During the review of the answers, students in all classes were able to generate a description of each property and relatable words to help others understand the terms better. One student stated that the associative property meant grouping. He said, “When my mom says to not associate with someone, that means I can’t be part of their group.” Another student said that commutative means to move, like when his dad “commutes” to his job in another city each day; his path home is the opposite of his commute to work. ",26,Hes Got All the Answers
27,Hes Got All the Answers,"My advanced students did not  struggle at all with the first part of question 4, but they had some issues with  the second part. Many eventually figured it out, but there were many debates and explanations when we reviewed the answers. Students who understood how to identify multiples of 3 helped others identify them. Several classes of students worked together in pairs to review prime and composite definitions. Many had a harder time with (b) so I gave them extended time to work on it. I also assigned them decades when I saw that they were spending too much time on the problem. This activity helped them gain a better understanding because they started to notice patterns. ",27,Hes Got All the Answers
28,Hes Got All the Answers,"There was a lot of debate around question 5. By the time students got to this problem, many had noticed that the answers were at the top of the cartoon. Therefore, although they knew the answer, they still had to explain it. My advanced students who did not initially have the correct answer worked backward until they ",28,Hes Got All the Answers
29,Hes Got All the Answers,OTHER IDEAS,29,Hes Got All the Answers
30,Hes Got All the Answers,"Extend this Cartoon Corner with these ideas: •  Have students figure out which of the answers in the cartoon was not  used in some manner in this Cartoon Corner. (The answer is the triangle with sides labeled a, b, c.) •  Have students predict the number of items that they would expect to answer correctly by guessing each answer on a 20-item test that is—   1. a true-false test;   2. a multiple-choice test with four possible answers per item; and   3. a multiple-choice test with five possible answers per item.",30,Hes Got All the Answers

Students were trying to overthink question 5, with some reading it and interpreting what was needed to solve it. I liked this problem the best  perhaps because students were required to think and use a variety of skills that they struggle with, such as reading and comprehending a word problem.
