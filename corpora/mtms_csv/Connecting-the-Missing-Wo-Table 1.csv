It related to Kulbacki’s unit of instruction and could easily be adapted to a novel that was familiar to her sixth-grade students. Being mindful of the Mathematical Task Framework (Smith and Stein 1998) as a tool to sort tasks into four levels of cognitive demand, Kulbacki analyzed the value of the Missing Words task. According to the framework, tasks can be classified in the following ways: ",17,Connecting the Missing Words to the Common Core

Students would need to explore and understand the mathematical concepts, processes, and relationships among the measures of central tendency, measures of variability, and graphical displays of the data (Smith and Stein 1998).

She was confident that the mathematical reasoning and discussions that could occur about the concepts of variability and distribution of a data set would situate the students’ learning around the heart of the mathematical practices.  launching the task,32,Connecting the Missing Words to the Common Core
33,Connecting the Missing Words to the Common Core,The launch for this task required students to think about the measures of distribution and variability and apply  their conceptual understanding rather than just follow a procedure. Kulbacki asked her students to find (a) three sets of five data values that had a mean of 80 and (b) another set of five data values that had a mean of 80 and a median of 100. The students worked in small groups to find data for each condition.,33,Connecting the Missing Words to the Common Core
34,Connecting the Missing Words to the Common Core,"Some groups found the activity  more challenging than others. For example, finding a set of five data values with a mean of 80 could be 80, 80, 80, 80, and 80. However, the launch activity asked students to find three ",34,Connecting the Missing Words to the Common Core

One group of students decreased one value of 80 by 1 and added 1 to another 80 to fi nd 79, 80, 80, 80, and 81. They continued using repeated reasoning until they had 78, 79, 80, 81, and 82. Another group of students worked with multiples of ten to fi nd that 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100 had a mean of 80. ",35,Connecting the Missing Words to the Common Core
36,Connecting the Missing Words to the Common Core,"All the groups of students were a  bit stumped at fi rst when fi nding a set of fi ve data values with a mean of 80 and a median of 100. Kulbacki noticed that Abigail was simplifying the problem by using a set of fi ve values that had a mean of 8 and a median of 10. She asked Abigail to share her strategy with the class. Abigail wrote 8, 8, 8, 8, 8 on the front board and strategically added and subtracted values to balance the set of numbers and satisfy the conditions. Continuing in this manner, Abigail wrote:  8  8    8    8     8  6  8    8    8  10  4  8    8  10  10  2  8  10  10  10",36,Connecting the Missing Words to the Common Core
37,Connecting the Missing Words to the Common Core,"To return to the original problem of fi nding fi ve data values that have a mean of 80 and median of 100, Abigail realized she needed to multiply each number by 10. Kulbacki emphasized to the class how Abigail was making use of the mathematical structure when she subtracted 2 from the fi rst 8 and added it to the last 8 to keep the mean as 8. She also made the class aware of how Abigail simplifi ed the problem as her strategy to solve it. ",37,Connecting the Missing Words to the Common Core
38,Connecting the Missing Words to the Common Core,"Callie’s reasoning focused on knowing that to have a mean of  80, she needed the fi ve data values 80, she needed the fi ve data values to sum to 400. She also knew the middle value had to be 10. Callie created an equation, x + 100 = 400, and found that x = 300. After trial and error, she found 25, 25, 100, 100, and 150. Kulbacki asked Callie to share her strategy with the class, noting how she reasoned quantitatively and decomposed 300 into four addends, in which two of the addends were values less than or equal to 100 and the other two addends had values greater than or equal to 100. ",38,Connecting the Missing Words to the Common Core
39,Connecting the Missing Words to the Common Core,"Although Kulbacki was impressed with the reasoning demonstrated by students such as Abigail and Callie, she noticed that some were struggling with this concept. To ensure that they had a conceptual understanding of mean and median, she pulled up a virtual balance beam on the SMART Board™ and reviewed how the mean represented the value that balances the data set. She placed fi ve 80s on the balance beam and asked what would happen if she took 1 away from the fi rst 80. CCSSM states that sixthgrade students should recognize that measures of center for a numerical data set summarize the set’s values with a single number (6.SP.3). She wanted to be sure that her students understood what the single number (mean) represented and were able to describe it precisely in their own words.  the Missing WoRds task",39,Connecting the Missing Words to the Common Core
40,Connecting the Missing Words to the Common Core,"After students completed the launch activity, Kulbacki handed out the Missing Words task. She told her students that they would be given fi fteen minutes to independently estimate the number of words missing from  the book page and to think about a the book page and to think about a reasonable explanation of how they derived their answers. She wanted students engaged in the Common Core’s Standards for Mathematical Practice (CCSSI 2010) throughout the activity. To ensure that they were making sense of the problem, she asked several to share with the class what the task was asking them to fi nd. Kulbacki also asked them whether they thought this activity could model a realistic problem.",40,Connecting the Missing Words to the Common Core
41,Connecting the Missing Words to the Common Core,"After the students worked inde- pendently, they shared their estimates and explanations in small groups. While walking around the room, she heard students constructing viable arguments about why they used various approaches. One student noted that he counted the number of lines that was the same as the length of his thumb. He then counted the number of words included in these lines. Finally, he counted how many thumb lengths the missing rectangle was and multiplied this by the number of words he had counted in his initial thumb measurement. ",41,Connecting the Missing Words to the Common Core
42,Connecting the Missing Words to the Common Core,"Two other students, Josh and D. J.,  counted the number of words in the visible lines and divided that total by the number of lines to fi nd the mean. Josh had included lines with one or two words whereas D. J. had left those out of his average. Josh said that those lines were necessary because it was possible that the same types of lines could be hidden under the rectangle. D. J. argued that this would skew the average and make it lower than it truly should be for each line. ",42,Connecting the Missing Words to the Common Core
43,Connecting the Missing Words to the Common Core,Grant and Bailey made convincing  arguments to support their strategy. ,43,Connecting the Missing Words to the Common Core

46,Connecting the Missing Words to the Common Core,"Of the lines that were completely visible, we characterized each line as tabbed [indented], full, or end [incomplete]. For each category, we found the average number of words per line. Then, by looking at the edge of the rectangle, we determined what category each covered line might be (tabbed, full, or end) and assigned this line the average number of words for that particular category. Finally, we added the average number of words for each line to get our total. [See fi g. 3.]",46,Connecting the Missing Words to the Common Core
47,Connecting the Missing Words to the Common Core,"Next, Kulbacki asked her students  to use whatever tools they felt were appropriate to calculate the mean and the range of the estimates provided by each member of their group. Several students pulled out their calculators; others used paper and pencil. They were very excited to share their responses with one another and hear the variety of explanations. By focusing on the group mean estimate and group range estimate, Kulbacki eliminated having a student feel embarrassed or inadequate if his or her number of words was, more or less, an outlier compared with the rest of the class. Kulbacki asked a member of each group to write the group’s mean range on the whiteboard at the front of the classroom. The mean values of the group estimates were  93, 132, 134, 150, 156, 162, 176, 184.",47,Connecting the Missing Words to the Common Core
48,Connecting the Missing Words to the Common Core,"The ranges of group members’ estimates were  12, 24, 26, 36, 36, 41, 67, 219.",48,Connecting the Missing Words to the Common Core
49,Connecting the Missing Words to the Common Core,"When all the groups’ values were posted, Kulbacki asked the class to look at the data and write a question they could ask about either set of results. One of her goals was to have her students make sense of the spread  (a) (b) and the shape of the data (6.SP.5c). Her students asked questions such as, “What is the range of our group estimates?” “What is the median value of all the mean estimates?” “Why are there so many different means?” and “How can you have a range of 219?” She was impressed with their questions and delighted to see so many of the students eager to respond and construct viable arguments to support their statements and facts. For example, Joel argued: “It is OK to have so many different means because we all used a different way of fi guring it out.” Matt replied, “Yes, some people included one-word lines, others didn’t. So it just depended on the strategy they used.” closing the actiVitY",49,Connecting the Missing Words to the Common Core
50,Connecting the Missing Words to the Common Core,"To complete the task, Kulbacki asked the class to fi nd the mean of all the estimates from the groups. Again, the  students selected appropriate tools to help them solve the problem. Once the groups satisfactorily calculated the class mean of 148, she posted this value on the whiteboard and asked, “Does the class mean represent the exact total number of words missing from the page? Why or why not?” The students were overheard constructing viable arguments to support their decisions, which was more important to Kulbacki than their answers. ",50,Connecting the Missing Words to the Common Core
51,Connecting the Missing Words to the Common Core,"Abigail responded, “I don’t think  you can ever fi gure out the exact number of words unless you lift up the rectangle or go look in the real book.” Brady agreed and said, “I think she is right. We really can’t tell how many words are hidden. So we are estimating the total.” Kulbacki knew the importance of having her students stop to think about the values they calculated and being sure they made ",51,Connecting the Missing Words to the Common Core

56,Connecting the Missing Words to the Common Core,"To enhance students’ learning in today’s classrooms, the role and selection of a task that promotes higherlevel thinking and connects to the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics are vital. As Kulbacki found, implementing a worthwhile task served several purposes. ",56,Connecting the Missing Words to the Common Core
57,Connecting the Missing Words to the Common Core,"First, it required students to apply  their knowledge of the concept of variability and distribution of a data set in a problem rooted in a familiar context. Rather than procedurally focusing on concepts such as mean, median, and mode, the task required a deeper understanding of the concept of measures of distribution and how to represent them. The task also provided opportunities for students to use various strategies and engage in higher-level thinking. In “doing mathematics” (Smith and Stein 1998), they were engaged in mathematical rigor as espoused in CCSSM.",57,Connecting the Missing Words to the Common Core
58,Connecting the Missing Words to the Common Core,"Second, the task provided a perfect  context for her sixth-grade students to engage in the Standards for Mathematical Practice.
