A family dog supplies the measurements for scatter plots and variables so that students can explore relationships among data sets—not to mention paws and tails. ,2,mtms2011-08-26a,,
"Arla Westenskow and Patricia S. Moyer-Packenham nNo person, place, or thing can capture  the attention of a class of sixth graders like “man’s best friend.” To prompt students’ interest in a series of lessons on proportional relationships, we brought in a unique teaching aid— a dog. Students used dog data and scatter plot applets to explore various relationships in a lesson called Canine Conjectures. A visit by a live dog provided the motivation while electronic technologies allowed data to be effi ciently processed, freeing students to focus on reasoning, observing patterns, decision making, and problem solving.  daY 1: canine caRgo",3,mtms2011-08-26a,,

The lessons used the scatter plot applet found at the National Library of Virtual Manipulatives site (see http:// nlvm.usu.edu). When students entered two sets of data, the computer developed an approximate line of fi t (a regression line) for the data, calculated the mean and the r-value (the correlation coeffi cient), and gave an equation describing the approximate line of fi t.",4,mtms2011-08-26a,,
"During the fi rst day of the lesson, students were introduced to a scatter plot, and they learned to use two variables that produced a linear relationship. During the second day, students explored the concept of two variables that were not directly proportional and that resulted in data points scattered around a line of best fi t. In the fi nal lesson, students  canine conjectures:",5,mtms2011-08-26a,,

We began the lesson by reading Counting on Frank (Clement 1991). The boy in the story makes many calculations based on relationships, including how many replicas of his dog, Frank, would fit in his bedroom.",6,mtms2011-08-26a,,
"As we read the book, the students made their own estimates. (Although the book’s creative illustrations piqued students’ interest, this lesson can be completed without the book.) After reading the story, we looked again at the page showing how many dogs the boy could fit into his bedroom, and asked, “How could the boy determine how many dog kennels would fit in his room?” We gave students the following measurement information about the kennel and the boy’s room:  The bottom of each dog kennel is 1 ft. × 2 ft. Each kennel stands 3 ft. tall. The room is 12 ft. × 18 ft. × 9 ft.",7,mtms2011-08-26a,,
"The evenly divisible dimensions allowed students to use a simple division method to divide the volume of the room by the volume of the dog kennel (i.e., 1944 cubic feet ÷ 6 cubic feet = 324 dog kennels). ",8,mtms2011-08-26a,,

Because the kennels would not necessarily pack perfectly into the cargo holds, dividing the volume of the cargo hold by the volume of the dog kennel would probably produce an overestimation. Although the quotient would include combinations of partial kennels that might fit near the edges of the cargo hold, real-world kennels would not. Therefore, when a student selected a vehicle that did not allow for perfect packing and used the simple-division method to calculate the number of kennels that would fit into the cargo hold, this number was actually an estimate. ",24,mtms2011-08-26a,,
"Some of the students’ presentations revealed that they were actively thinking about the packing issue when they drew pictures of the physical arrangement of the kennels. Other students made conjectures about the best arrangement to maximize the space and orientation of the kennels, keeping in mind that more kennels might fit into the vehicle if they were oriented vertically. However, this orientation was not desirable because a dog would not be comfortable inside an up-ended kennel. ",25,mtms2011-08-26a,,
"After sharing their solutions,  students were ready to enter the data on a scatter plot. We found that the graph was more visually friendly if we instructed students to set the range for the x-value and y-value (the lowerleft section of the applet) to 10 points above their highest data value. Students entered the cargo-hold volume in the left column (x) and the number of dog kennels in the right column (y) (see fig. 2).",26,mtms2011-08-26a,,
"When students entered the two  sets of data, the computer developed an approximate line of fit (a regression line), the mean, the r-value (the correlation coefficient), and an equation describing the approximate line of fit. The approximate line of fit is a visual tool used to make a general estimate of the strength and direction of the relationships between data groups. When students entered data into the scatter plot, they observed changes in the approximate line of fit, the clustering of data points, and the r-value. This helped students discover relationships and patterns in the data and to understand the effects of additional data points and outliers on the regression line and the correlation coefficient. ",27,mtms2011-08-26a,,
"It was important to establish the  concept of a direct linear relationship because past experience had taught us that some sixth-grade students have difficulty understanding this concept. We asked students to move the cursor along the approximate line of fit. They were surprised to discover that every pair of coordinates, reflecting the simple division method, had the same 6:1 ratio. Although students understood that the approximate line of fit connected their data, they had not understood that all points on the line would be values in the same proportion.",28,mtms2011-08-26a,,
"To further establish this concept,  a dog’s height is an example of continuous data; friendliness is a discrete-data factor. ",29,mtms2011-08-26a,,
Fig. 2 The number of dog kennels (y) that will fit into different-sized cargo holds (x) produced a direct linear relationship.,30,mtms2011-08-26a,,
"we asked them to use the approximate line of fit to predict the number of dog kennels that could be placed in randomly picked sizes of cargo holds. Although our class used the simple division method of comparing the values of x with their corresponding values of y to determine the 6:1 ratio, this ratio can also be determined by comparing the means  x y found in the lower-right corner of the scatter plot display (e.g., x y = 310; the ratio is approximately 6:1).",31,mtms2011-08-26a,,

"The second day’s lesson focused on the use of scatter plots to determine the relationships among groups of data that were not directly proportional and, therefore, scattered around the approximate line of fit. First, we considered the relationship between life expectancy and the size of the  dog. Then students considered the relationship between intelligence and the size of the dog. We ended the lesson with an open-ended exploration that used pairs of variables that the students selected.",33,mtms2011-08-26a,,
"Principles and Standards for School Mathematics (NCTM 2000) suggests that students find data from multiple resources, including websites, when exploring data analysis. To prepare for this lesson, each group of students  selected a specific breed of dog and found numerical information using  the site http://www.dogluvers.com. This website contains one-page summaries displaying numerical data on a variety of dogs. We suggested that each group find information on at least ten different breeds. Because we wanted students to have a full range of data, we asked each group to include information on the Chihuahua (6 in. tall, 2 lbs.) and the Irish wolfhound (35 in. tall, 120 lbs.). ",34,mtms2011-08-26a,,
"First, we chose two characteris- tics—height and life expectancy—that would demonstrate a negative relationship (see fig. 3a), meaning that as the x-value increases, the y-value decreases. For each selected breed, we entered into the scatter plot the measurements for height as the x-value and life expectancy as the y-value. As students entered each set of values, they began to observe that the data points clustered around a line of approximate fit. The class discussed the location of the various data points for each dog’s height and life expectancy and concluded that, in many instances, the larger the dog, the shorter the life span. Students also observed that the approximate line of fit made dramatic shifts when they were entering the first few data values. Then the line of fit appeared to become more stable as students entered the last few values into the scatter plot. ",35,mtms2011-08-26a,,
"The second relationship we investigated was dog size and intelligence. The class ranked dog breeds in order of intelligence, based on information found at http://petrix.com/dogint/ intelligence.html. The intelligence rankings on this scale ranged from 1 to 79, with 1 being the most intelligent and 79 the least intelligent. When students entered the data points comparing height and intelligence, they found that the points were randomly scattered across the graph, indicating either a weak, or no, relationship (see fig. 3b).",36,mtms2011-08-26a,,

"It is important to note that traits  such as intelligence, friendliness, and watchdog ability are rated using various discrete numbering systems; in comparison, the height of a dog or the length of its tail is a measure of continuous data. The differences between these two types of numbering systems and the assumptions of continuity can be easily misunderstood. To avert potential misunderstandings, teachers might discuss the proportional rela-",41,mtms2011-08-26a,,

"tionship between continuous measures (or measureable variables), such as length, by showing that the difference between one inch and two inches is one inch or that the difference between five inches and six inches is one inch. The increments between continuous variables remain constant. Similarly, teachers could demonstrate that five inches is five times one inch or that six inches is three times two inches. This shows students that continuous data are in a constant and proportional relationship.",44,mtms2011-08-26a,,
"In comparison, students must  understand the workings of a system using rank-ordered variables. For example, a dog ranked number 3 in intelligence is not 1/3 as intelligent as a dog ranked number 1. This example shows students that discrete data are not in a proportional relationship.",45,mtms2011-08-26a,,
"Groups of students then chose and  researched two characteristics across breeds and plotted the relationships on scatter plots. One group compared date of origin with friendliness; another chose size and aptitude for training. The whole class then recorded the findings from multiple groups (see fig. 4). Although we asked students to compare only ten dog breeds, most groups were so engaged in the relationships shown on the graphs that they used more than ten breeds. One student was so excited about his findings that he stayed in the classroom after the others went to recess, so that he could explain his thought processes. He reported to the teacher that he had predicted friendliness would have a negative relationship with watchdog ability. Instead, he found no relationship and that several of the best watchdogs had high rankings for friendliness.  daY 3: canine conJectURes",46,mtms2011-08-26a,,
"In the final lesson, we brought two dogs into the classroom so that students could measure the dogs’ physical  features and collect data. The goal of this lesson was to make conjectures about which physical features of dogs are proportional across breeds and to confirm these continuous relationships using the scatter plot.",47,mtms2011-08-26a,,
"The students had been anxiously  anticipating the opportunity to collect measurements from actual dogs. For the lesson, we used our own dogs, which were a contrast in size: The Leonberger was 120 pounds, and the Australian terrier was 17 pounds. After introducing our dogs to the class, we asked students to make conjectures about whether or not physical features of the two dogs would be proportional to their differences in weight. For example, the weights of the two dogs are in an approximately 1:7 proportional relationship; therefore, would the lengths of the tails and ears, heights, and running speeds also follow this 1:7 proportional relationship? ",48,mtms2011-08-26a,,
"Each student wrote his or her conjecture. Some conjectured that the big dog would run faster than the small dog but probably not seven times as fast. Others reported that they thought it was impossible for all measurements to be in a 1:7 proportion, because features like the dog’s ears or tongue could not be that long.",49,mtms2011-08-26a,,
"After students shared their conjectures, we collected the empirical data. For our first comparison, we timed each dog as it ran the length of the hall and found that the smaller dog ran faster than the larger dog. Then students recorded the average amount of dog food eaten daily by each dog (a 1:6 relationship). Next, students used a tape measure to take various height, girth, and length measurements for the two dogs. Students found relationships between the two dogs’ tails (1:4) and between the two dogs’ paws (1:2) by simplifying the ratios of the measurements they found. Students entered information into their scatter plots for each pair of physical features of the  two dogs. By simplifying the ratios of their measurements, the students found that seven of the thirteen physical features were in an approximate 1:2 or 1:3 relationship (see fig. 5). ",50,mtms2011-08-26a,,
"Students concluded that their  conjecture about the larger dog being faster was inaccurate. However, their conjecture was accurate that physical features (like the tongues and ears) would be in proportional relationships less than 1:7. Several students took the lesson one step further by measuring their own family dogs at home.",51,mtms2011-08-26a,,

"One possible extension activity is to explore the notion of extrapolation. For example, when comparing dog heights with life expectancy, the linear model works within the x-value and y-value plotted. However, the linear model is not useful beyond the points plotted. To help students consider this notion, teachers might ask these questions: •	 Would	a	very	tall	dog	have	a	negative life expectancy?  •	 Would	a	dog	have	a	very	high	life	 expectancy if the linear model predicts that its height is only one inch?  •	 Although	the	line	on	the	scatter	 plot supports these claims, why are they unrealistic? ",53,mtms2011-08-26a,,
"Students might consider situations in which extrapolation is acceptable, particularly when the predicted data are close to other points in the scatter plot. They should become aware that extrapolation can produce nonsensical conclusions when the predictions are well outside the domain of the scatter plot. ",54,mtms2011-08-26a,,

Although students filled every extra spare moment of these lessons describing their personal experiences with dogs, in the process, we recognized that they had learned about scatter plots and proportional relationships.
