4,Developing Communication and Metacognition through Question Generating,"KANSAS CONRADYmmMs. Smith’s class discussion in  fi gure 1 not only helped students better understand the problem they were solving but also set the ground work for an instructional activity she uses throughout the year called “question generating” (Keeley and Tobey 2011, p. 161). The questiongenerating strategy, when used effectively, helps students develop both communication skills and metacognitive behaviors. Communication is defi ned in NCTM’s Principles and Standards for School Mathematics as “a way of sharing ideas and clarifying understanding,” through which “ideas become objects of refl ection, refi nement, discussion, and amendment”  (2000, p. 60). When ideas themselves become objects of study, students engage in metacognitive behaviors: actions we take to monitor our own thinking. These include planning solutions, monitoring progress, and evaluating results (Brown 1987, emphasis added). Smith begins to develop her students’ communication skills and metacognitive behaviors by engaging them in discourse about their own thinking and learning.",4,Developing Communication and Metacognition through Question Generating
5,Developing Communication and Metacognition through Question Generating,"Facilitating discourse may be the  teaching practice that relies most heavily on communication and metacognitive behaviors. Effective discourse engages students in analyzing and comparing approaches and arguments. Students need strong communicative and metacognitive behaviors to participate in effective discourse so that students can initiate and carry on mathematical conversations themselves. They may contrast strategies, explain and defend their thinking to each other and their teacher, and help shape the thinking of their peers through feedback and constructive criticism (Hufferd-Ackles, Fuson, and Sherin 2004). That is, effective discourse is metacognitive communication. Not only will students’ abilities to engage ",5,Developing Communication and Metacognition through Question Generating

7,Developing Communication and Metacognition through Question Generating,"This year, Ms. Smith is focused on developing her sixth-grade students’ ability to think about and reflect on their own learning in her math class. She began the year by having students work both individually and in small groups on a variety of problems. As they did, they had many conversations about the ways in which the students best learned. Students decided that working in small groups helps them learn and that they learn best when working on “good” questions. For example, one day Smith asked her students whether the question they were working on was a “good” question.",7,Developing Communication and Metacognition through Question Generating
8,Developing Communication and Metacognition through Question Generating,Maxwell volunteered that he thought it was interesting because all the  groups solved it differently.  “Do you think that helped you learn?” Smith asked.,8,Developing Communication and Metacognition through Question Generating
9,Developing Communication and Metacognition through Question Generating,"“It helped me understand how the different ways to solve the problem  are related,” he replied.",9,Developing Communication and Metacognition through Question Generating
10,Developing Communication and Metacognition through Question Generating,"“Can you explain?” “Well, Emma’s group solved it by looking at groups of 3, but Aiden’s  group used pictures to show their solution.” “And how did that help you?” “I could see how Aiden’s group’s pictures related to the groups in ",10,Developing Communication and Metacognition through Question Generating

12,Developing Communication and Metacognition through Question Generating,Maxwell nodded.,12,Developing Communication and Metacognition through Question Generating
13,Developing Communication and Metacognition through Question Generating,"Smith asked the rest of the class whether they agreed with Maxwell’s observation, and many students expressed agreement, so the class decided to add “multiple solutions” to their list of characteristics of “good” questions.",13,Developing Communication and Metacognition through Question Generating

16,Developing Communication and Metacognition through Question Generating,"In figure 2, Emma was able to  communicate her understanding about when and how fractions might be used in real life. With his response, Aiden pointed out that construction may use the same operations. If students were not required to share their ideas about the use of fractions, they might have stopped at identifying a situation in which fractions were used. Because they needed to justify their thinking to a partner, they also needed to consider what operations might be used with fractions and how. In other words, communicating with a partner  engaged students in planning how they might work with fractions in each situation. Planning is an important   P,",16,Developing Communication and Metacognition through Question Generating

19,Developing Communication and Metacognition through Question Generating,"Ava and Jake’s exchange in  fi gure 3 illustrates another important metacognitive behavior: monitoring. Jake was able to recognize when and why he was becoming confused in his problem-solving progress and, in deciding to draw a picture, he was able to identify and use a different strategy that allowed him to progress. Ava monitored Jake’s problem solving as well and identifi ed his use of division. These monitoring behaviors were necessary because the students were responsible for communicating their own thinking and understanding the thinking of others.",19,Developing Communication and Metacognition through Question Generating
20,Developing Communication and Metacognition through Question Generating,Smith prompted student refl ec- tion and refi nement of their conceptual understanding of how arithmetic operations are used with rational numbers by asking them to evaluate ,20,Developing Communication and Metacognition through Question Generating

22,Developing Communication and Metacognition through Question Generating,"Smith asks her class, “When might you need to use arithmetic operations with fractions?” to get them to generate ideas. ",22,Developing Communication and Metacognition through Question Generating
23,Developing Communication and Metacognition through Question Generating,"Emma shoots her hand up quickly, waving it in the air. Smith responds:  “Let’s let everyone think of their own idea fi rst, and then we’ll hear your idea.”",23,Developing Communication and Metacognition through Question Generating
24,Developing Communication and Metacognition through Question Generating,"After a few moments of quiet contemplation, Smith asks students to put  their thumbs up if they were able to think of an example. Because a few students do not put their thumbs up, Smith asks the students to turn to their elbow partner and share their idea.",24,Developing Communication and Metacognition through Question Generating
25,Developing Communication and Metacognition through Question Generating,"Emma quickly turns to her partner and almost shouts “Sewing!” and then  continues, “You might have to add measurements that are fractions. Like 3 1/2 inches and 1 1/4 inches.”",25,Developing Communication and Metacognition through Question Generating
26,Developing Communication and Metacognition through Question Generating,"Her partner, Aiden, who had not raised his hand, furrows his brow for a moment before responding, “How about construction? Like building houses or cabinets? A lot more people do that.”",26,Developing Communication and Metacognition through Question Generating
27,Developing Communication and Metacognition through Question Generating,"As Emma and Aiden talk about their ideas, other groups around the room share ideas about using fractions in time (3 1/2 hours before a quarter after nine), polling (3 out of 5 strongly agree, and 1 out of 5 somewhat agree), and baking (double a recipe that uses 1 1/4 cups of sugar). ",27,Developing Communication and Metacognition through Question Generating
28,Developing Communication and Metacognition through Question Generating,Fig. 3 Smith’s students share their thinking.,28,Developing Communication and Metacognition through Question Generating
29,Developing Communication and Metacognition through Question Generating,"Smith calls on a few students to share ideas. As they do, she questions the students about what operations they could perform with fractions in each scenario they imagined. Emma and Aiden have diffi culty imagining when you might need to divide fractions in construction or sewing. However, another pair of students is able to articulate a reason to divide fractions using baking as an example.",29,Developing Communication and Metacognition through Question Generating
30,Developing Communication and Metacognition through Question Generating,"Madison says, “If, like, you needed 4 1/3 cups, but the biggest measuring  cup you had was like, three-quarters of a cup, you would need to see how many times three-quarters goes into 4 1/3.”",30,Developing Communication and Metacognition through Question Generating
31,Developing Communication and Metacognition through Question Generating,"Smith asks whether they were sure that would be using division to do  that. Madison and her partner Ava are certain, but Jake disagrees. He says, “I know that three-quarters is less than a full cup. So if I need 4 1/3 cup, I know I’ll need at least 4 three-quarter cups and have an extra quarter cup. . . .” Jake stops abruptly, confused, but Smith prompts him to continue sharing what he is thinking. He responds, “It’s a lot of numbers and it’s getting jumbled. Can I draw it instead?” Smith agrees, and Jake goes to the whiteboard, drawing a diagram like the one shown below:",31,Developing Communication and Metacognition through Question Generating
32,Developing Communication and Metacognition through Question Generating,"After Jake draws, he continues his explanation: “So, I know I can get 5 threequarters out of 4 1/3 cups, but I did it with pictures, not dividing.”",32,Developing Communication and Metacognition through Question Generating
33,Developing Communication and Metacognition through Question Generating,"Ava jumps into the conversation.  “But you did divide; you divided each  1 cup by three-quarters cup. You just did it with pictures, but you still found that you get 1/3 cup and one-quarter cup remaining.”",33,Developing Communication and Metacognition through Question Generating
34,Developing Communication and Metacognition through Question Generating,Fig. 4 Students engage in question generating.,34,Developing Communication and Metacognition through Question Generating
35,Developing Communication and Metacognition through Question Generating,"After the class determines that baking examples will allow them to create questions using all four arithmetic operations, Smith displays several measuring cups and large containers, which are each labeled with their capacity. The measuring cups hold 1/4, 1/3, and 1/2 cups each, and the containers hold 3 1/4, 2 2/3, and 4 1/2 cups each. Smith asks her students to generate good questions using these tools and measurements. Before they begin, she prompts her students to recall what they have decided a “good” question looks like. After reviewing the three criteria, Smith asks them to work in groups of two or three to create some questions. These are some of the questions created by the groups: •  Determine how many times each cup measurement goes into each   of the container measurements.",35,Developing Communication and Metacognition through Question Generating
36,Developing Communication and Metacognition through Question Generating,•  What is the smallest amount you can measure out using only these   measurements? •  How many different ways could you fill up the largest containers   using the other containers?,36,Developing Communication and Metacognition through Question Generating
37,Developing Communication and Metacognition through Question Generating,Smith directs each group to pair with another group to review the   questions they wrote. Then she asks them to determine which group wrote the question that best fits the definition of a “good” question and revise that question to make it even better. Some groups do not find one another’s questions interesting; others have difficulty thinking about alternate ways to solve the problem. But every group seems to be challenged by the questions in front of them.,37,Developing Communication and Metacognition through Question Generating
38,Developing Communication and Metacognition through Question Generating,"Ryan and Ethan begin to discuss whether it is a better question to ask students to fill up the large container using as few “pours” as possible or if finding all the different ways to fill up the large container is more challenging. Ryan says, “If you have to do it with the least pours, there’s only one way to do that. We need questions with multiple solutions.” Ethan replies that even though there is only one answer, there are lots of solution paths to the answer. He demonstrates an exchange method: “So I could start with just filling up the whole 4 1/4 cups with quarter- cup pours. It would take seventeen pours, but I know I can replace two quarter cups with a half cup, which will decrease the number of pours I need, and keep doing that until I can’t do any more replacements.”",38,Developing Communication and Metacognition through Question Generating
39,Developing Communication and Metacognition through Question Generating,"Ryan asks, “But are you sure that will get to the least amount of pours? I think for the least amount of pours, we have to use the 2 1/3-cup container, but I don’t know how you do that if you don’t start with 1/3 cup measures.”",39,Developing Communication and Metacognition through Question Generating
40,Developing Communication and Metacognition through Question Generating,"Smith suggests that the two boys first try to determine the solution with the least amount of pours and then return to decide whether there is more than one way to find that solution. As groups continue to work, they revise their questions to make them more challenging, more interesting, or to allow for more solution methods. By the end of the period, all groups are satisfied that they have at least one “good” question.",40,Developing Communication and Metacognition through Question Generating
41,Developing Communication and Metacognition through Question Generating,"each other’s work (see fig. 4). As students examined and attempted each other’s questions, they began to consider the strengths and weaknesses  not only of the questions but also of the various solution methods. By doing so, they were evaluating the work of their peers in creating the ques- tion, another important metacognitive behavior, and also monitoring and evaluating their own thinking as they created solutions.",41,Developing Communication and Metacognition through Question Generating
42,Developing Communication and Metacognition through Question Generating,"The presentation of questions  after revision allowed a large-group discussion to unfold about the generated questions and their solutions (see fig. 5). In addition, this communication activity gave Smith valuable insight into her students’ thinking about mathematics as she moved about the room to help facilitate group discussions while the students attempted to solve each question. Similarly, the student presenters also gained further insight into the problem-solving strategies of their peers since they were also facilitating group discussions.",42,Developing Communication and Metacognition through Question Generating

44,Developing Communication and Metacognition through Question Generating,"The question-generating strategy is effective because it asks students to communicate about their own thinking, which requires them to engage in a variety of metacognitive behaviors, including planning solutions, monitoring progress, and evaluating their results. Communication is the only way in which the thinking of students can be made public and understood by students and teachers alike. Student-created products, like the questions and solutions generated by this activity, can then turn into objects of “reflection, refinement, discussion and amendment,” important metacognitive behaviors and the key components of communicative activity (NCTM 2000, p. 60).  This engages students in acts of metacognition as well as further  communication in the classroom.",44,Developing Communication and Metacognition through Question Generating

51,Developing Communication and Metacognition through Question Generating,"In the next class period, each group takes a turn presenting their question to the rest of the groups and facilitating discussions as the other groups attempt to solve their question. Smith reminds her students that good questions are meant to be challenging and warns the presenting group against giving too much help to others as they try to solve the question. She then joins the presenting students in facilitating discussion in each group. Once students have solved each problem, Smith prompts the class to discuss whether the question met the criteria of a “good” question.",51,Developing Communication and Metacognition through Question Generating
52,Developing Communication and Metacognition through Question Generating,The favorite question generated was this: “How many different ways could you fill up the largest container using the other items provided?” One of the reasons this was a class favorite was that several groups had different approaches to solving it.,52,Developing Communication and Metacognition through Question Generating
