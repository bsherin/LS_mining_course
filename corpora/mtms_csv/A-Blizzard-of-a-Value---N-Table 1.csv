0,A Blizzard of a Value - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Who has been to Dairy Queen and purchased a Blizzard? Ms. Bosetti asked her students. During the summer, Bosetti had seen many of her former and future students at the local Dairy Queen enjoying Blizzard desserts and wondered, Which Blizzard size is the best value? She used this context for a ratios and proportions task to give students experience  modeling with mathematics.",,
1,A Blizzard of a Value - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Modeling with mathematics requires engagement in problem solving that is focused on realistic situations (CDE 2013; Kanold and Larson 2012). The model with mathematics text within the Common Cores Standards for Mathematical Practice (SMP) states: Mathematically proficient students can apply the mathematics they know to solve problems arising in everyday life, society, and the workplace (CCSSI 2010, p. 7). Tasks and instruction that encourage students to analyze mathematical relationships, draw conclusions, and reflect and improve on end products (i.e., models) address SMP 4  (Fennell, Kobett, and Wray 2013). This characterization of modeling with mathematics brings up two key instructional questions: What should students engaged in modeling with mathematics be doing? What should teachers do to promote modeling with mathematics?",,
2,A Blizzard of a Value - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,COMMON CORE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT,,
3,A Blizzard of a Value - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Bosetti, a seventh-grade teacher in a rural Ohio school district, participated with 15 other middle school math teachers in a yearlong professional development (PD) program. While completing 100 face-to-face hours, the teachers focused on three goals:",,
4,A Blizzard of a Value - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The PD leaders recognized that Bosetti and her peers needed to experience problems that promoted mathematical modeling before they could design such a task for their own students. So that these teachers might have a way to reflect on what it means to model with mathematics, the teachers completed a task called the Airplane problem (modified from Case Studies for Kids 2013). In this task, teachers were given data from a paper airplane contest that showed the results of various attempts by several pilots to fly four different paper airplanes. Measurements with the planes flight distance, distance from target, and time in flight were given for each attempt. The problems objective was to use the data to give the judges of the contest the best way to determine which paper airplane was the best floater and which was the most  accurate.",,
5,A Blizzard of a Value - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Bosetti and her peers worked on the problem for about two hours,  frequently drawing on prior mathematics knowledge from various grade levels. Simultaneously, they figured out which quantities in the problem (e.g., time and distance) were important and any relationships between them. Each group wrote a report, delivered a presentation to their peers about their approach, and justified why their model for determining the winner was the best. Finally, each group reflected on possible model refinements. These problem-solving assumptions and actions are part of the mathematical modeling process (Fennell, Kobett, and Wray 2013).",,
6,A Blizzard of a Value - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"After completing the activity, Bosetti and the others realized that modeling with mathematics meant engaging students with real problems or realistic scenarios, talking with and about mathematical representations, and re-examining their mathematical models after receiving feedback from peers. Following the PD that included similar modeling tasks, Bosetti and others designed and implemented tasks that fostered reasoning and sense making related to CCSSM.",,
7,A Blizzard of a Value - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,CREATING THE DAIRY QUEEN DILEMMA,,
8,A Blizzard of a Value - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Bosetti followed the PDs approach (see Bostic 2012/2013) to construct the Dairy Queen Dilemma, a worthwhile task meant to engage her students in modeling with mathematics. (Names of all students in this article are pseudonyms.) Such a worthwhile task supports learning mathematics content, promotes engagement in mathematical practices, and fosters mathematical communication among students (NCTM 2007). This approach involved a four-step process: examining and reflecting on the mathematics standards (Content and Practices) of interest; considering possible mathematics curricular tasks that could be improved to become more like problems rather than exercises; reflecting on students cultural contexts or motivating realistic events to frame the task; and then revising the task to produce a clearly worded worthwhile task. This task also addresses multiple Common Core Content Standards within the Ratio and Proportional Relationships domain, including Recognize and represent proportional relationships between quantities (CCSSI 2010, p. 48).",,
9,A Blizzard of a Value - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Classroom Culture,,
10,A Blizzard of a Value - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"A key component for success with modeling-focused tasks is enacting appropriate norms for doing mathematics, talking about mathematics, and working collaboratively on mathematics projects. Early in the school year, Bosetti and her students established such productive classroom norms as these: We will always look for another way to solve a problem. We will always justify our work, and We will critique the idea rather than the person. Having established these norms, Bosetti felt confident that her students were prepared for the Dairy Queen Dilemma.",,
11,A Blizzard of a Value - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,The Dairy Queen Dilemma,,
12,A Blizzard of a Value - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Bosetti told her students she was recently at Dairy Queen and wondered which Blizzard size was the best value, assuming that calorie content was unimportant. Several students suggested that the large Blizzard was likely the best value, possibly drawing on prior knowledge that larger sizes tended to be better values. Bosetti then distributed copies of the problem (see fig. 1), and students self-selected groups of three or four. She then gave each group a set of four cups, one cup of each size, as well as one measuring tape. Most groups started problem solving by measuring the cups diameters and heights. Discussions focused on how to measure the cups (i.e., inside or outside). Matthew, like most students, measured the diameter of the base and noticed that the bases of the mini cup and large cup were smaller than those of the small and medium cups. Something isnt right here! he said, making a puzzled expression. Many students, like Matthew, remeasured their cups to confirm this unusual finding. Matthew then shared his finding with Bosetti. When she asked why, Matthew replied, I dont know, then continued problem solving with his group.",,
13,A Blizzard of a Value - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
14,A Blizzard of a Value - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Multiple groups made a second observation: The bottom and top bases of the cups were not the same measurement. Bosetti stopped the class and asked, What should we do? Emma suggested that they assume that each cups base was identical because the difference was less than half a centimeter. Bosetti asked the class, Do you agree? Do we want to assume that? Students nodded in agreement and went back to work.",,
15,A Blizzard of a Value - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"A short time later, one group asked Bosetti, How full is the Blizzard cup? Again, she stopped the class and asked students how to proceed. Matthew and others thought that they might assume that the ice cream was level with the top of the cup. This assumption made modeling easier, but Megan reminded everyone that the local Dairy Queen usually made Blizzards that spilled over the top; hence, their mathematical models might not be completely accurate. This assumption offered some degree of precision and accuracy that seemed reasonable for the problem.",,
16,A Blizzard of a Value - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"After circulating around the room, Bosetti noticed that students were ready to share their problem solving with peers. She purposefully selected students from three groups to present strategies that involved graphs, tables, and symbol manipulation. They shared their ideas by (1) displaying their written work for the class, (2) explaining what they did and why, and (3) justifying their approach and solution. Three groups work and ensuing class discussions are shared.",,
17,A Blizzard of a Value - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,A Graphical Approach,,
18,A Blizzard of a Value - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"One group of students used a graph to model the mathematical elements embedded in the situation. Toni, placing her graph (see fig. 2) under the document camera, said that her group tried to create one coordinate point for each cup size so that they might create a straight line with the origin.",,
19,A Blizzard of a Value - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
20,A Blizzard of a Value - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Her group put price in dollars on the x-axis and volume in cm3 on the y-axis. This approach created four line segments, one for each cup size. Toni added that the steepest line indicated the best value, yet she had difficulty explaining why this approach worked, saying, It just seemed like the right way. Tonis peers commented that her justification needed some work but that the model seemed reasonable. Toni closed by adding that the  medium was the steepest slope; however, she agreed that more information might clarify her groups position. For instance, it might help if she labeled the endpoints of each segment. Bosetti asked if her group wanted more time to think and reflect on their model; the group agreed to explain their thinking later.",,
21,A Blizzard of a Value - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,A Pictorial Approach,,
22,A Blizzard of a Value - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Sean placed his groups work, which involved a pictorial approach combined with some calculations, under the document camera (see fig. 3). Each circle represents a different cup size. We measured the diameter, then calculated the circumference, and  finally found the volume for each cup.",,
23,A Blizzard of a Value - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
24,A Blizzard of a Value - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"He then shared that his group compared price and volume of the cups during their small-group  problem solving before making the whole-class presentation. This comparison was not evident in their written work. The ratio for the large and medium were close. They determined that the large was 97.2 cm3 per dollar, whereas the medium was 96.1 cm3 per dollar. On the basis of these findings,  they felt that the large size was the best value because you get more Blizzard per dollar in the large. As soon as Sean ended his presentation, several hands were raised. Emily asked Sean, I got different ratios. How did you measure your cups? Sean showed the class by holding the ruler to the base of the cup to measure the diameter and then the edge of the cup to determine the height. Emily replied, Thats how I did it, but I got different volume measurements. Bosetti asked Emily if she would like to share her work next so they might compare it.",,
25,A Blizzard of a Value - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,A Tabular Approach,,
26,A Blizzard of a Value - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Emilys group created a table (see  fig. 4) to organize information about the cups. Emily and her peers discussed the information they gathered (i.e., cup height, diameter, area of cup base, volume of cup, and cup price) and why that information was necessary to answer the problem. Her group concluded that the largest unit rate, the medium Blizzard (96.1 cm3 per dollar), was the best value. Emily added that the large Blizzard (94.3 cm3 per dollar) was just slightly less than the medium. Sean commented that his height measurement for the large size was different, which resulted in different volume and ratio values.",,
27,A Blizzard of a Value - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
28,A Blizzard of a Value - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Emily and Sean exchanged ideas and tried to show each other in front of the entire class that one individuals measurements were correct while the other was incorrect. Breanna interrupted the exchange and addressed Bosetti, They might have measured differently, so their numbers might be slightly different. Bosetti pressed Breanna about what she meant by measured differently. Breanna described that it was difficult to be precise with the measuring tools they had, which might lead to rounding errors. Bosetti asked, Is it possible that if we had better tools then we might be able to better answer this question? You know, is it 15.5 or 16 cm? Everyone nodded in agreement. Given what we have, is it possible to have different answers about the best value? The class answered yes, that the exact height of the large cup was between 15.5 cm and 16 cm. Rounding your answer down to 15.5 or up to 16 cm impacts your final answer, doesnt it? asked Bosetti. Students nodded in agreement because both groups answers were correct,  based on their problem-solving approach. Given their tools, it was reasonable to conclude that either the medium or large was the best value; however, the work had to justify the conclusion. Sean and Emily concluded that better measuring tools might help determine the best value by alleviating the rounding error.",,
29,A Blizzard of a Value - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Emily then explained, The medium is the best value. But if you wanted more Blizzard, then the large wasnt a bad deal. This comment raised an interesting point that Bosetti expanded on: If I want a large Blizzard, is it much worse in value than the medium? Not really, Matthew said, if you want the large Blizzard, then get it. Its close in volume per dollar to the medium Blizzards ratio. Clearly, students were wrestling with the real-life implication of this task: If an individual wants more, then he or she might be willing to pay more. The next day, Bosetti opened her class by asking Tonis group to share their ideas. Toni placed her work (see fig. 2) under the document camera and said,",,
30,A Blizzard of a Value - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We measured the cups like Seans group. Then, we found the ratio of a cups volume to dollars and simplified it to find the unit rate. Then, we compared those numbers. The biggest number [the unit rate expressed as volume per dollar] was the best value. We think the medium is the best value, just slightly better than the large. You can see this in our graph because the red line (medium) is on top of the blue line (large), which means the medium is the best value. We understand how Emilys group thought the large was a better value.",,
31,A Blizzard of a Value - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE DAIRY QUEEN DILEMMA,,
32,A Blizzard of a Value - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Following the Dairy Queen Dilemma, Bosetti abstracted some key ideas for students from the experience. First, she reminded students that numerous effective ways are possible to determine whether one ratio is greater than another. Although symbolic approaches may be efficient, Toni believed that the graphical approach easily showed her which ratio was greater. Bosetti hinted that Tonis idea of comparing unit rates (slope) would come up again later in mathematics.",,
33,A Blizzard of a Value - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Second, students added that they learned how to compare ratios while solving a realistic problem. They felt motivated to determine the best value and did so in a logical manner: by comparing unit rates. Bosetti did not lecture during her lesson at any time. The problem itself provided an engaging context to foster perseverance while problem solving. Students were able to recognize and later represent the proportional relationships to  determine the best Blizzard value.",,
34,A Blizzard of a Value - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"An important feature of Bosettis instruction was that it engaged students in modeling with mathematics using multiple representations (i.e.,  tables, graphs, and diagrams). Students were able to frame their thinking using appropriate representations and effectively compare the unit rates for each cup size. The lesson also gave students like Toni a chance to re-evaluate their thinking and have a second chance to describe their problem solving.",,
35,A Blizzard of a Value - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Finally, students learned a valuable lesson about using appropriate tools and about limitations of precision. Many students wished for more accurate tools that measured tenths of a centimeter rather than half centimeters. They wanted to have the answer rather than an answer, which was more typical of other problems they solved. Bosetti used this opportunity to share important conclusions from the activity: Sometimes there are two answers to the same problem, and both might be correct. Or, if two or more individuals problem-solving approaches are justified adequately and limitations of those approaches are recognized, then multiple solutions are possible.",,
36,A Blizzard of a Value - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,HOW A BLIZZARD CAN HELP MODEL MATH,,
37,A Blizzard of a Value - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The Dairy Queen Dilemma engaged students in making sense of problems and persevering in solving them, modeling with mathematics, using appropriate tools strategically, and attending to precision (CCSSI 2010). Students felt that this modeling task was a fun way to use mathematics to make sense of real-life phenomena. One student wondered aloud whether the medium size might be the best value compared with other cup sizes, like those found at fast food restaurants or convenience stores. I never thought that the medium was the best value [at Dairy Queen]. I assume its always the biggest one, said Breanna. Bosetti asked Breanna and others to explore this question on their own. Bosetti said that the encouragement to create and implement the Dairy Queen task in her classroom as well as the feedback from her PD instructors and peers gave her confidence to write and enact other tasks that drew on students interests and the local community:",,
38,A Blizzard of a Value - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Teaching was already fun for me, but now its even more fun. Students are excited and engaged in learning math. I dont worry about [explicitly] teaching math when I do modeling problems like the Dairy Queen Dilemma because students are doing mathematics.",,
