"Name ______________________________ 3. Stores often hold a “buy one, get one,” or BOGO, sale. The terms vary; some may offer the second item free, and others may offer the second item at half price. In the case of buy one, get one free, a person buying two $10 books would pay $10 instead of the regular price of $20—a 50% discount. If the second item was half price, the person would pay $10 + $5 = $15, which is a 25% discount on the list price of $20 for the two books.    a.

"My sixth-grade and seventh-grade algebra 1 students completed this activity soon after their Presidents’ Day holiday when many had been out shopping. It provided an opportunity to discuss consumer issues while brushing up on their percent skills. We started the lesson by discussing a food product package that stated: “Now 20% More Shrimp.” The students quickly realized that the package could now contain six shrimp, one more than the original five, and still boast a misleading 20 percent increase. With an admonition of caveat emptor, they dove into the activity. Some students initially thought  that the exclamation point in the cartoon was to be used as a factorial symbol when evaluating the expression. We discussed when to use the  calculator’s pi key versus the approximation 3.14. Beyond that, they were able to complete most of the exercises independently using a calculator.
