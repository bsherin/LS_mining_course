"Home Area and History wWhile reading the Washington Post one morning, I saw an article about the average size of American houses throughout history (Higgins 2007). According to the article, houses are currently about three to four times larger than they were in 1790. Not only that, the average size of a family during colonial times was much larger than today. Early American families averaged 7 people, whereas modern families average 2.6 people. These facts made me think of our current study of American history in social studies and our approaching unit on area in mathematics. I wanted to find a way to incorporate this housing information into a lesson for my students.",2,mtms2008-02-349a,,
"I teach sixth grade in a Title 1  school in the Fairfax County Public School system in northern Virginia. The total school population is around 350 students. Two-thirds of my class of 24 students is male. Fifty percent of  my students are ESOL, including four ESOL1 students. Eight first languages, other than English, are spoken, including Vietnamese, Urdu, Spanish, Ga, Chinese, Korean, Turkish, and Persian. Many of these second-language students perform below grade level in mathematics, so all the lessons need to be structured with a combination of visual and descriptive elements to help build knowledge for these limited-English speakers.  christopher scaptura, Christopher.",3,mtms2008-02-349a,,

"Students knew the formulas for the  area of a variety of simple geometric shapes, but they had difficulty relating the concept of area to actual applications. They needed to see that “measuring area is actually covering the interior of a two-dimensional region with smaller, square units” (Ferrer et al. 2001). One particular problem faced by my students seemed to be an incomplete understanding of the conservation of area—that is, a region can be cut and rearranged without changing the area.",6,mtms2008-02-349a,,

"To address this concern and overlay some meaningful social studies content, I developed a lesson based on the changing size of homes. We began our lesson by discussing pictures of houses from the eighteenth century and those in use today, then compared the size of the average homes by expressing the area as a square with sides of specific dimensions. The 700-square-foot early-American home, a square with sides of about 26.5 feet, would be an easy comparison, since our classroom is about 750 square feet. The modern home was a bit more difficult to compare, since a square representing 2400 square feet would measure about 49 feet per side. The linear measure was easy to visualize by looking out into the hallway and having a student count off 50 linoleum blocks on the floor. Again, our comparison to the area of our classroom could be made by noting that the average house today would be about three times the size of our room.",8,mtms2008-02-349a,,
The more significant comparison  came when we considered the number of people living in each home. Dividing the area of the eighteenth-century home by the number of people who lived in it yields an average area per person of about 100 square feet. We used a tape measure to mark off a  10 ft. × 10 ft. area in our classroom. ,9,mtms2008-02-349a,,
"Students started to realize that 100 square feet is not really a large area. We then divided the area of a modern house by the average number of people per family (2.6) and determined that today the average person has about 923 square feet of living space, an area slightly bigger than our classroom. This area is a little more than nine times as much space as a person had in 1790. We discussed the idea of conservation of area and how most houses are not built as large squares 49 feet per side but are composed of smaller geometric shapes whose areas are added to achieve the total area of the home. To link this idea to the homework, I asked the students to think about their own rooms. Are they square or rectangular or some other shape? Are they a combination of geometric shapes? Students then discussed with their table group what shapes made up their rooms. Most related that their rooms were not just one large rectangular shape but a combination of smaller rectangular areas. Some had angled walls, which created triangular shapes.  hoW MUch sPace do YoU need to liVe?",10,mtms2008-02-349a,,
"Next I distributed the activity sheet and two sheets of 1/4 inch graph paper. The first step of this homework assignment was to draw the two comparative areas to scale on the first sheet of graph paper, with each 1/4inch square representing 1 square foot. After creating the graphic comparison, I asked the students to write why they thought the average house size has continued to increase, whereas the size of the family has decreased.",11,mtms2008-02-349a,,
"The last steps involved having  each student measure and draw his or her own room to an appropriate scale using the second sheet of graph paper, accurately showing the scale, the area of the room, and the mathematical process they used to determine the area. For those who share a room with  one or more siblings, students were to determine the area of the room and divide by the number of siblings to get their personal “living area.”",12,mtms2008-02-349a,,
"Students were given a rubric so that they would know exactly how their work would be graded. In most cases, they were able to complete all the tasks. Many showed a misunderstanding of the requirement to compare the area per person of the eighteenth-century home with the area per person of a modern house. Some students had problems relating the measured dimensions of their rooms and major objects in the room to an appropriate scale in the drawing. They were able to calculate the area of the room mathematically but had difficulty explaining their reasoning. To address this difficulty, we spent another day focusing on creating and measuring irregularly shaped areas in our classroom. ",13,mtms2008-02-349a,,
"Student work and mathematical explanations demonstrated that my students gained a better, if still incomplete, appreciation for the idea of conservation of area through the context of our social studies lesson focused on the increasing average size of a home. As a secondary benefit, the students were made aware of representing a given area to scale, as well as gaining a realization that life for the average American in the eighteenth century would have been profoundly different from what most of us experience today.
