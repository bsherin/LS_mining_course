"Integers Made Easy:  Just Walk It Off wWalk It Off is a multisensory method  that I developed to teach students how to multiply and divide as well as add and subtract integers. In my experience, this method makes these processes much more effective, efficient, and entertaining than other approaches. Students have the opportunity to use the Process Standards while exploring a topic that is often taught strictly as algorithms without understanding. In addition to having visual, oral, and aural characteristics, Walk It Off is kinesthetic, because students literally walk off problems on number lines. The multiple learning modalities that this method uses are compatible with brain-based learning. Students become actively involved in doing calculations as they physically act out problems using the underlying concepts of integers. Although many books and lessons already use number lines to demonstrate addition and subtraction in various ways, the Walk It Off method makes it possible to use a number line for multiplication and division of integers as well. Using integers becomes easy, because  students learn only two slightly different processes for the two basic groups of operations: one process for addition and subtraction and a similar process for multiplication and division.  how to chalk it Up  and walk it off",2,mtms2007-09-118a,,
"Opposites and absolute value are the underlying concepts of integers and are the keys to operating on them. Walk It Off explores how to add, subtract, multiply, and divide integers by teaching students that the sign of a number indicates whether to change the direction of movement on a number line, whereas the absolute value tells them how far to travel. Opposite signs, negative signs, or subtraction signs mean to turn the opposite direction. ",3,mtms2007-09-118a,,
"On the first day, I go over parts 1 and 2 of the student note pages with the class. (See fig. 1.) In part 1, to “when you see the symbol ‘–,’ ” students say things like minus, subtract, negative, hyphen, and so forth. The discussion continues until the students state the key idea of “opposite of.” I then draw a large number line on the board, write ",4,mtms2007-09-118a,,

Then I ask two students to come to the board to model examples: One student reads the notes and directs each step that the other student takes. I interject a little bit of theatrics and humor to stress that students must start with a positive attitude. This instruction helps them remember to begin by facing the positive direction on the number line. The students then model several examples like those in figure 2. We then move outside. Groups of two to three students use sidewalk chalk to draw number lines. After checking each number line, I give each group several cards containing addition and subtraction problems involving integers that are either in real contexts or as numerical expressions to simplify. Students refer to their notes to begin walking off the problems. The activity requires two to three jobs or roles that rotate among students (reader/director, walker, and/or verifier), and students must agree as a group that the process was done correctly for each problem. When we return to the classroom, the students draw number lines on paper. In so doing, they are gaining practice indicating the direction of travel using their pencils as arrows to transfer their new skills to increasingly abstract levels. ",6,mtms2007-09-118a,,
"When my students are ready, we complete part 3 (the student notes  for multiplication and division,  fig. 1), model examples like those in figure 3, and then practice outside as before.

let’s get connected,39,mtms2007-09-118a,,
"Students who have learned through traditional methods often lack strategies for recalling the correct process, because they try to access memorized rules (NCTM 2000). The Walk It Off method helps students make mathematical connections by developing a conceptual understanding based on the sign and absolute value of a number. Students construct these connections through multisensory experiences as advocated by brain-based learning research: “When objects and events are registered by several senses they can be stored in several interrelated memory networks. A memory stored in this way becomes more accessible and powerful” (Sylwester 1995, p. 9). A teacher might spend two days with a traditional textbook teaching addition and subtraction of integers separately because of the disconnected processes. With the Walk It Off method, those same two days are spent teaching a coherent system. This allows students to spend more time learning each operation. Consequently, more of my students demonstrate proficiency on written examinations than they did before I used the approach. ",40,mtms2007-09-118a,,
"The Walk It Off method follows one consistent process for each operation using the principle of opposites (and always starting with a positive attitude). For the problem 3 × -2, the student starts on 0, turns once, and lands on -6. Similarly, for the problem -3 × -2, the student starts on 0, turns twice, and lands on 6. For the problem 4 – 3, a student starts on 4 and since there is one negative, subtraction, or opposite symbol after the 4, the student turns the opposite direction once, then walks 3 units in the direction he or she faced, landing on 1. Similarly, for -2 − -4, the student starts on -2 and turns the opposite direction twice, because there are two negative symbols after the -2. This means the student  makes a complete turn and ends facing the positive direction in which he or she started, then walks 4 spaces to land on the number 2. Through this process, students have experiences that support the development of the definition of subtraction. Students are not told to change the subtraction sign and the negative sign to positives (-2 + +4). Instead, they decide how to represent this process symbolically in a way that makes sense to them. Consequently, the Walk It Off method, in addition to being more kinesthetic, is also more concrete and coherent than other methods.",41,mtms2007-09-118a,,
More process standards,42,mtms2007-09-118a,,
"This method makes it easier for students to explore integers using the Process Standards of Reasoning and Proof, Problem Solving, Communication, and Representation. The discovery questions in part 4 (fig. 4) ask students to explore ideas, make conjectures, and justify their reasoning. Often students who have learned through traditional means are confused as to whether a rule applies to addition and subtraction or division and multiplication, so question D is included to help students explore these ideas and prevent or address misconceptions. Question E asks students to devise their own examples before making and testing a conjecture. In this way, students physically experience the sum of two opposites because they always land on 0 (see example A,  fig. 2). In addition, this method helps students discover that subtracting a number is the same as adding the opposite of the number (fig. 4, question F). Since students kinesthetically experience the same process for both problems (6 – 2 and 6 + -2), they discover for themselves that the two symbolic representations are actually equivalent. These experiences provide a conceptual  foundation on which students can build when asked to work together to simplify more difficult problems such as -2.75 − 1.5 or -63 + 45. Students generate and communicate their own solutions, which provides opportunities for them to share multiple strategies. They can even develop efficient algorithms for these more difficult problems through mathematical discourse, rather than by memorizing paper-and-pencil algorithms that they are likely to forget.",43,mtms2007-09-118a,,

"The method described in this article has solidified skills and improved long-term retention for almost all my students, including those who have memory deficits, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and learning disabilities. In particular, those students who previously tried to learn to use integers through traditional methods appreciate the power of the Walk It Off method. My colleagues agree that this method is very effective with students of various ages and skill levels. So the next time you teach integers, grab some sidewalk chalk and Walk It Off.  references National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM). Principles and Standards for School Mathematics.
