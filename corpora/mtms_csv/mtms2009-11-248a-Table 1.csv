"Timber companies want to know the amount of usable wood that can be obtained from a tree. The amount of lumber (usable wood) is a volume measured in units called board feet. One board foot contains 144 cubic inches of sawed lumber, or the equivalent of a board 1 inch thick, 12 inches wide, and 12 inches long. ",2,mtms2009-11-248a,,
"Several methods are used to  calculate board feet, which must, by necessity, be estimates. It is assumed that some of the tree will be unusable because boards must be straight and a single measure for the diameter is given instead of taking into account the way the cut tree trunk tapers (the diameter at one end of the log is smaller than at the other end). Another factor is the width of the saw blade because wood is actually lost by cutting it (just think of the pile of sawdust on the floor after cutting). ",3,mtms2009-11-248a,,
One of the most common methods  of estimating board feet is called the Doyle rule: ,4,mtms2009-11-248a,,
"Another common method is the International rule, which assumes that the log is 8 feet long: board feet = 0.44d 2 – 1.20d – 0.3",5,mtms2009-11-248a,,

PRoBleMs 1.  A log is 8 feet long. One end has a diameter that measures 12 inches; the other end has a diameter of 16 inches. Calculate the amount of board feet using both the Doyle rule and the International rule.  2.  A log is 10 feet long. Its small end has a diameter of 1.2 feet; the large end has a diameter of 1.5 feet. Calculate the board feet using the Doyle rule.  3.  How can you use the International  rule for the log in question 2? Calculate the board feet using your answer.  4.  The International rule is considered to be more accurate.

"Math toPics addRessed: • Using formulas •  Converting between different  units of measurement • Using estimation for a calculation might someone use the Doyle rule instead? 5.  A logger is considering cutting a tree. He estimates the diameter to be 15 inches. He knows this tree is only worth cutting if he can produce at least 74 board feet. How tall must the tree be if the logger is to cut it? (Use the Doyle rule.) challenge The actual volume of a log is found by using the formula for a truncated cone (a cone with the tip cut off ). This formula is where r = the measure of the small end radius in inches, R = the measure of the large end radius in inches, and h = the height in inches. This gives the volume in cubic inches. To convert from cubic inches to board feet, divide by 144 (1 cubic board foot).",10,mtms2009-11-248a,,

Doyle rule: Use d = 12, which is the  smaller diameter, and l = 8 to find: and convert the length as a linear measure:    So l ≈ 9.785 feet, which should be  the minimum height of the tree.",14,mtms2009-11-248a,,

"4.  Answers will vary. The International rule is limiting, because it only applies to an 8 foot log. Since the Doyle rule takes the length of the log into consideration, it may be preferable.",16,mtms2009-11-248a,,
"5.  Substitute the diameter, 15 inches, and the number of board feet that is the goal, 74, into the formula and find the height as the length of the log, as follows: challenge 6.  Using the formula and the given diameters of 12 and 16, half the diameters provide the radii for use in the formula: 7.  Remember that a board foot is a cubic unit of 12 × 12 × 1 inches, so 1 board foot = 144 cubic inches. The volume of the log is 14,878.6/144 ≈ 103.3 board feet. Since, by the International rule, this log provides 48.66 board feet, 103.3 – 48.66 ≈ 54.6 board feet was unused. This is 54.6/103.3 ≈ 53% wasted wood.",17,mtms2009-11-248a,,
