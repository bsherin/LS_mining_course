"When a house is remodeled, it may involve replacing or adding a staircase. Mike Holmes, a Canadian contractor, describes a comfortable staircase as one in which the sum of the step  (or tread) depth and twice the stair height (or rise) is as close to 25 as possible (Huber 2011). See the  diagram below.",3,mtms2012-09-128a,,
2. a. Create an algebraic model for this situation.  b. Graph the model on a rectangular coordinate system. Identify the region of the graph that would give a  “reasonable” set of stairs.  c. Define “reasonable” set of stairs. Explain your reasoning about the definition.,4,mtms2012-09-128a,,
"3. Mr. Holmes describes 1 set of  comfortable stairs as having a tread depth of 10 inches and a rise of  7 3/4 inches. Do these stairs satisfy your model and restrictions? Where are these stairs on your graph? 4. a. What is the rate of change for the height of a stair, given its tread depth?  b. Where is this rate in your algebraic model? Where is it in your graph?  5. a. Are the conditions for a comfortable staircase proportional? If so, what is the constant of proportionality? b. What does it mean in the context of the problem? proBleMs 1. a. Create at least 4 number pairs for which the sum of the tread and twice the rise are as close to 25 as possible.",5,mtms2012-09-128a,,
b. Is the phrase “as close to” necessary in the context of the problem? Justify your response.,6,mtms2012-09-128a,,
