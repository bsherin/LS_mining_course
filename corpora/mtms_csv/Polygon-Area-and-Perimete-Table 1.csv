8,Polygon Area and Perimeter - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The Polygon Area and Perimeter task encouraged students to make and test conjectures and to look for relationships, similarities, and differences among polygons. It also addressed one of the Common Cores Standards for Mathematical Practice (SMP), in particular, SMP 3 (to construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others). We felt that this problem would require students to thoughtfully review and think more deeply about the measurement of area and perimeter as well as the properties of polygons. We will share the work of eighth-grade students in Kathy Strunks class along with the work of preservice elementary teachers.",,
9,Polygon Area and Perimeter - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,STUDENT STRATEGIES AND THINKING,,
10,Polygon Area and Perimeter - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The task asked students to draw, to scale, polygons with the same area. The eighth graders chose to draw their polygons on graph paper because it was easy to determine the lengths of the base and height of each figure by using a grid. Although there were some errors in their drawings, most of the students clearly demonstrated that they knew and could use the formulas for area to draw the three different polygonsa triangle, a rectangle, and a trapezoidof equal area. These eighth graders then used properties of the polygons as well as the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the lengths of the angled sides of the triangles and trapezoids. The preservice teachers used rulers to create their polygons, then just directly measured the lengths of the unknown sides. This resulted in differences in accuracy among their results. As compared with the preservice teachers, the eighth graders answers for perimeter were often more accurate.",,
11,Polygon Area and Perimeter - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Many students, regardless of the group, used examples in which the rectangle and trapezoid they drew had measures of base and height that were close together. However, after examining the set of polygons drawn by each of these students, we found at least one set that showed each of the three different polygons to have the largest perimeter.",,
12,Polygon Area and Perimeter - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"As we continued to look at students second set of polygons, it was apparent that most had not considered how the perimeter would change if the difference of the measure of the base and heights varied. One eighth grader, Balin, did realize that the results would be quite different and said, The more the difference between height and width in a rectangle, the bigger the perimeter will be. This goes for all of these shapes as shown in rectangles A and B (see Balins work in fig. 1). Steven also understood this idea, as evidenced by his statements in figure 2.",,
13,Polygon Area and Perimeter - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
14,Polygon Area and Perimeter - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
15,Polygon Area and Perimeter - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"There were also at least two other eighth graders who were moving toward the idea that having the base and altitude closer in measure would produce smaller perimeters for single polygonal shapes of equal area. They were describing this relationship between the dimensions, in terms of being closer to a circular shape. They apparently knew that to get the largest area enclosed by a given perimeter, the figure should be circular. Paulinka conjectured that the closer a shape is to the circle, the less perimeter it has. Another student provided the diagram in figure 3. However, neither student provided justification for this conjecture.",,
16,Polygon Area and Perimeter - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
17,Polygon Area and Perimeter - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Many of the middle school students conjectured that the triangle would have the largest perimeter because of its sloped, or slanted, lines. They reasoned that the hypotenuse was always longer than either side in a right triangle, so these slanted sides would make the perimeters of the triangles larger. In contrast, preservice teachers conjectured that the trapezoid would have the largest perimeter. They may have used similar reasoning in saying that the trapezoid had two of these sloped, or slanted, sides that were each a hypotenuse of a right triangle, so they were longer than either leg.",,
18,Polygon Area and Perimeter - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Others in each group were hesitant to provide any conjecture because they recognized that they had not found a consistent pattern. One preservice teacher, Katelyn, made a conjecture that area and perimeter are not always going to stay relative to shape. Less area doesnt always mean less perimeter. Meanwhile, some others reduced their conjecture in terms of just two polygons. James, one of the preservice teachers, suggested that the triangle is always larger (in terms of its perimeter) than the square.",,
19,Polygon Area and Perimeter - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"It should be noted that the pre-service teachers were given this Solve It task as an extra-credit item on an exam, with no opportunity to compare their examples or discuss their thinking. However, the students in Strunks class worked in groups and shared their conjectures. Therefore, these student groupings contained a much wider range of sample polygons, which helped the students test more of their conjectures using one anothers work. As Strunk pointed out in her reflection about their work, Just when they [students] thought they had found a relationship, someone found a counterexample. One student, Nathan, gave this explanation,",,
20,Polygon Area and Perimeter - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"My conjecture is that no matter what you do, the trapezoid will have the greatest perimeter. I could test this by making many different trapezoids, so I can compare them to each other. If one finds a trapezoid that shows an area that is not the greatest in perimeter in a set of a triangle and a rectangle, then my conjecture is incorrect.",,
21,Polygon Area and Perimeter - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,This idea of one counterexample disproving the conjecture was an important idea for students to understand.,,
22,Polygon Area and Perimeter - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,OUR REFLECTION ON THE TASK,,
23,Polygon Area and Perimeter - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"This task should have been easy to differentiate because all students should have been able to draw at least three polygons with the same areas. However, we received very few submissions from the field. We are left to conjecture about the reasons for this. It may be that the multiple parts made teachers hesitant to attack the problem or that the lack of a concrete relationship to discover was disconcerting. If you have suggestions for improving this task, feel free to send them to us.",,
24,Polygon Area and Perimeter - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We would like to thank Kathy Strunk, who teaches at Jefferson Middle School in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, for sending us student work and reflections for this Solve It problem. The willingness of teachers and students to share their students work and their use of the task with MTMS readers benefits the mathematics education profession. It also allows us to provide other middle school math teachers with insights into the use of nontraditional tasks and into the thinking of students.",,
