0,Letters from Our Readers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,RESPONSES TO “TWELVE RULES”,,
1,Letters from Our Readers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Ed. note: Readers had various responses to the article that appeared in the November 2015 issue, “12 Rules That Expire in the Middle Grades,” by Karen S. Karp, Sarah B. Bush, and Barbara J. Dougherty (pp. 208–15). The MTMS blog, Blogarithm, also discussed this article; view at http://www.nctm.org/12rules.",,
2,Letters from Our Readers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Thank you so much for this article! I teach algebra 2, precalculus, and calculus, and I fight these issues on a daily basis, especially in algebra 2.",,
3,Letters from Our Readers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,I have some additional thoughts for a few of the rules and a few more issues that I have fought repeatedly over the years.,,
4,Letters from Our Readers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,3. More on Absolute Value,,
5,Letters from Our Readers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"My students have the wrong idea that “absolute value makes everything positive.” When we’re solving absolute value equations, they automatically want to change |x – 3| to x + 3. Why? Because it “absolutely makes everything positive.” This is actually a PEMDAS issue, as well.",,
6,Letters from Our Readers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,5. More on PEMDAS,,
7,Letters from Our Readers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In addition to thinking that multiplication comes before division and addition before subtraction and not understanding that the P means grouping symbols, in general, students forget that parentheses can be used for multiplication and not just grouping. For example, I have students who want to call “P, Parentheses” as the first operation in simplifying an expression like 2 + 3(7). Yes, there are parentheses, but they aren’t the P in PEMDAS. I have seen GEMS (Groupings, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Subtraction and Addition) help students with the hierarchy, as well. With this model, multiplication implies division and subtraction implies addition.",,
8,Letters from Our Readers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,I believe that there are additional rules that expire:,,
9,Letters from Our Readers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,• Reducing fractions: “Cross out what is the same.” This approach is a problem when students start simplifying rational expressions in algebra like,,
10,Letters from Our Readers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
11,Letters from Our Readers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"They want to cross out the x2 terms “because they match,” instead of factoring and allowing the division to cancel common factors.",,
12,Letters from Our Readers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"• “Mixed numbers” are better than “improper fractions”: Although mixed numbers definitely help students reason about the value of an improper fraction, when it comes to performing operations on fractions, improper is definitely the more useful form, and decimal approximations are rarely used.",,
13,Letters from Our Readers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,• Remainders as decimals: The fraction form of a remainder is much more valuable in algebra than a decimal approximation.,,
14,Letters from Our Readers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"• Cross multiply: Students overgeneralize the “cross multiplying” concept and want to use it all the time, especially with multiplying fractions.",,
15,Letters from Our Readers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,• Inequalities: The alligator mouth eats the bigger value. This lets them get by in lower grades without actually learning how to read the less than and greater than symbols.,,
16,Letters from Our Readers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Again, I thank the authors for writing this article and NCTM for publishing it and soliciting input from readers.",,
17,Letters from Our Readers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Lori Burch,,
18,Letters from Our Readers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Bloomfield Junior/Senior High School,,
19,Letters from Our Readers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Bloomfield, Indiana",,
20,Letters from Our Readers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,I am writing about the “12 Rules That Expire” article in MTMS.,,
21,Letters from Our Readers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"First, I would disagree with the comment on the usage for “point” as discussed in table 2 (see p. 214): “Using point to read a decimal, such as ‘three point four’ for 3.4.” In the elementary school phase, it makes sense to say 3.4 as “three and four-tenths” because of the goal of preparing students for fractions. But at higher levels—certainly by high school—“three point four” is no more mysterious, incomprehensible, or potentially fraught with pitfalls than the numerical expression of 3.4 itself. At that stage of the game, it is ubiquitous that “three point four” means 3.4. In fact, I would say that the recommendation to say “three and four-tenths” itself expires by high school: There is no way that I am going to read 0.1453948 as a fraction to my students in class. I’m saying “point-blah-blah-blah” or perhaps even “zero-point-blah-blah-blah.”",,
22,Letters from Our Readers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Second, I had to laugh out loud when I saw “Reducing fractions” replaced with “simplifying fractions” or possibly “fraction in simplest form” (see also table 2 on p. 214). I sat through a discussion led by educators and test-makers who were backing the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics in which those leading the discussion were adamant in excising the word “simple” and its derivatives (“simplest,” “simplify,” and “simplifying”) from the curriculum on the basis that the words were too vague, overused, too context-dependent, and imprecise. The presenters said that they actually followed a test-item drafting rule that required that they never use a derivative of “simple” in the prompt of a test question (e.g., “simplify the polynomial expression” needed to be changed to the wordier “write the polynomial expression in standard form” and—which is why I laughed—“simplify the fraction” needed to be changed to “write the reduced fraction” or “write the fraction in lowest terms”). I laugh because apparently not all math reformers are on the same page.",,
23,Letters from Our Readers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Last, in a comment to the article by Sue Mascioli (see the blog post of 11/3/2015 11:49 AM at http://www.nctm.org/12rules), she suggests that remainders disappear after the elementary grades and that division be taught with the requirement to express remainders as fractions. As a Secondary Math 3/Precalculus instructor, I would add that remainders reappear later in polynomial division: in long division, in the remainder theorem (the functional value is equal to the remainder of the polynomial divided by the linear factor that accompanies the root), and in the synthetic division algorithm that is useful for locating roots of higher degree polynomials. It is very useful to demonstrate to students that polynomial division works exactly the same as the long division they did back in elementary school, even up to the choice of how to write a remainder: as a remainder itself or as a fraction with the divisor as the denominator.",,
24,Letters from Our Readers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In my experience, I would say that both methods of writing remainders should continue to be taught from the beginning—the remainder concept doesn’t expire like Sue thinks it does; it just takes a while before it resurfaces later in polynomial division.",,

27,Letters from Our Readers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"West Valley City, Utah",,
28,Letters from Our Readers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"When I taught grades 6, 7, and 8 and algebra 1 (in a private school), we had a “retirement party” in sixth grade for the × symbol as a multiplication sign. It was a great way to help students make the jump to using x as a variable and using different representations for multiplication. We only “retired” × because we would still use it in scientific notation.",,
29,Letters from Our Readers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"A rule I have run across that I would like to expire is KCC, or “keep, change, change,” when subtracting with integers. I emphasize to my students that you “add the opposite,” which is the mathematical process. I think it is also problematic to tell students that you can determine which way the ray for graphing an inequality should go by matching the direction of the symbol with the shape of the arrow on the number line. It only works if the variable is on the left side, which is not always the case. I also agree with Lori Burch about “cross multiply.” If I had a quarter for every time my eighth graders and algebra 1 students (boo-hoo) tell me that you multiply fractions by cross multiplying, I could retire tomorrow!",,

31,Letters from Our Readers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Wilson Middle School,,
32,Letters from Our Readers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Fishersville, Virginia",,
33,Letters from Our Readers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,I loved the article on expired math language. Here are a couple more that might fit well within that list:,,
34,Letters from Our Readers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,• “Turn-around rule” for commutative property: Some math pro- grams introduce age-appropriate terms to replace mathematical terminology. It is important that students understand what the commutative property is.,,
35,Letters from Our Readers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"• “Number model” or “number sentence” in place of equation and inequality: The word “equation,” in my opinion, should really be used from first grade on. Students need to know that if it has an equal sign, it is an equation.",,
36,Letters from Our Readers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"• “Plus,” “minus,” and “times” as verbs (or action words): By the second grade, it is time for students to use the terms “add” and “subtract” correctly.",,
37,Letters from Our Readers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I have had eighth graders come to my class using phrases like, “Then you times it by six,” which drives me crazy. Likewise, I have heard fourth-grade teachers say to students, “Don’t forget to minus the eight.” We really need to model the correct use of mathematical terms to our students, and teach it, too.",,
38,Letters from Our Readers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Last, although many of the article’s examples have middle school expiration dates, I wonder if we ought to be encouraging K–grade 6 teachers to incorporate the correct use of math terms in their classes, as well, to prepare students for middle school and more advanced math.",,

40,Letters from Our Readers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Regional School Unit 5,,
41,Letters from Our Readers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Freeport, Pownal, and Durham, Maine",,
42,Letters from Our Readers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Thank you, thank you, thank you for one of the best and most relevant articles I’ve seen in MTMS! I am a seventh-grade math teacher at a grades 7–12 independent school, working with students from a diverse collection of sixth grades. The biggest hurdle I have in teaching them pre-algebra is dealing with these “12 rules” and the students’ firm hold on “My old teacher taught me. . . .”",,
43,Letters from Our Readers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In fact, on the same day that this article appeared in my mailbox, I lamented to a colleague that I wish we didn’t teach PEMDAS anymore. I used it because it is familiar to all my students, but three weeks after this usage, they were still fighting me to break the “do all the multiplication, then all the division” habit.",,
44,Letters from Our Readers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Thanks to you, next year, no PEMDAS in my classroom! I plan to share this article with my students and their parents.",,

47,Letters from Our Readers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Carlsbad, California",,
48,Letters from Our Readers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Hooray! Thank you for this concise list of mathematical misrepresentations perpetrated on students, even in elementary school.",,
49,Letters from Our Readers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Some of these “rules” are just wrong mathematically. And rule 10 (use keywords to solve word problems) begins way back in the primary grades.,,
50,Letters from Our Readers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"As a trainer for elementary grade teachers, I am always dismayed by the widespread use of “keywords” to interpret word problems. I encourage teachers to have students approach word problems like they would a little story. “Who did/has what?” “Then what happened?” “More” does not always mean “add” (as in “How many more crayons does Max have than Ella?”).",,
51,Letters from Our Readers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Some of my favorite generalizations from students who were taught the “keyword” way are these:,,
52,Letters from Our Readers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"1. “If you see the word more, just add.”",,
53,Letters from Our Readers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"2. “If eating is going on, subtract.”",,
54,Letters from Our Readers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"3. “If both numbers are small, multiply.”",,
55,Letters from Our Readers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"4. “If one is small and one is big, divide.”",,
56,Letters from Our Readers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"5. “If both numbers are big, you just have to guess. Unless there is eating or spending.”",,
57,Letters from Our Readers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Promoting reading comprehension (visualizing the story) in the math content area is a promising approach to ease elementary grade teachers away from teaching the “keywords” way.,,

60,Letters from Our Readers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Palo Alto, California",,
61,Letters from Our Readers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The March 2011 issue of MTMS contained an article titled “The Truth about PEMDAS,” by Jerry A. Ameis (pp. 414–20). This article advocated an alternative method of teaching PEMDAS that I believe will help prevent some of the misconceptions that will later cause this methodology to expire.",,
62,Letters from Our Readers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I think that the Karp, Bush, and Dougherty article provided great insight into the misconceptions that are common at the middle grades level, but I fear that teaching students that rules “expire” could have a negative impact on their interest and confidence in the subject. Instead, I think it is our job to teach concepts rather than rules because concepts can be built on. As middle level educators, we lack control of students’ prior knowledge, yet I believe we should work to build relationships with teachers from lower grade levels to help ensure that statements such as “yours is not to reason why, just invert and multiply” are not used as an easy way out for teachers.",,
