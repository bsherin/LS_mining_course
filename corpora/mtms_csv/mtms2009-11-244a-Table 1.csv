It is crucial that ELLs understand task requirements, realize how to get necessary resources, and process specific mathematics vocabulary before working on a group task.",0,mtms2009-11-244a,,
"Having students work in groups  can be challenging at the middle school level, particularly if they have not had an opportunity to do so in elementary school. However, this practice can be very effective with students at this age. Students at the middle school level place a great deal of importance on being part of the group. It also enables them to learn that they can work, as well as socialize, with their peers. ",1,mtms2009-11-244a,,

"It is important to monitor the process when using cooperative groups. Although students are working, teachers can circulate among groups and observe and record student interactions. Asking students to write in a math journal or notebook is a way to assess individual understanding. Some possible writing prompts include  these:  •	 Write	a	letter	to	someone	in	 another class explaining why the group’s strategy worked.  •	 What	would	happen	if	you	 changed the variable to ______? •	 How	would	you	rate	your	group’s	 interaction on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 demonstrating everyone’s involvement? •	 What	was	the	hardest	part	about	 working in a group on this task? What	was	the	easiest	part?",4,mtms2009-11-244a,,
