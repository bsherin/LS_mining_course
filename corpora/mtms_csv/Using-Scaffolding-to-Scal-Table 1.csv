0,Using Scaffolding to Scale-up Justifications - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Open-ended mathematical tasks provide great opportunities for students to engage in authentic mathematical practices, such as conjecturing, generalizing, and justifying. When students solve nonroutine problems, they must develop their own strategies, draw on different areas of mathematics content knowledge, and assess the validity of their solutions (Hiebert et al. 1996).",,
1,Using Scaffolding to Scale-up Justifications - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Supporting students in open-ended tasks can be challenging. As teachers, we need to guide students toward the important mathematics of the task while allowing room for exploration. Appropriate scaffolding of a task has been linked to more opportunities for student learning and better student solutions (Mayer 2004; Henningsen and Stein 1997). But what does effective scaffolding look like? If there is too much structure, you give away the answers; if there is too little structure, it can lead to unsystematic exploration (Henningsen and Stein 1997; Hsu et al. 2009). We focused on how best to structure a scaling task to support student justifications.",,
2,Using Scaffolding to Scale-up Justifications - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The JAGUAR project (Justification and Argumentations: Growing Understanding of Algebraic Reasoning) was a collaborative research and professional project that investigated justification in middle school classrooms. Each teacher implemented four justification tasks over one school year. After discussion and reflection, those same tasks were implemented a second time the next school year, with some modifications.",,
3,Using Scaffolding to Scale-up Justifications - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"One such problem was a task that explored how scaling the side lengths of two-dimensional figures impacted the area of the scaled-up figure. For example, suppose we start with a square with side lengths of 1 unit. If we scale up each side to be three times as long, the scaled-up square has an area that is nine times larger than the original, not three times larger, as students might expect (see fig. 1).",,

5,Using Scaffolding to Scale-up Justifications - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Our goal in the first year was for students to discover patterns in the relationship between scaling side lengths and the resulting area. In the second year, we shifted our math objective toward explaining why the relationship held, which improved student justifications. The tasks were implemented with different eighth-grade students from year to year, but the school and context remained the same.",,
6,Using Scaffolding to Scale-up Justifications - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,YEAR 1: WHAT HAPPENED,,
7,Using Scaffolding to Scale-up Justifications - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Students explored the side lengths and areas for many different figures and many different scale factors. Figure 2 displays the first-year task. The primary mathematical goal was for students to understand the relationship between scale factor and area of similar shapes by making observations about the numeric patterns. In addition, we expected students to generalize the relationship to any two-dimensional figure. While lesson planning, we decided among ourselves that requiring a justification will give students an opportunity to elaborate on observations they make about numeric patterns, so that they can construct the relationship between scale factor and area of similar shapes. Justification will also help students build the bridge between generalization and application.",,
8,Using Scaffolding to Scale-up Justifications - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
9,Using Scaffolding to Scale-up Justifications - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The task prompted students to begin by filling in a table of the side lengths and areas of different shapes for different scale factors (see fig. 2). This table structure allowed students to work with the data to observe a pattern in the numerical values. By exploring a variety of different shapes, students could generalize their findings for other figures. In addition to filling out the table, students were asked:",,
10,Using Scaffolding to Scale-up Justifications - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,1. What relationship do you notice between the scale factor and how the area changes from the original shape to each new shape?,,
11,Using Scaffolding to Scale-up Justifications - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"2. Explain how (and why, if you can) this relationship works.",,
12,Using Scaffolding to Scale-up Justifications - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In a follow-up task, students were asked to apply what they had learned to an irregularly shaped figure (see fig. 3).",,
13,Using Scaffolding to Scale-up Justifications - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
14,Using Scaffolding to Scale-up Justifications - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Stein et al. (2000) described procedures with connections, or a high-level cognitive demand task. Procedures with connections tasks focus students attention on the use of procedures for the purpose of developing deeper levels of understanding of mathematical concepts and ideas. In this case, the procedure used familiar formulas to calculate areas of two-dimensional figures. Students then used those calculations to discover the relationship between the area of a figure and the area of a similar, scaled-up figure.",,
15,Using Scaffolding to Scale-up Justifications - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"However, this task did not lend itself to strong student justifications. Many factors might have contributed to weak student justifications, such as holes in students understanding of prerequisite material or not enough time to complete the task. However, in this case, we authors agreed that the primary reason that students did not provide strong justifications was because of the structure of the written task, not the enactment. The task led students to focus on the pattern of numbers in the table and did not help students see how those patterns were formed.",,
16,Using Scaffolding to Scale-up Justifications - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
17,Using Scaffolding to Scale-up Justifications - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Although most students were able to see some type of relationship in the table, such as the student who noted that as the figures side lengths increased, the area also increased (see fig. 4), others were able to generalize the relationship in terms of algebraic equations, but they could not explain why the relationship held. One student recognized that the area of the scaled-up figure would be equal to the area of the original figure multiplied by the square of the scale factor (see fig. 5). However, this individual was unable to support his reasoning with either a geometric or algebraic argument. In this task, students frequently engaged in a specific type of empirical reasoning called result-pattern reasoning (Harel 2001), in which students see a pattern in a set of examples and then assume that the pattern must hold without explaining why.",,
18,Using Scaffolding to Scale-up Justifications - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
19,Using Scaffolding to Scale-up Justifications - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Reflecting on the task, we found that the structure was too focused on finding patterns in the table of numbers. Although students were able to figure out that a pattern existed, they were unable to explain why the pattern held. After the first implementation of the task, one teacher reflected, I felt like I moved on from the squares [and rectangles] too quickly. The way that we designed and implemented this task didnt allow for enough exploration and discussion about why the scale factor/area relationship works.",,
20,Using Scaffolding to Scale-up Justifications - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,YEAR 2: WHAT HAPPENED,,
21,Using Scaffolding to Scale-up Justifications - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"From our experiences with the task in the first year, we made a number of revisions to encourage students to better justify why the relationship between the scale factor and the area held. The revisions began with a shift in the mathematical goals away from generalizing on the basis of number patterns and toward understanding why the pattern existed, using both algebraic and geometric representations. Before assigning the task, we reflected that the goal in the previous year was for students to be able to generalize this relationship. We decided that the focus for the next year would involve students understanding the relationship.",,
22,Using Scaffolding to Scale-up Justifications - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"For the second years implementation of the task, we decided to spend the first day of the task just exploring the scaling of a single square. Rather than jumping straight into creating a table, students were encouraged to justify their reasoning for each calculation at the start of the task. (See fig. 6 for part 1 of the task.) After students made an in-depth investigation of scaling the square, they were given a second task in which they explored other shapes. Students were encouraged to support their reasoning with pictures as well as tables and equations.",,
23,Using Scaffolding to Scale-up Justifications - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
24,Using Scaffolding to Scale-up Justifications - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The justifications that students produced during the second year of the task were very different from those of the first year. For example, Nate (a pseudonym, as are all the names in this article) gave a pictorial argument for the relationship between the area of the original square and a scaled-up square (see fig. 7). The original square is in the bottom-left corner of his diagram. Nate explained that as you scale it up by seven, It will be seven times as big in both directions, and thus the total new area will be 7  7, or 49, times the original area. Nate was one of several students who shared their justifications with the class.",,
25,Using Scaffolding to Scale-up Justifications - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
26,Using Scaffolding to Scale-up Justifications - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The next class day, students were asked to create rules for different shapes of their choosing, such as rectangles, squares, and parallelograms. Clay used a shape to model his justification for the scaling of a parallelogram from Nates justification the previous day (see fig. 8):",,
27,Using Scaffolding to Scale-up Justifications - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
28,Using Scaffolding to Scale-up Justifications - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Clay: All right, I got original area times scale factor squared.",,
29,Using Scaffolding to Scale-up Justifications - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Teacher: OK. And can you explain your picture? Why that works there?,,
30,Using Scaffolding to Scale-up Justifications - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Clay: Uh, this is the original one right there [pointing to the bottom-left parallelogram]. That one is the original and then times 2, 3, 4 . . . [outlining each scaled-up parallelogram on his drawing as he counted]. And then times 3 squared would be 9.",,
31,Using Scaffolding to Scale-up Justifications - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Because students were given time to explore the relationship of the square in depth, they were better prepared to apply this understanding to new shapes the second day of the task. Nates justification for a square from the previous day served as a model for other students justifications for different shapes.",,
32,Using Scaffolding to Scale-up Justifications - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Another student used a picture and named a rectangle Tangle to explain how to connect an algebraic equation to the shapes, justifying how the area of a 2  6 rectangle would be affected by scaling the lengths of the sides (see fig. 9). This student explained the rule by saying that the scale factor squared then multiplied by Tangles area [results in the] new area. This statement was demonstrated in the picture of Tangle scaled by a factor of 2. Notice that this student found the same rule as students from the previous year. However, unlike what occurred the previous year, he was able to use a diagram and explain why the rule held.",,

34,Using Scaffolding to Scale-up Justifications - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,WHAT DID WE LEARN?,,
35,Using Scaffolding to Scale-up Justifications - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Reflecting on the task construction between year 1 and year 2 led us to a number of conclusions about how best to design tasks that support student justification.,,
36,Using Scaffolding to Scale-up Justifications - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"1.  Take your time with the initial steps: Intentionally designing the task to explore one example in detail helped students to understand why something worked in a single case. In the second year of the task, students were more prepared to form generalizations about what would happen with any scale factor when they had thought more deeply about what was happening with one particular scale factor (see fig. 10).",,
37,Using Scaffolding to Scale-up Justifications - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
38,Using Scaffolding to Scale-up Justifications - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"2.  Ask students to justify early and often: Ask students to justify their reasoning when exploring the early computational parts of a task. We waited until the end of a task to ask students to justify, and they were more reluctant to fully describe their thinking because they had already found the solution. In the second year, we asked students to justify at every stage (see fig. 11). Starting with justifications for concrete examples helped lead to stronger justifications for the general case.",,
39,Using Scaffolding to Scale-up Justifications - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
40,Using Scaffolding to Scale-up Justifications - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,3.  Prompt students to use multiple representations: Ask students to represent their thinking explicitly with a picture (see fig. 12). This can help deepen students understanding of relationships. It will also help when they communicate their understanding to other students. Drawing pictures can also help students reflect on their thinking and verify that their calculations align with their mental pictures.,,
41,Using Scaffolding to Scale-up Justifications - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
42,Using Scaffolding to Scale-up Justifications - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"4.  Discuss different strategies: Use class time for structured discussions of different strategies. In the second year of the task, many students were able to use a representation to model their justifications successfully after Nates pictorial argument presented in the first day of the lesson (see fig. 8). Understanding other strategies can help deepen students understanding. It will also give them more tools to use when constructing their own justifications.",,
43,Using Scaffolding to Scale-up Justifications - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"5.  Set expectations high: In the second year of the scaling task, students provided much deeper justifications because we asked for them. Students were expected to justify their initial steps and to include visual representations in their justifications.",,
44,Using Scaffolding to Scale-up Justifications - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"6.  Identifying that a pattern exists is different than understanding why: Although finding patterns in tables of numbers has value, we believe that it is also important for students to understand the mathematics behind why something is true. This mathematical knowledge can help students see how different representations are connected and can help them apply their understanding to other cases or a more general argument. In this particular situation, having a deep understanding of how the square was scaled helped students construct arguments for other shapes, such as parallelograms and rectangles.",,
45,Using Scaffolding to Scale-up Justifications - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In the scaling task, students explored the relationships between side lengths and areas of scaled-up shapes. In the first year of the task, students were directed to find numerical patterns in a table. Although students were able to generate an equation, they could not explain why the equation held. They relied on result-pattern reasoning: They saw a pattern in a set of examples and assumed that the pattern would hold. In the second year, students explored a single shape in detail and were asked to justify early and often using multiple representations. Students were also better able to justify why the relationship held using pictures, equations, and words. By structuring the task to focus on sense making with a single example and frequently prompting for explanations, students provided better justifications and ultimately gained a deeper understanding of the mathematics.",,
