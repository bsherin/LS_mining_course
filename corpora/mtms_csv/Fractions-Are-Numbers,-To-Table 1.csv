However, the more number sense is considered, the more complex it is to truly defi ne, address, and assess. In the middle grades, the emergence of a sense of number with regard to fractions (defi ned here as a/b fractions, decimals, and percentages), or fraction sense, is expected and important as such work with fractions actually launches early and extends students’ experiences with algebra.

15,"Fractions Are Numbers, Too!","A foundational element of fraction sense is for students to recognize and understand that fractions are numbers themselves. Think about the following number analogy. Early learners consider the number 56 as 5 tens and 6 ones, or 50 + 6, and spend time representing such numbers using a variety of physical and, more recently, digital tools. They compare, order, and generally come to understand whole numbers as they begin early work with addition and subtraction.

21,"Fractions Are Numbers, Too!","Understanding fractions as numbers certainly begins with representations of these numbers. Middle-grades students should be provided with many opportunities to represent fractions using a variety of representations  (manipulatives, drawings) or digital tools (e.g., www.conceptuamath.com).

24,"Fractions Are Numbers, Too!","Students need to develop facility with a variety of representations for fractions and decimals. Giving students time to discuss their representations (e.g., representing 5/6 using color tiles or counters or 0.61 using a hundred grid) helps to develop their understanding. For instance, studentcreated drawings may not always portray equal-size parts of a region or number line, or they may lack the  proportionality expected (see fig. 2). Thus, their explanations may be more indicative of understanding than their renderings. Consider how you can build on student-created representations to help them create equivalent fractions and compare and order fractions. Becoming facile with a variety of representations is perhaps the first step in understanding fractions as numbers.  eQUiValent FRactions",24,"Fractions Are Numbers, Too!"
25,"Fractions Are Numbers, Too!","The cornerstone of developing fraction sense is understanding of and proficiency with equivalence. This includes, initially, creating equivalent fractions and extends to understanding decimals and common percentages. As students develop their understanding of equivalence, which actually begins at the elementary school level, they should be able to represent equivalent fractions using regions and the number line as well as mental mathematics.

It will be important for students to understand equivalence whether that is subdividing regions, showing how 1/2 of a region can be halved to show that 1/2 = 2/4, or recognizing that a hundred grid can be shaded, to show that 1/2, 0.5, and  50 percent are equivalent.

39,"Fractions Are Numbers, Too!","In this activity, students informally explored the density of fractions by continuing to halve a cookie, which is yet another important understanding related to fractions as numbers.

Each chocolate bar was the same size. They argued about who ate the most chocolate. Here is what each girl ate:  • Amy: 2/6 of her chocolate bar • Beth: 2/3 of her chocolate bar • Katie: 3/4 of her chocolate bar •  Gretchen: 1/2 of her chocolate bar • Deb: 1/3 of her chocolate bar",51,"Fractions Are Numbers, Too!"

Who ate the least amount of  chocolate? 3.  How could we order what the girls  ate from the least to the greatest amount? 4.  How could you show about how  many chocolate bars were eaten in total?  5.  How much chocolate remains? 6.
