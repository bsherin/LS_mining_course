"Pi, Greek letter (p), is the symbol for the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter. Pi is an irrational number, meaning it will continue infinitely without repeating. It is usually calculated to 3 digits (3.14), but with the use of computers, Pi has been calculated to over 1 trillion digits past the decimal. ",1,mtms2008-03-432a,,
"Although the ratio has been around for about 4,000 years, the symbol p just turned 300 years old in 2006. The symbol for pi was first used in 1706 by a Welsh man, William Jones. The symbol was made popular after Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler adopted its use in 1737. ",2,mtms2008-03-432a,,
