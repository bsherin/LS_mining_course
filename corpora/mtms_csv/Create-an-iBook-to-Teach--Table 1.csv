1,"Create an iBook to Teach Fractions, Decimals, and Percentages - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Digital books, or e-books, have revolutionized the way we access books and information (Santally, Rajabalee, and Cooshna-Naik 2012). Students no longer spend hours paging through books at a library to gather information to write a paper. Now they turn on a computer, tablet, or other mobile device and search the Web. As we continue into the twenty-first century, schools are being encouraged to embrace technology, such as iPads. Such technologies, however, can  present challenges for educators who must learn how to teach with them (Daccord 2012).",,
2,"Create an iBook to Teach Fractions, Decimals, and Percentages - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Many of the e-books currently available for iPads are static and, thus, less appealing to middle school students. An alternative to a static e-book is an interactive textbook designed with iBooks Author, a free Applesoftware program to facilitate the development of interactive books (Apple 2013a). iBooks are digital books that can be read on an iPad or on other Apple devices. iBooks Author allows Mac owners to use the available templates to design their own book. Through iTunes, Apple has begun to publish iBooks written with iBooks Author.",,
3,"Create an iBook to Teach Fractions, Decimals, and Percentages - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","This technology allows teachers to develop textbooks or modular units based on the needs of their students. As a middle school mathematics teacher, I was excited to use this technology to introduce fractions, decimals, and percentages, which are topics that research has shown to be difficult for students (Vendlinski et al. 2011). In addition, I suspected that using technology to teach rational numbers to my sixth-grade students might increase their engagement with and understanding of mathematics.",,
4,"Create an iBook to Teach Fractions, Decimals, and Percentages - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics",WHY DEVELOP AN iBOOK?,,
5,"Create an iBook to Teach Fractions, Decimals, and Percentages - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","An interactive iBook is meant to increase student engagement; therefore, including interactive elements is vital in the development of an iBook. Creating an iBook can be simultaneously intriguing and frustrating. Along the way, issues might arise with the outline, the template, or with developing suitable wording to convey mathematical concepts. However, with these challenges come the freedom to develop a book tailored to the needs of the students in your classroom. Often, traditional textbooks include content for the masses. Teachers may find that either their students already know some of the content or that it is necessary to incorporate supplemental resources to increase understanding of weak skills. With iBooks Author, the teacher maintains the freedom to ensure that each section of the text is meaningful for students and meets their mathematical needs as a group.",,
6,"Create an iBook to Teach Fractions, Decimals, and Percentages - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics",HOW DOES THE iBOOK DIFFER FROM A STANDARD TEXT?,,
7,"Create an iBook to Teach Fractions, Decimals, and Percentages - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","iBooks Author offers a variety of interactive tools, called widgets, to enhance the iBook. These features allow for embedding movies (see fig. 1), photographs, three-dimensional images, PowerPoint slides, websites, scrolling sidebars, and reviews. Although many options are available, including all of the interactive elements is neither necessary nor recommended when first attempting to create an iBook.",,
8,"Create an iBook to Teach Fractions, Decimals, and Percentages - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics",Embedding Links,,
9,"Create an iBook to Teach Fractions, Decimals, and Percentages - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","One of the simplest methods to make an iBook interactive is to embed links. The author simply inserts a gallery from the widgets and pastes the URL into the gallery. A link is then displayed in a small box within the iBook. When the iBook is on an iPad, students can touch the link, which will take them to the provided website, assuming Internet access is available.",,
10,"Create an iBook to Teach Fractions, Decimals, and Percentages - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Choosing websites to include in the iBook can be a challenging endeavor. Because Apple iOS devices do not run Adobe Flash, websites with Flash content will not load on an iPad, although the rest of the page will load. I was discouraged to discover that many of the available games incorporating fractions, decimals, and percentages would not run properly on an iPad. However, static sites were useful in the iBook.",,
11,"Create an iBook to Teach Fractions, Decimals, and Percentages - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","In class, when students select embedded links, they are immediately taken to the linked site that gives more guidance or a video regarding the topic. This path creates resources for students to refer to if they become stuck on a problem. As students become more comfortable in using the resources, they become more confident in their developing skills with fractions, decimals, and percentages.",,
12,"Create an iBook to Teach Fractions, Decimals, and Percentages - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics",Using Review Widgets,,
13,"Create an iBook to Teach Fractions, Decimals, and Percentages - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","The Review widget is another user-friendly interactive feature that allows students to quiz themselves on the material of each lesson. Several variations of the Review widget are available, including multiple choice with text (see fig. 2), multiple choice using pictures, and a drag-and-drop option. Developing review questions allowed me to create materials that included pictures, word problems, and standard mathematical problems.",,
14,"Create an iBook to Teach Fractions, Decimals, and Percentages - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","When students use the widgets, they enjoy the immediate feedback and often learn from finding their own errors. Although Review is a useful feature for students to check their understanding, it would be helpful if students attempts were recorded and emailed to the teacher, thus enabling the teacher to informally assess students. However, Review is a nice feature for self-motivated students who want to ensure that they understand the material.",,
15,"Create an iBook to Teach Fractions, Decimals, and Percentages - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics",Inserting Videos,,
16,"Create an iBook to Teach Fractions, Decimals, and Percentages - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Because most mathematical topics are content specific, it may be best for teachers to create their own videos. Within rational numbers, such topics as percentages smaller than 1 and larger than 100 can be difficult for students. For this reason, creating and inserting a personally designed video seems to be the best method. Before inserting videos, I recorded them on an interactive whiteboard and then added audio to the recording. Programs such as iMovie are useful, but can be time-consuming.",,
17,"Create an iBook to Teach Fractions, Decimals, and Percentages - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","When my students first accessed a video and realized that their teacher had recorded it, they laughed and replayed it several times. However, when they began paying attention to the content, they were able to gain a deeper understanding of the material. While designing the ibook, I considered using text to explain the concept but realized that the difficult content would be understood more easily through video. Students were able to not only listen to their teacher explain the concept but also go back through the material at any time they chose to review the concepts.",,
18,"Create an iBook to Teach Fractions, Decimals, and Percentages - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics",Including a Gallery,,
19,"Create an iBook to Teach Fractions, Decimals, and Percentages - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Creating problems with solutions to insert into a photo gallery can pose difficulties. Because mathematics problems are topic specific, finding problems and solutions in the format needed was typically impossible. Therefore, I had to develop my own problems and solutions. This process included photographing each step of a problem on an interactive whiteboard and uploading the photos to iBooks. Although tedious, the resulting interactive tool allows students to swipe through the solution and view each step (see fig. 3). This tool not only allows students to read for comprehension but also adds a visual aid to assist students in learning the material.",,
20,"Create an iBook to Teach Fractions, Decimals, and Percentages - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Rather than giving only a brief description of a problem as standard textbooks do, I could include pictures with my descriptions. Students were able to swipe between pictures to determine how a problem was solved. In addition, students could use this resource as a reference when they became stuck on a problem.",,
21,"Create an iBook to Teach Fractions, Decimals, and Percentages - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics",USING THE iBOOK IN CLASS,,
22,"Create an iBook to Teach Fractions, Decimals, and Percentages - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","My students were initially apprehensive when I introduced the concept of the iBook in class. However, once they downloaded the ibook and began to understand the features, they were enthralled with the interactive text. As a trial of this text, I allowed students to move through the concepts individually or in small groups as I circulated around the room and helped those who struggled. Students turned in notebooks weekly, so I could determine if they understood the content. We would regularly play group games so I could assess each students understanding.",,
23,"Create an iBook to Teach Fractions, Decimals, and Percentages - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Although students gained an understanding of fractions, decimals, and percentages, I do not feel that this was the most effective teaching method but should be viewed as another way to engage students in learning. Students often mentioned, however, how much they enjoyed being able to go back through the text and look at the videos and problems. However, in my opinion, some direct instruction, without the aid of technology, is still necessary. During the coming school year, I plan to implement the iBook again. However, I plan to use it more for homework and as a resource connected to our learning in the classroom.",,
24,"Create an iBook to Teach Fractions, Decimals, and Percentages - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics",IS USING iBOOKS AUTHOR WORTH THE TIME?,,
25,"Create an iBook to Teach Fractions, Decimals, and Percentages - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Although the technology is free, some teachers might wonder whether using iBooks Author is worth the time it takes. Developing an e-book can be a lengthy endeavor but is well worth the resulting student engagement. As we continue to engage with technology in education, it is likely that digital books will become standard. However, at this stage, many digital textbooks are simply PDFs of print textbooks. iBooks Author allows for individualized textbooks and interaction with the material, which is critical in mathematics. After completing an iBook, a professional digital book is available for students to use and interact with. Revisions can be made quickly and easily for a yearly updated textbook. Digital books are the future, and this future is allowing teachers more control over what and how they teach as technology becomes more integrated into the school systems.",,
