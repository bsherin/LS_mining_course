"Your group is responsible for building a paper table that is strong enough to hold a heavy book, such as your math book. As a design engineer, you can prepare for the project by doing a little research, which will enable you to contribute to your design team to solve the Paper Table problem.  1.  Research questions. Write responses for these questions, and be prepared to discuss your thinking with your design team. If other questions occur, be sure to capture them for team consideration: •	 •	 •	 •	 	What	problem	are	you	trying	to	 solve? What materials will you use? 	What	requirements	must	be	 met? What limitations or  challenges do you see? 	Create	a	sketch	to	capture	 initial ideas to share with your group. What polygons do you plan to use to create the  strongest table? 	Do	the	angle	measures	matter?	",3,mtms2013-02-362z1,,
What about side lengths? 2.  Hold a design team meeting. ,4,mtms2013-02-362z1,,
Nominate a lead designer whose  role is to keep everyone focused and to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to participate: •	 •	 •	 •	 	Share	research	notes	from	all	 team members.,5,mtms2013-02-362z1,,
	Discuss	the	problem	and	 requirements to ensure that all team members understand the problem and requirements to meet for the solution.,6,mtms2013-02-362z1,,
"	Identify	limitations	and	challenges, then brainstorm ideas for overcoming issues.",7,mtms2013-02-362z1,,
	Use	combined	team	research	to	 create or adopt a team member’s sketch for an initial design.,8,mtms2013-02-362z1,,
"3.  Build, test, and redesign. Nominate a building foreman or materials manager.  •	 	Build	the	table	described	by	 your design.  •	 Test	the	model.",9,mtms2013-02-362z1,,
"•	 •	 	Make	recommendations	for	 redesign, if requirements are not met.",10,mtms2013-02-362z1,,
"	Create	and	collect	design	process notes for each model built (the job of the lead designer), including a sketch of each table; problems or defects (what   requirements are not being met?); the refined model design or plan (capture ideas for improving the model); and build or adjust the existing table to meet new design specifications.  4.  Present design team results.  •	 •	 	Describe	your	design	iterations.	",11,mtms2013-02-362z1,,
How did your table design evolve? 	Share	your	final	paper	table	design and test results (these may be presented digitally if equipment is available or a live test or the remnants of the last test may be shown and described if the test was not successful).,12,mtms2013-02-362z1,,
•	 What	did	you	learn? •	 •	 •	 	What	is	most	important	for	 building a strong table? 	What	polygons	offered	the	 greatest	strength?	Did	it	matter	 if the polygon was convex or concave? 	What	would	happen	if	a	 triangle were used? Would it react differently if it were a right triangle versus an obtuse triangle? 	Offer	advice	from	your	experience to other design teams.,13,mtms2013-02-362z1,,
