"As school systems across the nation begin to use a common set of state standards for mathematics, the stakes have never been higher. Curriculum Issues in an Era of Common Core State Standards for Mathematics is a K−grade 12 resource meant to assist states with the implementation of these standards. The content focuses on issues relevant to understanding and putting CCSSM into action. The  book begins with a look at the history of standards, moves on to the current state of CCSSM, and concludes with recommendations for mathematics education. Main issues covered include curriculum coherence, cultivating communities of mathematical practice, strategic use of technology, and learning progressions in mathematics. ",6,mtms2013-05-580a,,
"The book is organized in sections,  with each section beginning with ten (or more) questions for discussion and reflection. These questions are followed by a chapter focused on each grade band: K−5, 6−8, and 9−12. A theme woven throughout is the importance of teachers convening to develop mathematical ideas within grade levels and across grades. This vertical articulation is a strength evident throughout the book. Three case studies are examined to observe teachers working with curriculum materials. Grade appropriate math technology tools are also explored. This would be an excellent resource to use with CCSSM professional development. Four possible professional development models, including district-level and buildinglevel models, are provided. Both the relevance and timeliness make this a must-have resource for all.  —Kay Bennett",7,mtms2013-05-580a,,

"Why would teachers want to participate in professional learning communities? How do educators develop and sustain professional learning communities? Through the lens of mathematics, the NCTM Yearbook explores the fundamentals of professional collaboration and its impact on student learning and teacher practice. ",13,mtms2013-05-580a,,
"The text details high-performing professional learning communities. Collaboration begins by defining team member roles, team norms and protocols, team curricular goals (both horizontal and vertical), and team learning outcomes. Common assessments, including homework, grading, and intervention plans, are examined and refined. Knowing that “student learning is a difficult, complex, and incremental endeavor,” the text incorporates the use of both best practices and data-based decision making to develop reflective practitioners who share leadership with common goals. Furthermore, instructional adaptations for urban youth and Latinos/",14,mtms2013-05-580a,,
"Latinas are discussed with regard to culturally relevant pedagogy, mathematics communities, and formative assessments. ",15,mtms2013-05-580a,,
One clear strength of this book is that it focuses on building and fostering K−grade 12 and university professional learning communities where mathematics educators are considered change agents. The text also discusses how collaboration begins with new teacher development and explores the supportive role of professional learning communities during the induction process. ,16,mtms2013-05-580a,,
"Overall, this book provides  research-based solutions to the evermounting responsibilities of current educators by way of professional learning communities. Each chapter includes an extensive list of resources to help educators develop professional learning communities in their buildings, communities, or districts.  —Lisa Wilkes",17,mtms2013-05-580a,,

"NCTM’s Reasoning and SenseMaking Activities for High School Mathematics: Selections from Mathematics Teacher consists of a  variety of activities organized into five content areas: number and measurement, algebraic symbols, statistics and probability, functions, and geometry. Most if not all of these forty-three activities could be used in some form in middle school classrooms. Many of these activities directly support  middle-school-level Common Core State Standards for Mathematics; others might capture the interest of a math club or be used as independent projects.",22,mtms2013-05-580a,,
"In addition to the content, there  is also a wide variety of technological approaches offered, from cutting out card stock manipulatives to the use of calculators, spreadsheets, and software such as The Geometer’s Sketchpad®. Each chapter begins by concisely stating each activity’s topic, context, and materials needed. An appendix references the Common Core topic clusters corresponding to each activity. Consistent with the book’s title, however, most of the correspondences are with high school clusters.",23,mtms2013-05-580a,,

"This volume is thought-provoking and invites a discussion on the very  nature of mathematics. Although the contributors have engaged in the teaching of mathematics for social justice at different levels and with various  agendas, there is a common theme that suggests mathematics is a compilation of human endeavors that empowers learners in their research and stories. In this context, mathematics is viewed as an unfinished product, a continually growing field of human contributions that is value-laden. ",31,mtms2013-05-580a,,
"The editors have compiled an impressive collection of work that draws attention to the unequal representation and participation in mathematics by certain groups such as women and minorities, the alienation from mathematics experienced by many students, and the role mathematics plays in the distribution of wealth and power (often seen as a filter or gatekeeper)— all of which are issues relevant to the study of mathematics.

"Can your math skills save your life? This book explores how students can survive painful bites from deadly spiders, outrun zombies through Incan ruins, and survive being buried alive in an ancient Egyptian tomb, all with the use of the math skills learned in grades 5-7. ",40,mtms2013-05-580a,,
"Each of the twenty-four challenges  includes a story that provides the background for the problem, advice from Euclid to explain the math and help the student get started, blank work space, and the step-by-step solution. Perhaps the greatest benefit of this book is the Math Lab section that follows each challenge, giving students a hands-on experiment using ordinary household materials so they can explore the mathematical concepts on their own.",41,mtms2013-05-580a,,
"I left this book sitting in a sixthgrade classroom, and the vivid cover immediately drew the attention of a group of boys. They flipped through the book and began to read the first problem aloud. They laughed at the knife on a pendulum scenario but were disappointed when they turned to the back of the book and did not find a solution. They discussed the problem, read the sidebar containing Euclid’s advice, and solved it together. Only then did they turn the page to find a detailed explanation of the answer, thereby boosting their confidence. They had solved the problem differently but found the correct answer.",42,mtms2013-05-580a,,
"This awesome resource has a  couple of minor drawbacks, such as including blank activity sheet pages after each challenge for students to write their responses, thereby ruining the experience for the next student. Also, there is a note on the cover stating that the problems are aligned with the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics, but there is no correlation or listing of standards to make the connections. However, these are relatively small quibbles about a great book that could find a place in every middle school classroom and library.",43,mtms2013-05-580a,,

"This book, for grades 6−8, contains four different logic-path puzzles and step-by-step instructions. In a path puzzle, the solver uses specific rules to create a path. Although the puzzles can be solved using deductive reasoning, Wanko points to research that suggests that spatial-reasoning skills will aid the solver in these challenges and will increase this type of spatial sense (p. 2). ",48,mtms2013-05-580a,,
"Wanko provides clear explanations  of the rules, including step-by-step examples, as well as blank grids and directions to create your own puzzles. Three of the puzzles use numbers to guide placement of lines. The fourth uses black-and-white circles, which may be beneficial for students who get anxious when given “math puzzles.” Providing blank masters so students can create their own puzzles takes the activity to a deeper level.",49,mtms2013-05-580a,,
"I would recommend this book for any educator who works with grade 4 students and above. The puzzles could be used for enrichment and smallgroup activities. They can challenge students at all levels, build spatial reasoning, and provide space for discussion and justification of their solutions. In my seventh-grade class, the students who already had strong  spatial or logical reasoning skills enjoyed the puzzles and said they would try them on their own for fun. Those who struggled reported that they would only do them again if a teacher assigned them.",50,mtms2013-05-580a,,

"This is certainly one of the most exciting books that I have read in mathematics education in some time. It provides a synthesis of findings from research on the content and pedagogy of learning and teaching geometry; thoughtful activities, with detailed descriptions to facilitate classroom conduct; pedagogical considerations while conducting these activities in class; and stimulations to reflect on the interaction for both the teacher and the student. The blend is sure to energize and motivate the reflective educator, teacher, and student of mathematics, in general, and of geometry, in particular. The book content exploits the capabilities of the software, which is consistent with mathematics education principles. Who is the audience? In gen- eral, I would say anyone interested in mathematics education. More specifically, the book is targeted for use by middle school teachers in the classroom. I would certainly consider the book for use in courses with preservice teachers or mathematics education graduate students in a course on learning and teaching geometry. Sections could be used in courses that connect research to teaching and  with issues in mathematics education that relate to geometry, pedagogy, or classroom interaction in mathematics classes.",55,mtms2013-05-580a,,
"Strengths are many, including the  easy-to-understand presentation of comprehensive geometry research; the thoughtfully designed activities and discussions that make it possible for teachers to draw links between pedagogy, content, and research; the use of the software that complements and enhances the value of the activities; and the clear guidelines regarding the expectations from the activities.",56,mtms2013-05-580a,,
"Weaknesses include the idiosyncratic nature of the software artifacts that can lead to misconceptions, the inaccessibility of the software outside the classroom, and the sometimes unclear instructions.",57,mtms2013-05-580a,,
"As a mathematics educator  involved in preservice teacher education, I strongly recommend this book. A middle school teacher, using this product (or parts of it) as a textbook, would ﬁ nd it an exciting challenge as much for himself or herself as for the student.",58,mtms2013-05-580a,,
