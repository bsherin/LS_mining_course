"Edith Cranor-Buck iIn one math class, students no longer  ask, “When am I ever going to use this?” They ask instead,  “How far did your car climb?” “How fast did your car go?” “What gear ratio did you use?” Seventh-grade mathematics students working through a Motorized Toy unit learn when to use what math and why they are using it. While maneuvering through their math course, they are involved in a realworld application that requires using mathematics to solve a problem. This ",1,mtms2011-10-160a,,
"A team teaching activity allowed students to answer these driving questions, “How far did your car climb?” and “What gear ratio did you use?” unit correlates well with the recent emphasis on increasing student interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, or STEM, areas. This article describes a particular activity, the Motorized Toy unit, which supports STEM goals and teaches students the basic concept of ratio. The unit addresses both mathematics and science standards and is part of a team-teaching activity. Powers and DeWaters (2004) report that such projects have been shown  to improve the understanding of basic concepts.  The unit comes from a curriculum titled A World In Motion (AWIM)®, developed over ten years ago. It is problem based, project based, and ties directly into STEM ﬁ elds. The accompanying teacher’s guide  explicitly states that this curriculum allows students to “explore, conjecture, and reason logically, and to gather and manipulate information to arrive at useful knowledge about the world around them” (Education Development Center  1996, p. vii). Students are given a goal or challenge within each unit but must use problem-solving skills to obtain the unit goal. Students must design a toy that meets speciﬁ c performance and judging criteria (see ﬁ g. 1), based on data they collect from a survey given to a group of elementary students. In other words, students must solve a realistic problem  based on the data they have collected from potential consumers.",2,mtms2011-10-160a,,
OVERVIEW OF THE UNIT,3,mtms2011-10-160a,,
"The Motorized Toy unit is intended for seventh-grade students, although it could easily be adapted for eighth grade or a remedial ninth-grade class.  ",4,mtms2011-10-160a,,
"At the start of the eight-week unit,  students are presented with a request for proposal (RFP) that asks for designs and prototypes of a new toy to appeal to children ages 6 to 10. This toy must meet certain design stipulations, be backed by consumer research, and meet the following performance standards:  It must travel at least 3 meters under its own power in under 3 seconds and either climb a 30 degree slope under its own power for at least 1 meter or climb a 15 degree slope under its own power in 2 seconds or less. ",5,mtms2011-10-160a,,
"Students study the detailed RFP and plan, design, and build a motorized toy car (using a kit provided by SAE International) with a body that meets the design speciﬁ cations from a mythical toy company. It must also appeal to consumers (younger elementary students). Students gather information from their consumers and concentrate on two aspects: 1.  Designing the chassis of the toy that will house the gear conﬁ guration, and 2.  Making the gear conﬁ guration  work.",6,mtms2011-10-160a,,
"The main mathematical focus is the chassis design. Will students conﬁ gure the gears of their motorized toy car to (1) make it fast or (2) make it climb? Each option requires that students ﬁ gure out which conﬁ guration of the gears will make the car travel quickly and which conﬁ guration will make it climb. Once they have consumer data and other research, the seventh graders concentrate on making the gear conﬁ guration work. They design, build, test, change, test again, and add the appropriate chassis to the motorized car. The Motorized Toy unit culminates with an assembly during ",7,mtms2011-10-160a,,

PLANNING FOR THE UNIT,22,mtms2011-10-160a,,
"The math teacher plans the unit with her seventh-grade team teachers in science, communication arts, social studies, and art. About two weeks before launching the unit, this team meets to preplan the kick off of this exciting, interdisciplinary unit that will be incorporated into their classrooms. The Teacher’s Guide outlines suggestions on how to plan the unit week by week, including who is responsible for tasks before, during, and after the unit. Since team structure and schedules will vary in each school, ﬂ exibility is a necessary attribute of the process. ",23,mtms2011-10-160a,,
INTRODUCING THE UNIT,24,mtms2011-10-160a,,
"The Motorized Toy unit begins with a team assembly in the auditorium. Students become members of Company Wildside (Wildside is the team name). A CEO is chosen (the math teacher). Vice presidents of scientiﬁ c endeavors (the science teacher), consumer studies (the social studies teacher), communication (the communication arts teacher), and creative endeavors (the art teacher) round out the company. ",25,mtms2011-10-160a,,
MATHEMATICS CLASS,26,mtms2011-10-160a,,

"Calculate the gear ratio of this compound gear train. The driver  gear is marked.  graders are in a life science class, so the teacher chooses instead to discuss bicycle gears in math. Since many students own a bicycle, discussing how it works and their experiences with it is a natural and engaging connection. ",35,mtms2011-10-160a,,
"The teacher brings in a bike, and  the class explores how the gears work. The gear workings are the central mathematical focus in this eight-week math curriculum unit. Students learn that the smaller gear (the driver) rotates the larger gear (the driven gear) to create both movement and the gear ratio. Developing an understanding of  gear ratios, the relationship between the number of rotations of the driver gear and the driven gear, is a concept that students explore and use throughout this unit on gears, force, and motion. The teacher wants all students to understand that a ratio is really a relationship between two parts. ",36,mtms2011-10-160a,,
"To keep gears applied to the topic  of biking, students are asked what they do when they want the bike to go uphill. Do they want the pedaling to be easy or hard? Students are also asked to predict what will happen when gears are changed. A tire is marked, and as it rotates, students compare revolutions of the pedal with revolutions of the tire. They will be investigating this concept of gear ratios while working on their motorized toy.",37,mtms2011-10-160a,,
"Students notice that the number  of times the bike pedal rotates relates to the number of times the tire turns. The equation below  gear ratio rotations of driveii rotations of r geagg r driven gear can be written on the board, showing the gear ratio as a fraction, or as shown in ﬁ gure 2.",38,mtms2011-10-160a,,
"Students work through this  concept, with different participants changing the gears and watching the changes taking place. They work through several gear ratios (see ﬁ g. 3). As the seventh graders’ investigations continue, they begin to understand the proportions and the relationships with the gears. Understanding ratios and applying this knowledge to a bicycle and then their own project allows students to see applications of mathematical concepts. A progression of this development can be seen in the student work in ﬁ gures 3 and 4.",39,mtms2011-10-160a,,
"Figure 3 shows a student progressing in the development of gear ratios between the driver and driven gear. Figure 4a, from a student’s design  log, shows how the learned gear ratio concept is applied to his design. Figure 4b shows how a group applied its knowledge to produce a functioning motorized toy car. ",40,mtms2011-10-160a,,
"Each student produces a design  log. The teacher includes sections in the design logs for a daily journal, new vocabulary, notes on lectures, notes on ideas for the ﬁ nal design, sketches, and sketches with commentary. Throughout the unit, each student writes daily in his or her design log, dating it and brieﬂ y describing what is done that day. A daily inventory of parts from the kits should be taken at the end of class to minimize losses. New vocabulary is added in the vocabulary section. Most critical to the success of each product by the fourstudent design team are the individual sketches and commentary on those sketches. ",41,mtms2011-10-160a,,
"As students learn about gears and gear pairs, gear trains, compound gear trains, and gear ratios, they use those gear ratios on the team chassis. Each student individually sketches his or her gear train and writes what is done and if it is successful or not. If not, why. On every sketch, the gears and the gear ratio are identiﬁ ed. As the motors and wheels are added, students learn to measure and record rim force and speed. As new learning occurs, new sketches are added and described. When it is time to actually design the prototype, students refer to their design log comments and sketches and perhaps incorporate something they had done earlier into the ﬁ nal design. Different students always focus on different pieces of the group project, which strengthens the ﬁ nal version. ",42,mtms2011-10-160a,,
"Design logs are assessed on a  weekly basis. The teacher grades students on inclusion of required parts as well as students’ commentary. Students are also graded on participation in class. Design teams are assigned a gear ratio, which they build and test. ",43,mtms2011-10-160a,,
"After the testing, teams discuss with other teams their results, the required gear ratios, and the challenges they ﬁ nd. Activity sheets on gear ratios, gear pairs, and gear trains are assigned and graded. Most of the grading is individual. Key areas for grade determination are the design log, including sketches and daily work descriptions, and the ﬁ nal presentation, which is required for all students in the teams and calculated as a group grade.

INTEGRATION IN OTHER CLASSES,45,mtms2011-10-160a,,
Science,46,mtms2011-10-160a,,
"Science inquiry is central to this unit. As National Science Education Standards state: “Students . . . should have the opportunity to use scientiﬁ c inquiry . . . including asking questions, planning and conducting investigations, using appropriate tools and techniques to gather data, thinking critically and logically about relationships between evidence and explanations” (National Academy Press 1996, 105). ",47,mtms2011-10-160a,,
"The students are given a RFP  from the ﬁ ctitious toy company and need to establish a plan to meet the speciﬁ cations of the proposal. The same question applies in the other areas: Do they want a toy to be fast or to climb? Students investigate how to get the best product, collect data from their consumers, design their toy, use data to justify their product, and present their information to a panel of judges. Within the science class, the Motorized Toy unit is an example of NCTM’s Process Standards of Connections and Reasoning. ",48,mtms2011-10-160a,,
"As the Teacher’s Guide suggests, the  bike talk can be explained in science, especially physical science. This topic addresses the NSES Standard for grades 5–8 under Motions and Forces, speciﬁ cally, the concept of gear ratio and torque. ",49,mtms2011-10-160a,,
"As students work with gears on  a bicycle, they learn that as the rider changes gears, the rear wheel has more or less twisting force, or torque, to either climb a hill or start from a standstill. To see connections of gear ratio, rim force, and performance, students are required to collect performance data on their motorized toy using a speciﬁ c gear ratio. First, students build gear trains on their vehicle frame to connect the motor to the wheels. Next, they record the gear ratio, measure the speed of the motorized toy over the required three meters, and use a spring scale to measure the force at the rim of the wheel. Students look for relationships among the data they record. These explorations meet science standards as well as the NCTM Content Standard of Data Analysis and Probability (NCTM 2000).",50,mtms2011-10-160a,,
"Since these seventh graders are in a life science class, the science teacher modiﬁ es the unit to ﬁ t her needs. In her class, the students select an animal that they will use as a model for the body of their motorized toy. Once an animal group is chosen, students survey their social studies consumers and decide what animal body to build on the basis of consumer data. Next, they research the animal’s habitat and habits. The culminating science activity asks students to design a pamphlet that illustrates information learned about their animal. ",51,mtms2011-10-160a,,
Communication Arts,52,mtms2011-10-160a,,
"The communication arts class gives guidelines on the writing process, which students apply to their design logs. Students make entries in their log each day that they work on the unit in any of their various classes. Their design logs consist of tabbed sections that include their team’s inventory, new vocabulary, class notes, sketches, and the daily journal in which they describe their work on this project during any class period. Students are ",53,mtms2011-10-160a,,
"Fig. 5 A student-created business card ties the activity to real-life promotion, a business-model necessity.",54,mtms2011-10-160a,,
"required to use technical writing when describing gears and gear ratios and when explaining the decisions they made while building, as would an engineer. Students are also required to communicate problems encountered. Reﬂ ections on teaming, problem solving, discussion, persuasion, and success are all a part of their journaling. Design logs are required and graded weekly. ",55,mtms2011-10-160a,,
Social Studies,56,mtms2011-10-160a,,
"In social studies, students learn about consumer research. To keep results consistent, all design teams use the same survey that they developed in social studies for interviewing classes of elementary students. The survey may include questions such as “What color of animal do you like?” and “Do you prefer the animal to be fast or have the ability to climb?” Once the data are collected, each design team is required to build a chassis-animal based on the desires of their consumers and meet other speciﬁ cations of the RFP. Students compile these data and create charts or graphs illustrating their information. ",57,mtms2011-10-160a,,
Art,58,mtms2011-10-160a,,
"In art class, students build the body to ﬁ t the chassis of their motorized toy car. Design teams keep in mind that the toy must perform to the speciﬁ cations they had prior to placing the animal body on the chassis. Along with  designing and building the chassis, students learn about slogans and logos. Students then create business cards containing their design team logo and slogan (see ﬁ g. 5). Some also produce a thirty-second commercial for their presentation. Finally, students prepare and practice their presentation.",59,mtms2011-10-160a,,
"Parents have commented about their children talking to them about school and what was happening during the Motorized Toy unit, which they found particularly thrilling. One student summed up the unit quite succinctly with his comment, “We have been given a taste of life, and it tastes good!”",60,mtms2011-10-160a,,
CULMINATION OF THE UNIT,61,mtms2011-10-160a,,
"During the grand ﬁ nale of the Motorized Toy unit, design teams present their ﬁ nished project and the research supporting it. The student teams gather in the auditorium with parents, administrators, school board members, the news media, teachers, and other school teams. Each design team pre sents its product, which is then analyzed by a team of judges using the rubric in ﬁ gure 1. After all the presentations are complete, the judges select the top ﬁ ve teams and then announce the winner. Some teams are disappointed. However, as with so many things throughout the unit, this outcome reﬂ ects what happens in the real world. ",62,mtms2011-10-160a,,
CONCLUSION,63,mtms2011-10-160a,,
"The Motorized Toy unit is an excellent, interdisciplinary curriculum that incorporates the math and science standards. Students learn to be problem solvers, work cooperatively, and communicate. In so doing, they increase their content knowledge in all curricular areas. They also gain conﬁ dence in making conjectures and in solving problems. This is especially obvious when they take standardized tests. Data have not been collected to show evidence of improved test scores, but students exhibit a noticeable difference in their attitude and conﬁ dence during test-taking days. ",64,mtms2011-10-160a,,
"Throughout the unit, the students experiment, adjust plans after failures or successes, communicate, reason, and overcome challenges. This learning model is engaging and an adventure for students, parents, and teachers. ",65,mtms2011-10-160a,,
