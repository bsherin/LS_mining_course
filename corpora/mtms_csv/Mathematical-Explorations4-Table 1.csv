2,Mathematical Explorations: Freshwater Scarcity A Proportional Representation,"Middle school students’ mathematical understanding benefits from connecting mathematics to other content areas in the curriculum. NCTM’s Standards for grades 6–8 emphasize “proportionality as an integrative theme in the middle-grades mathematics program” (NCTM 2000,  p. 212). They state that although “facility with proportionality develops through work in many areas of the curriculum, including ratios and proportions, percent, similarity” and so on, “the understanding of proportionality should also emerge through problem solving and reasoning” (NCTM 2000, pp. 212). It is also important, the Standards note, to connect both math and science. To this end, an exploration of Earth’s ",2,Mathematical Explorations: Freshwater Scarcity A Proportional Representation

Such a connection would not only allow students to see that these subjects are interrelated but also prepare them “to use mathematics effectively to deal with quantitative situations in their lives outside of school” (NCTM 2000, pp. 213).

5,Mathematical Explorations: Freshwater Scarcity A Proportional Representation,"In addition, this activity concentrates on the critical areas mentioned in the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSM) that call for greater focus on fewer topics (ratios and proportional relationship for the middle school grades) and coherence (using those mathematical skills to solve real-life word problems). CCSSM’s critical areas for grades 7 and 8 include (1) “developing understanding of and applying proportional relationships”; (2) solving “real-life and mathematical problems using numerical and algebraic expressions and equations”; and (3) solving problems involving the “volume of two- and three-dimensional objects” (CCSSI 2010, pp. 46, 47)—all topics addressed in this Freshwater Scarcity task.

8,Mathematical Explorations: Freshwater Scarcity A Proportional Representation,"Given the composition of the water on our planet, the students replicate the same composition with the water in the dispenser. In the process, they measure the dimensions of the dispenser, consider its “imperfect” shape, estimate its volume, find the error range in their measurements, and calculate the amount of freshwater that is proportional to the freshwater on Earth. This exercise gives students an understanding of the issue of freshwater scarcity that is much deeper and clearer than that obtained by simply reading numbers in their science textbook. That number, usually stated in the millions of gallons, makes little sense to middle schoolers. ",8,Mathematical Explorations: Freshwater Scarcity A Proportional Representation

10,Mathematical Explorations: Freshwater Scarcity A Proportional Representation,"The main objective of this activity is to strengthen and deepen students’ understanding of mathematics by using topics from other disciplines— such as environmental science—as material for problem solving. This approach fosters connections across curricula and allows students to “recognize and apply mathematics in context outside of mathematics” (NCTM 2000, pp. 274). In fact, this exploration was conceived as part of a Mini-Mester program offered by our middle school. Such a program is designed to provide students with a hands-on, interdisciplinary learning experience that focuses on one topic, in our case, “Water: Protecting Our Most Precious Resource.” ",10,Mathematical Explorations: Freshwater Scarcity A Proportional Representation

In the process, students are expected to explain their thinking processes clearly and cogently to others and understand and examine the mathematical reasoning of their peers, which are tenets of NCTM’s Communication Standard for grades 6  –8.

13,Mathematical Explorations: Freshwater Scarcity A Proportional Representation,PROJECT DESIGN,13,Mathematical Explorations: Freshwater Scarcity A Proportional Representation
14,Mathematical Explorations: Freshwater Scarcity A Proportional Representation,"To introduce this exploration, students researched the presence and composition of water on Earth. When viewed from space, our planet appears blue because 70 percent of its surface is covered by water. Therefore, it is reasonable for a student to assume that water is plentiful. However, fresh, potable water is rare; in fact, only  3 percent of Earth’s water is fresh- water and most of it is trapped in glaciers and polar ice caps. As a result, over a billion people do not have access to clean water. If consumption continues unabated, two-thirds of the world’s population may be affected by water shortages by 2025.",14,Mathematical Explorations: Freshwater Scarcity A Proportional Representation
15,Mathematical Explorations: Freshwater Scarcity A Proportional Representation,"The idea that 97 percent of the planet’s water is saltwater and that only 3 percent is freshwater is not easy for students to grasp because the actual volumes are immense and hard to visualize. To have a better understanding of the issue of freshwater scarcity, we set out to express the same proportionality in the water held in a typical office water dispenser. Students were divided in small groups, and each group was issued a water dispenser, a meterstick and rulers, some string, scissors, and activity sheets 1 and 2.",15,Mathematical Explorations: Freshwater Scarcity A Proportional Representation
16,Mathematical Explorations: Freshwater Scarcity A Proportional Representation,CLASS ACTIVITY AND DISCUSSION,16,Mathematical Explorations: Freshwater Scarcity A Proportional Representation
17,Mathematical Explorations: Freshwater Scarcity A Proportional Representation,"Activity sheet 1 explains the process step by step. The students were engrossed in looking for the best way to estimate the volume of the water dispenser, which—as a real-life solid—was not a perfect cylinder. It was fascinating to observe how they discussed various strategies and measuring procedures, monitored and assessed one another’s thinking, understood the problem more deeply,  reflected on their conjectures, and addressed systematically their concerns.",17,Mathematical Explorations: Freshwater Scarcity A Proportional Representation
18,Mathematical Explorations: Freshwater Scarcity A Proportional Representation,"After the students completed   activity sheet 1, the class discussed their answers to questions 1–5 as a group. This conversation already provided a good gauge of the students’ understanding and helped clarify thoughts and ideas. “Experimental,” hands-on approaches, such as the one we used to find the volume of the water container, pose a few challenges and corresponding learning opportunities. For example, many students may think that there is one correct way to  solve any math problem; in our case, students found out immediately that there were several, equally good ways to approximate the volume of a rather irregular shape. Each group needed to adopt a protocol, or procedure, on which all group members agreed. Such a protocol had to be stated lucidly so that all assumptions were clear. Some groups chose to respond to this challenge by discussing various methods to measure the area of the base and the height of the container and by taking into consideration the various “imperfections” of the con-",18,Mathematical Explorations: Freshwater Scarcity A Proportional Representation

They then chose one method and asked each member to proceed with their measurements according to the accepted method. Other groups decided to allow each member to choose his or her own measuring procedure, as long as it seemed reasonable to the other members, and then average the answers.

21,Mathematical Explorations: Freshwater Scarcity A Proportional Representation,"For some comparison of two  groups’ answers to the first and third questions of activity sheet 1, see figures 2 and 3.",21,Mathematical Explorations: Freshwater Scarcity A Proportional Representation
22,Mathematical Explorations: Freshwater Scarcity A Proportional Representation,"Another intellectual hurdle involved  measurement errors. Middle school students, often exposed only to problems with clear-cut, precise numerical answers, do not expect to find errors in a mathematical problem. These complexities led to interesting conversations. For example, because each group found a different answer—a reasonable result, given their different approaches and procedures—the first issue to debate was which answer was best. Even that, however, was open to discussion because students soon recognized that the container could be filled to slightly different levels. To discuss our results, the students decided to take the accepted value of the volume, which for our particular dispenser was 18.9 L, and evaluate how far their estimated value was from that number. To better understand the significance of their approximation, the students calculated the absolute and relative error of their values. (See student work in fig. 4.) We then discussed the possible  sources of errors, which became a rich conversation. Students realized that to take into consideration the local variations of the container shape and to get closer to its actual volume, they needed to add the volumes of eversmaller sections. (See the student work in fig. 5.) This line of thinking provided a simple, yet powerful introduction to the need for calculus and allowed for a much deeper appreciation of real-life problem solving. ",22,Mathematical Explorations: Freshwater Scarcity A Proportional Representation
23,Mathematical Explorations: Freshwater Scarcity A Proportional Representation,"Activity sheet 2 delivers its own  challenges by asking students to calculate the volume of water corresponding to very small percentages (less than 1 percent), which is often difficult to grasp for middle schoolers. To visualize their results, the students poured the minute amounts corresponding to the different types of freshwater into beakers and small cylinders. In our case, to simplify the calculations, we asked the students to round the container volume to 20 L; in this case, freshwater (3 percent of the volume) was represented by  600 mL. An example of students’ work is shown in figure 6. The last column to the right could be used to compare that volume with a real-life example of some sort. For example, in the case of a 20 L container, 411 mL corresponds to a sizeable soda bottle, 180 mL is three-fourths of a singleserve milk carton, and so on.

24,Mathematical Explorations: Freshwater Scarcity A Proportional Representation,EVALUATION AND ASSESSMENT,24,Mathematical Explorations: Freshwater Scarcity A Proportional Representation
25,Mathematical Explorations: Freshwater Scarcity A Proportional Representation,"Although no formal evaluation occurred because the activity was part of a larger school program, students’ work in class was assessed with teacher observations, class discussion, small-group review, and other oral presentations. I kept a tool (a clipboard, a notebook, or an iPad®) with me at all times to take quick notes about each student’s work and contributions. I took those notes into consideration when, at the end of this unit, I wrote a paragraph qualitatively assessing the student’s participation and engagement in the topic. (Those informal assessments were then distributed to the students’ advisors.) Such evaluations can focus on a student’s ability to examine the various facets of a problem, make conjectures, search for strategies and solutions, analyze assumptions and results, pose follow-up questions, and work with others. In addition, a ",25,Mathematical Explorations: Freshwater Scarcity A Proportional Representation

I found this activity to be an extremely useful way to enhance my students’ appreciation of various mathematical concepts. At the same time, it is an activity that answers the question, “When are we ever going to use this?” Several students remarked that this exploration showed them that mathematics is useful, has many real-life applications, and allows a quantitative understanding of the world.
