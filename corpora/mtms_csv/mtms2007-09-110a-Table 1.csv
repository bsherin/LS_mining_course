"Maurer defines an algorithm as being “a precise, systematic method for solving  a class of problems” (1998, p. 21). This article discusses lattice multiplication, which is an algorithm for multiplication, and my preservice students’ conceptual understanding of it. The conceptualization of the algorithm from the multiplication of whole numbers to the multiplication of polynomials is also explored.",3,mtms2007-09-110a,,
"Children could be expected to profit greatly from instruction that emphasized understanding prior to repetitive practice. (Brownell 1986, p. 41)",4,mtms2007-09-110a,,
"The call for instructional practices that emphasize understanding in mathematics has been occurring since at least the time that Brownell originally made the foregoing statement in 1954. The call to improve instructional practices continues with the fervor in research and in practice that has occurred in reaction to and in support of Principles and Standards for School Mathematics (NCTM 2000). This document is “grounded in the belief that all students should learn important mathematical concepts and processes with understanding” (p. ix). Ma extends this need to increase understanding of mathematical procedures and concepts to teachers. She posits that teachers of mathematics need a “profound understanding of fundamental mathematics” (Ma 1999, p. xxiv) to help students truly understand the process and concepts of mathematics. The intent of this article is to help facilitate teacher understanding of the mathematical concepts involved in lattice multiplication and show how this algorithm used for multidigit multiplication can in fact be generalized as a tool to be used in completing polynomial multiplication.",5,mtms2007-09-110a,,

"In my preservice classrooms, lattice multiplication originally was used as a tool to explore alternative algorithms for whole-number multiplication. Like other teachers, I believed that the algorithm was a simple recording tool that had little value beyond being an alternative multiplication algorithm (Broadbent 1987; Carroll and Porter 1998). Carroll and Porter state that the algorithm “ignores place value” and “although the reasons are not obvious, this method has proved to be very popular with students” (1998, p. 111). Broadbent states that “lattice algorithms are easy to teach, and students are fairly successful with them. Unfortunately, they require more time to teach than our standard algorithms” (1987, p. 28). ",7,mtms2007-09-110a,,
"Ignoring the fact that place value is  inherent in the algorithm is how lattice multiplication was first introduced in my classroom. For example, in figure 1, 905 × 41 could be computed by filling in each corresponding product. To place 905 in the grid: The leading digit is placed in the upper-left corner and the rest of the number follows. To place 41 in the grid: The second number is placed in the lower-right corner. The product of 5 × 4 is recorded as 20, and 9 × 4 is recorded as 36. In the case of a single-digit product, a 0 was used in the upper-left corner, and the single-digit product is placed in the lower-right-hand corner. Thus, when multiplying 5 × 1, a 0 is placed in the upper-left-hand corner, and the 5 is placed in the lower-right-hand corner. The order of computing products does not matter. The diagonals are then added, renaming where necessary. (Start in the lower-right corner with 5, then 0 + 0 + 0 = 0, 9 + 2 is 11; the units digit, 1, is recorded and the lead 1, representing 1000, is added to 6 to yield 7. The 3 is brought down.) To read the answer, start at the tenthousands place value in the upper-left side, continuing to read down and around the corner. Then read the numbers from left to right on the bottom. The answer is 37,105. I realized that if we are conceptually looking at what is going on in the algorithm, we could see that 5 × 4 is in fact 5 × 40 and the answer is 200. However, where is the 200 recorded in the representation? The answer leads to the realization that the sum of each diagonal is in fact a place value. See figure 2 to see how the place values are incorporated into the algorithm. Therefore, when we record the 2 representing 2 groups of hundreds from the 20 (product of 5 × 4), we are actually recording 2 groups of hundreds, which is the answer to 5 × 40. Just as when we multiply 900 × 40, we record the product 36,000 as 3 groups of ten thousands and 6 groups of thousands.",8,mtms2007-09-110a,,

"As stated earlier, some believe that lattice multiplication is just an arrangement of numbers and that it has no value in helping students understand the multiplication process. Lattice multiplication, however, can be used to demonstrate the concepts that are needed in the process of multiplication. Being able to see and understand the concepts can then lead students toward computational fluency. Bass states that “understanding algorithms is central to developing computational fluency” (Bass 2003, p. 327). Therefore, understanding just the procedure in the algorithm is not enough; we need to give our students the opportunity to understand what is conceptually going on in the algorithm.  3n0 3n0 1n1 1n1 1n2 1n2 3n1 3n1 5n1 5n1",27,mtms2007-09-110a,,
"The main two components of a  multiplication algorithm are (1) multiplication of each part (addends) of  the two factors and (2) the addition of those products. In any multiplication algorithm, one should be able to pick out these two parts of the multiplication process. The first step in the latticemultiplication algorithm is the creation of the rows and columns, which are constructed based on the partitioning of each factor into addends that are determined by place values. For example, in figure 2 the factors of 905 and 41 are represented as follows: The top row represents 9 groups of hundreds, 0 groups of tens, and 5 groups of ones; the last column represents 4 groups of tens and 1 group of ones. Note that each place value needs to be represented by a digit. In the case of 905, there are 0 sets of tens. However, in setting up the lattice, a 0 needs to be entered in the tens column. The second step is to compute the products by taking each digit in one factor and multiplying it by each digit in the other factor. As shown in figure 2, the products are automatically in the correct place values. The next step is then to add the like terms. In other words, combine the units of tens, hundreds, thousands, and ten thousands. You may need to rename in this process. For example, in figure 2 in the hundreds diagonal we are combining 2 groups of hundreds and 9 groups of hundreds along with two zeroes, indicating no hundreds. So 9 + 0 + 0 + 2 yields 11 groups of hundreds, or 1100. We think of 1100 as 1 group of thousands and 1 group of hundreds. Thus, the 1 in the hundreds place is recorded below the grid in the hundreds column and the 1 group of thousands is added with the 6 groups of thousands to give a total of 7 groups of thousands.",28,mtms2007-09-110a,,
"Therefore, when talking about lattice  multiplication, it is essential to discuss and understand the place values and the products being computed. The conceptual understanding of the multiplication algorithm is encouraged in the preservice classroom in that students are asked to discuss how each factor can be  broken down into addends. In the case of whole-number multiplication, those parts are determined by place values. For example, the number 905 is represented by the addends of 900 + 00 + 5, and 41 is represented by the addends of 40 + 1. Using the distributive property, each addend of one factor is multiplied by each addend of the second factor. The resulting partial products are then summed. ",29,mtms2007-09-110a,,
"In the preservice classroom, the  lattice-multiplication algorithm is then compared with other alternative multiplication algorithms, such as the partial-  products algorithm. This algorithm also shows each product of the various addends of the factors involved in the multiplication. See, for example, figure 3 where 905 × 41 is again computed. As in lattice multiplication, it is easy to see where the distributive property is used to multiply each addend of 41 (namely, 40 and 1) by each of the addends of 905 (namely, 900, 00, and 5). After each product is computed, the sum of the partial products is then found. Thus, preservice students are encouraged to investigate and make connections between the representations of the different steps of the multiplication process.",30,mtms2007-09-110a,,

"During class discussions, the students are encouraged to see how the lattice-multiplication algorithm can be extended to apply to multiplying polynomials. Building the conceptual understanding of what is occurring in multidigit multiplication is essential to the conceptual understanding of what occurs in polynomial multiplication. The ability to understand the concept of breaking down a factor into addends and then multiplying each addend of one factor by each addend of another factor is the foundation for understanding the multiplication of polynomials. When multiplying whole numbers, these addends comprise the values repre-",32,mtms2007-09-110a,,

In the multiplication of polynomials, these addends are the monomials that comprise the polynomial. ",33,mtms2007-09-110a,,
"The traditional FOIL method  for multiplying binomials is a procedure that is often taught with little or no conceptual understanding of the multiplication process. In this method of multiplying binomials, students are taught to multiply according to the acronym: the F (first, meaning the first monomial in each of the polynomials), the O (outer, the first monomial of the first polynomial with the last monomial of the second polynomial), the I (inner, the second monomial of the first polynomial with the first monomial of the second polynomial), and the L (last, the second monomial in each of the polynomials). Therefore, students learn that the letters F, O, I, and L stand for multiplying positions. This method does not in itself address the concept of using the distributive property to multiply each monomial of one polynomial by each of the monomials of the second polynomial. However, if we use lattice multiplication to connect the multiplication of polynomials with that of multiplication of whole numbers, we can see the connection of using the distributive property to multiply the parts of each factor.

"We can take the simple multiplication of two binomials, (n + 2)(n + 3), and set up a lattice similar to the one we use to multiply whole numbers (see fig. 4). It is necessary to connect the process of creating the rows and columns of the multiplication of polynomials to the process of creating the rows and columns of the multiplication of whole numbers. With whole numbers, we use the addends of our factors as determined by place value. When multiplying polynomials, we want to partition our factors into monomials based on the degree of the variable. For example, in our first factor of n + 2, we will partition our factor into one group of n1 and two groups of n0. Likewise, the second factor, n + 3, will be partitioned into one group of n1 and three groups of n0. We can then use these monomials to set up our lattice. Similar to the multiplication-lattice method, multiply each one of the monomials from one polynomial by each of the monomials of the other polynomial. The diagonals in polynomial lattice multiplication are a little different in that the diagonals are composed of diagonal cells. These diagonal cells have like terms, so the addition of the diagonal cells represents the combining of like terms. ",42,mtms2007-09-110a,,
"This strategy can be used for any degree of polynomial. However, one needs to remember that each degree of the variable needs to be represented ",43,mtms2007-09-110a,,

For example, just as zero groups of ten is represented in 905, it is necessary to represent the polynomial n2 + 2 as 1n2 + 0n1 + 2. In this manner, all degrees of the variable for each polynomial are represented. We can illustrate by multiplying (3n2 – n + 3) by (n2 + 2). The lattice multiplication that you would use can be seen in figure 5. The nine products that are computed by multiplying each of the three monomials in the first factor by each of the three monomials in the second factor are shown. By combining like terms (adding on the diagonal), the answer to this multiplication is  3n4 – n3 + 9n2 – 2n1 + 6.",44,mtms2007-09-110a,,
"It is crucial that preservice teachers be able to describe how the steps connect when multiplying whole numbers using various algorithms. It is advantageous if they can also explain how the steps of multiplying whole numbers connect to the steps of multiplying polynomials. If they can understand this connection, they can then see how important it is to be able to conceptualize operations on whole numbers, as this conceptualization of operations extends to algebraic operations. In fact, Carpenter, Franke, and Levi claim that  3n2 1n2 “algebraic reasoning is not a separate –1n1 topic; it is integrally bound with learning arithmetic” (2003, p. 40). Middle –1n3 school mathematics teachers need to conceptually understand why the algorithms they teach work and how the 0n2 arithmetic procedures can be extended to algebraic procedures.",45,mtms2007-09-110a,,
