Look no further than Plinko®, a popular game played on the television show The Price Is Right®. The game of Plinko offers students an exciting real-world example of the applications of probability and data analysis. The Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSI 2010) and the Guidelines for Assessment in Statistics Education (GAISE) (Franklin et al. 2007) suggest that students in grades 6–8 be given ample opportunities to engage in activities and simulations to make predictions and to gather experimental data to test and validate their predictions. Plinko-based mathematical explorations allow students to use technology to generate simulations and employ the data to make informed predictions and inferences.  exploring the probabilities associated with each winning amount (Biesterfeld 2001). A contestant chooses from one of nine starting slots at the top of the Plinko board and drops a coin. The coin hits a certain peg in each row, travels through eleven rows, and lands in one of the nine bins at the bottom of the board. ",5,Dropping In on the Math of Plinko

19,Dropping In on the Math of Plinko,"The lesson was taught to a group of seventh-grade students over two class periods, lasting a total of ninety minutes, in a computer-equipped classroom so students could play an online version. First, we introduced students to Plinko by showing YouTube™ videos. Next, we encouraged students to play an online version of the game (see the sidebar at left to find resource information). To help students better understand the nuances of the game, we posed several questions:  •	 How	do	the	coins	fall? •	 What	happens	when	a	coin	hits	a	 middle peg or a corner peg? •	 What	is	the	probability	of	a	coin	 falling to the left or to the right when it hits a middle peg? •	 How	does	this	probability	change	 when a coin hits a corner peg?

21,Dropping In on the Math of Plinko,"To gain insight into students’ prior understandings and their perceptions of the game, we asked students this assessment question:   If you were given only 1 coin to play on the small Plinko board, which slot would you drop the coin in?

This process enabled us to ascertain if students had understood how to gather and record experimental   data. (See one student’s data in fig. 4.)	Within	each	group,	students	 then combined their individual data to form group data to determine the experimental probability (for a random starting slot) specific to their group (see fig. 5). As students shared their experimental data, they noticed some discrepancies in their findings. Although most groups had performed 30 trials, not all of them had found  similar results (see fig. 6).

55,Dropping In on the Math of Plinko,"To assess understanding of the game and related probability concepts, we asked students to revisit the initial question of which slot is the best in which to drop the coin. Students sifted through their experimental data and noted that more coins landed in slot B′ ($5000) compared with the other two slots. Students claimed that this could be the case because more coins were dropped from slot B. This generated a discussion about how the coins fell along each path.",55,Dropping In on the Math of Plinko
56,Dropping In on the Math of Plinko,"To encourage further discussion  and help students determine the number of paths from each starting  slot (to the ending slots), we provided three	blank	Plinko	charts.	Within	 their groups, students traced the paths starting from slots A, B, and C. Some students used color pencils to differentiate paths that originated from different starting slots. However, the process of determining the number of paths soon became problematic. Some students were either unable to trace all paths or unable to keep track of the number of paths. At this juncture, we brought the class together and invited groups to share their work. Their supporting evidence included verbal arguments and the work from their Plinko chart:  •	 “Can’t	go	left	in	A;	you	also	can’t	 go right in C. This is because you would hit the wall on both sides.” •	 “From	A	to	C′ and from C to A′ there is only one path. It is like a diagonal.” •	 “From	B	there	are	at	least	3	paths	 to the bottom slots.”",56,Dropping In on the Math of Plinko

After these investigations, many students revised their initial response to the assessment question. Before the Plinko lesson enactment, many students had chosen A and C  as their preferred slots. In the post- lesson enactment, a majority of students preferred slot B.
