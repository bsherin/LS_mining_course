0,The Brick Wall Graphic Organizer - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Given the unknown depth of conceptual understanding of content that students have attained during previous years and the increased emphasis on raising standardized assessment scores, engaging students in meaningful mathematical learning experiences can be challenging. One problem is that the magnitude of content to be taught often appears as overwhelming to teachers as it is to their students. Teachers are left to ponder the answers to the following:",,
1,The Brick Wall Graphic Organizer - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,• How can I ensure that a student has mastered the underlying skills and concepts?,,
2,The Brick Wall Graphic Organizer - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,• How do skills and concepts fit together as the content increases in rigor and scope?,,
3,The Brick Wall Graphic Organizer - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,• Is there a way to organize all the information into something that is clear and cohesive to both teachers and students?,,
4,The Brick Wall Graphic Organizer - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,• What would be the best way to have students engage with the content?,,
5,The Brick Wall Graphic Organizer - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,• How can I really know when students have mastered concepts?,,
6,The Brick Wall Graphic Organizer - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"One means of looking at content is to create a “Brick Wall” graphic organizer, a variation of a concept map, which can be adapted for a particular unit or topic of study or used to create a scope and sequence of content. A Brick Wall graphic organizer allows the teacher to address several of the Mathematics Teaching Practices outlined in Principles to Action: Ensuring Mathematical Success for All (NCTM 2014).",,
7,The Brick Wall Graphic Organizer - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,AN APT METAPHOR,,
8,The Brick Wall Graphic Organizer - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"A brick wall provides a fitting description of what happens when teachers try to teach a concept for which students are unprepared. When students are unsuccessful academically, their foundational knowledge may be missing, incomplete, or incorrect. As a result, students “hit a brick wall,” and their academic progress stops because they do not understand and/or they hold misconceptions about a particular concept. Just as in the construction of a building, if one tries to place additional tiers of bricks (content knowledge) on a weak or incomplete framework, the structure starts to sag and, as additional layers are added, finally collapses. This content knowledge collapse often manifests as student frustration during the lesson, a clear signal to the teacher to reinforce foundational concepts. When students have not obtained the prerequisite skills, they lack the foundational knowledge on which to anchor their conceptual understanding and will find it difficult to abstract, generalize, create, and assess concepts. Thus, the Brick Wall graphic organizer serves to help teachers target foundational, discrete concepts and procedures critical to the understanding of the topic at hand.",,
9,The Brick Wall Graphic Organizer - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,REPRESENTING CONTENT KNOWLEDGE,,
10,The Brick Wall Graphic Organizer - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"A concrete means of visualizing concepts and their relationships to one another, graphic organizers have been used to assist students in learning content material. Graphic organizers illuminate critical elements of content and vocabulary while providing an overview of interrelated skills. Moore and Readence noted that teachers who used graphic organizers in their classroom",,
11,The Brick Wall Graphic Organizer - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"were reported to perceive themselves as better organized, more in control of the learning activity, and more sensitive to the demands of the learning task. (1984, pp. 14–15)",,
12,The Brick Wall Graphic Organizer - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Scope and sequence documents contain a general road map of the curriculum, but a Brick Wall graphic organizer shows how concepts build on each other.",,
13,The Brick Wall Graphic Organizer - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Some content areas, especially science, have used concept maps as a visual means of representing content knowledge. In contrast to graphic organizers, which place foundational knowledge at the bottom, concept maps show relationships or links between concepts and are hierarchical in design. “Big ideas” are placed at the top of the concept map, with more specific information appearing in layers below. As an instructional tool,",,
14,The Brick Wall Graphic Organizer - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"when a teacher develops her/his own concept maps for a domain of study, the teacher gains a clearer understanding of the key concepts to be learned, and the concept map also provides guidance for the learning sequence. (Novak and Cañas 2007, p. 31)",,
15,The Brick Wall Graphic Organizer - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,BUILDING A BRICK WALL,,
16,The Brick Wall Graphic Organizer - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Although time-consuming to create, developing a Brick Wall has significant benefits. The graphic organizer visually depicts content knowledge development and may be presented hierarchically. The bottom row of the Brick Wall typically focuses on foundational knowledge: facts, procedures, and concepts. As more complex material is learned, concepts move upward in cognitive complexity, although each level contains some elements of factual, procedural, and conceptual knowledge. Students learn to apply and analyze concepts and then move on to evaluating and creating, requiring them to advance from concrete to abstract thinking processes.",,
17,The Brick Wall Graphic Organizer - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Uncover Gaps,,
18,The Brick Wall Graphic Organizer - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Before creating a Brick Wall, teachers should examine student data to reveal gaps or misunderstandings in students’ conceptual knowledge. A realistic starting point would be to select one or two problematic objectives for deeper analysis. The Brick Wall serves as a visual tool for planning lessons that address student misconceptions while facilitating the acquisition of deep content knowledge.",,
19,The Brick Wall Graphic Organizer - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Write the Objective,,
20,The Brick Wall Graphic Organizer - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The first step of creating a Brick Wall involves writing the objective or standard above the top level of the graphic organizer. Writing out the entire statement is critical to seeing the big picture. Teachers can become overly focused on small details and ignore the relationships between subobjectives and mastery of the objective. A comprehensive examination of the wording is crucial because the statement provides focus for the learning outcome, the type of thinking required, key vocabulary, possible types of assessments and activities, potential student groupings, and other vital lesson elements. This examination may also point out gaps in the teacher’s content knowledge. Teachers and other instructional personnel may find it helpful to reflect on the following questions:",,
21,The Brick Wall Graphic Organizer - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,• What verbs appear in the standard or objective?,,
22,The Brick Wall Graphic Organizer - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,• What questions can be asked to promote higher-order thinking and facilitate learning?,,
23,The Brick Wall Graphic Organizer - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,• What will the students do to demonstrate mastery?,,
24,The Brick Wall Graphic Organizer - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,• What contexts or scenarios could be used to assess the objective?,,
25,The Brick Wall Graphic Organizer - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,• What prerequisite concepts and skills should students have?,,
26,The Brick Wall Graphic Organizer - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,• What new mathematical content will students learn?,,
27,The Brick Wall Graphic Organizer - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,The previously articulated questions were used to develop a sample Brick Wall graphic organizer for the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSM) content standard 7.G.6 (see fig. 1).,,
28,The Brick Wall Graphic Organizer - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
29,The Brick Wall Graphic Organizer - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Identify Verbs and Plan Questions and Assessments,,
30,The Brick Wall Graphic Organizer - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Verbs signal the type of thinking required of the student to demonstrate mastery. The verb solve in CCSSM 7.G.6 implies that demonstrating mastery involves operational skills and that students will be required to analyze information. In contrast, if students were tasked to “create real-world and mathematical problems,” they would construct problems, implying creative thinking.",,
31,The Brick Wall Graphic Organizer - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In conjunction with examining the verbs, the teacher should consider questions to ask to promote higher-order thinking and facilitate learning. Teachers must deliberately plan questions that encourage students to think. This is also the appropriate time to plan for formative and summative assessments, which strongly relates to the next section.",,
32,The Brick Wall Graphic Organizer - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Determine Mastery Factors,,
33,The Brick Wall Graphic Organizer - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"According to CCSSM 7.G.6, students will “solve real-world and mathematical problems involving area, volume and surface area of two- and three-dimensional objects.” Because both two- and three-dimensional objects are involved, students must be familiar with critical properties of “objects composed of triangles, quadrilaterals, polygons, cubes, and right prisms” before solving the problems. This knowledge will facilitate their analyses and solutions of both problem types. Teachers may need to consult other resources, such as previous assessments or curricular materials, to gain clarity as to the wording of the objective. For example, the word composed in the given example suggests that the listed objects could be combined in some way, such as to form irregular shapes.",,
34,The Brick Wall Graphic Organizer - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Consider Contexts,,
35,The Brick Wall Graphic Organizer - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The standard indicates that teachers should plan a variety of instructional experiences because students will demonstrate mastery through solving “real-world and mathematical problems.” Teachers should note whether the wording has any additional information that could supply a context for the skill. Some of those instructional experiences may be solving textbook types of questions, but students also need to know where and how this skill is used in the real world, thereby offering answers to “big picture” questions, such as “When will I ever use this?” or “Why do I need to know this?” Teachers should consider the contexts and scenarios in which students might use the skill as adults as well as how students might use this skill right now. For example, students may be assigned real-world scenarios to demonstrate mastery.",,
36,The Brick Wall Graphic Organizer - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Ponder Prerequisites versus New Concepts and Skills,,
37,The Brick Wall Graphic Organizer - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"What concepts and skills should students have already acquired? What new mathematical content will students learn? These two questions task the teacher with thinking about knowledge and skills that students should have already mastered as well as identifying what new learning will take place. In some cases, skills may have been learned at a previous grade level, and such knowledge may need to be reactivated.",,
38,The Brick Wall Graphic Organizer - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"CCSSM 7.G.6 contains a great deal of mathematical language: “area, volume and surface area of two- and three-dimensional objects composed of triangles, quadrilaterals, polygons, cubes, and right prisms.” This fragment incorporates several critical mathematical understandings, such as being able to calculate the “area, volume and surface area” of objects as well as knowing essential attributes of various two- and three-dimensional objects. The implication is that students should be immersed in a variety of activities across several days to assemble and master the knowledge and skills needed before they are assessed.",,
39,The Brick Wall Graphic Organizer - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Teachers should also consider which prerequisite skills are likely to thwart students’ success in mastering the standard or objective. To successfully master CCSSM 7.G.6, students must know significant words and phrases that indicate whether the problem or real-life situation involves calculations of area for the two-dimensional “triangles, quadrilaterals, [and] polygons.” To address these concepts, teachers might need to create a Brick Wall that addresses only two-dimensional objects. Other prerequisite skills include the ability to select and use the appropriate formulas or the computational skills required for successfully mastering the objective. For example, students may be uncertain of terms or phrases that signal whether a perimeter or area formula should be used. Problems might use measurements that involve calculations with decimals or fractions. Additionally, some formulas, such as the area of a square (A = s2), incorporate notation, indicating that students need an understanding of exponents.",,
40,The Brick Wall Graphic Organizer - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,EXAMINING THE BRICK WALL EXAMPLE,,
41,The Brick Wall Graphic Organizer - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Having talked through the development of a Brick Wall, we will now examine figure 1 in depth. The visual builds upward from the foundational knowledge in the bottom row of “bricks.” This level includes essential prerequisite foundational concepts, skills, and basic terminology related to the targeted objective. Mastering CCSSM 7.G.6 requires prior knowledge of attributes and terminology associated with two-dimensional and three-dimensional figures, that an object’s orientation does not change its characteristics, and the ability to solve problems involving perimeter and area formulas.",,
42,The Brick Wall Graphic Organizer - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The next level shows that students must acquire advanced understanding of the terminology and attributes for various geometric figures, as these provide the foundational information needed for solving problems that are more complex.",,
43,The Brick Wall Graphic Organizer - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The highest level reveals the content knowledge that students are expected to master, along with the skills of manipulation and application they are expected to hone to solve real-world problems by creating and evaluating solutions.",,
44,The Brick Wall Graphic Organizer - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,PLANNING FOR STUDENT SUCCESS,,
45,The Brick Wall Graphic Organizer - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"After thoughtfully considering the previous questions, the teacher should select or design culminating activities but also incorporate opportunities to fill in the missing “bricks,” or underlying conceptual understandings. McTighe and Wiggins (2004) suggest that educators “plan with the ‘end in mind’ by first clarifying the learning you seek; that is, the desired learning results” (p. 25). The following paragraphs outline a multifaceted activity that would incorporate both real-world and mathematical problems to address part of the CCSSM 7.G.6 standard.",,
46,The Brick Wall Graphic Organizer - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Various sizes of boxes (cereal, cracker, granola bar, or other products) will help guide students’ investigation of the standard. Students’ abilities to mentally visualize and manipulate figures improve when they work with physical models. The unique characteristics of those products offer opportunities for further real-world explorations related to shipping, marketing, and displaying products.",,
47,The Brick Wall Graphic Organizer - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Since calculations of surface area and volume are important in demonstrating mastery of CCSSM 7.G.6, the teacher needs to formally or informally ascertain each student’s understanding of vocabulary, such as the length, width, height (more challenging on triangles), face, and base. The teacher should also determine students’ ability to accurately measure an object using both metric and U.S. customary units and review computational skills with decimals and fraction numbers. Calculators should be available for those with special learning disabilities but are also appropriate for all students to use in checking computations.",,
48,The Brick Wall Graphic Organizer - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The teacher should guide students in critically examining the boxes by posing questions (and follow-up questions), such as these:",,
49,The Brick Wall Graphic Organizer - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,• What is the mathematical name of these three-dimensional objects?,,
50,The Brick Wall Graphic Organizer - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,• Why would these items be called rectangular prisms?,,
51,The Brick Wall Graphic Organizer - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,• What are the differences (similarities) between a rectangle and rectangular prism?,,
52,The Brick Wall Graphic Organizer - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"To establish whether students have basic foundational knowledge of object attributes, the teacher could pose similar questions for squares and cubes, triangles and triangular prisms, and other two- and three-dimensional objects.",,
53,The Brick Wall Graphic Organizer - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Posing scenarios will guide students to deep understanding of the standard:,,
54,The Brick Wall Graphic Organizer - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"• If you were to select one of these rectangular prisms to use as a container for a present and wanted to wrap it as a gift, which one would have the greatest (or least) volume (surface area)?",,
55,The Brick Wall Graphic Organizer - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,• What would you do if you were asked to order a set of rectangular prisms by volume (surface area)?,,
56,The Brick Wall Graphic Organizer - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,• Would a rectangular prism with the greatest (or least) height always have the largest (or smallest) volume (or surface area)? Why or why not?,,
57,The Brick Wall Graphic Organizer - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Having the ability to measure the dimensions of objects offers students opportunities to confirm or refute their predictions of the volume or surface area, further developing their reasoning skills.",,
58,The Brick Wall Graphic Organizer - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"With regard to surface area explorations, students should be given a chance to physically dismantle boxes to see the net of the three-dimensional shape. Outlining and color-coding the opposing faces would help students understand why they should not calculate the “flaps” of the net for the surface area. Students often have misconceptions concerning how the orientation of an object affects its characteristics, so the teacher may want to have students draw nets of the same object, with different faces as the base, and complete the formulas’ computations.",,
59,The Brick Wall Graphic Organizer - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"With the prior explorations successfully completed, a final summative assessment of CCSSM 7.G.6 might be for students to design a different three-dimensional object with the same volume or surface area as your original object, or to double (half, triple, and so on) the dimensions of your original object and recalculate the surface area and volume. This summative assessment also works well as a group activity if roles are specified and everyone is required to independently turn in all computations as well as a summary of the steps in completing the assessment. Sufficient time will be needed for completion of drawings and computations because students are actually working backward through the formulas. With careful thought, the teacher can differentiate the assessment to address student abilities.",,
60,The Brick Wall Graphic Organizer - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,SPECIAL POPULATIONS,,
61,The Brick Wall Graphic Organizer - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The Brick Wall can serve as a planning tool for Response to Intervention (RtI) activities or other strategies to meet the diverse needs of learners. RtI is a hierarchical system of interventions with three tiers: Universal, Targeted, and Intensive (Howell, Patton, and Deiotte 2008, p. xiii). The Brick Wall presents an overall picture of concept and skills within a particular unit or time frame, quickly communicating key vocabulary as well as specific skills, formulas, and levels of thinking required of students. The co-creation and sharing of the visual with English language learner or special education teachers and aides could guide the development of Individualized Education Plans. The teacher and other instructional personnel could make copies of the Brick Wall and use it as a documentation tool by notating students’ names on specific bricks representing a discrete skill or concept that either has or has not yet been mastered.",,
62,The Brick Wall Graphic Organizer - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,FINAL THOUGHTS,,
63,The Brick Wall Graphic Organizer - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"A Brick Wall graphic organizer requires no magic number of bricks per row or set number of levels to use when constructing. However, it offers great flexibility as to how to start mapping out content knowledge. Some teachers may begin with vocabulary or computational skills; others, with thinking skills. Some may start with the summative assessment and work backward through the levels. The physical size of the Brick Wall is also flexible. Larger visuals, such as using a regular sheet of typing paper for each brick, could be posted in a teacher work area, used to map out curriculum, or displayed in the classroom to serve as a more sophisticated version of a word wall. Smaller 8 1/2 inch by 11 inch versions could easily fit into notebooks or file folders.",,
64,The Brick Wall Graphic Organizer - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In conclusion, the Brick Wall graphic organizer can help teachers articulate “mathematics goals to focus learning,” develop and “implement tasks that promote reasoning and problem solving,” and “use and connect mathematical representations” (NCTM 2014, p. 10). The tool can serve as a guide for teachers as to how “to adjust instruction continually in ways that support and extend learning” and plan for “meaningful mathematical discourse” through the development and posing of “purposeful questions” (NCTM 2014, p. 10). Finally, the graphic organizer can provide both teachers and students with “evidence of student thinking to assess progress toward mathematical understanding,” as they “build procedural fluency from conceptual understanding” and “grapple with mathematical ideas and relationships” (NCTM 2014, p. 10).",,
