Ask your students to analyze geometric           representations of arithmetic sequences  for a meaningful problem-solving experience.,2,mtms2011-08-34a,,
"mmMost future teachers are familiar with  number patterns that represent an arithmetic sequence, and most are able to determine the general representation of the nth number in the pattern. However, when they are given a visual representation instead of the numbers in the pattern, it is not always easy for them to make the connection between the visual and symbolic representation of the pattern. By exploring a variety of number patterns in a visual context, students gain a deeper understanding  of arithmetic sequences by learning how to relate the illustration to the general symbolic representation of these patterns.",3,mtms2011-08-34a,,
"Providing opportunities for students that promote problem solving, reasoning, communication, connections, and designing and analyzing representations is a theme that is present throughout the Curriculum Focal Points for Prekindergarten through Grade 8 Mathematics (NCTM 2006). However, being able to bring together  these ideas into one lesson can be challenging. One activity that was completed with preservice elementary school and middle school teachers in a methods course combined these ideas. The purpose of the activity was to help preservice teachers understand how the symbolic form of an arithmetic sequence can be formed from its geometric representation.  algeBraic and geoMetric connection (Throughout the article, preservice teachers will be referred to as students.)",4,mtms2011-08-34a,,
"The students in my methods course have a wide range of math knowledge. Some select mathematics as their area of concentration, but most take only the two mathematics courses required of all elementary education majors. Therefore, it was not surprising that some were unfamiliar with the general algebraic representation of the nth term of an arithmetic sequence, which is symbolically represented as  an = a1 + (n – 1)d for              n = 1, 2, 3, . . . , where a1 is the fi rst term of the sequence and d is the common difference between consecutive terms. This formula can be used to determine the nth term of an arithmetic sequence, given the fi rst several terms of the sequence. For instance, in the arithmetic sequence 1, 4, 7, 10, . . . , the fi rst term is 1 and the common difference between consecutive terms is 3. Using these values in the algebraic formula to write the nth term of the arithmetic sequence gives an = 1 + (n – 1)(3)                 = 1 + 3n - 3                 = 3n – 2 for             n = 1, 2, 3, . . . . ",5,mtms2011-08-34a,,
"In developing an activity involving arithmetic sequences, I did not want the students to simply “plug and chug” into the formula, which is what most had remembered about arithmetic sequences. Instead, I wanted them to look at this formula from a geometric standpoint. By rewriting the righthand side of the formula, the nth term of the sequence can be represented in an alternate form as  an = dn + (a1 – d )  for              n = 1, 2, 3, . . . . ",6,mtms2011-08-34a,,
"Geometrically, this indicates that the nth term (an) has d groups of size n, and a1 – d additional units. For instance, in the arithmetic sequence 3, 5, 7, 9, . . . , the common difference between the terms is two, which defi nes the number of repeated groups in each term. The term number tells us the size of those groups. Additional units may be added to each term. For this example, we can rewrite the terms as shown in table 1. It should be noted that if the common difference, d, is larger than the initial term, a1, then we are subtracting units. ",7,mtms2011-08-34a,,
"The problems shown in fi gures 1 and 2 were assigned to help students understand how to apply a geometric representation to a sequence of fi gures. In fi gure 1a, students could easily see that the fi rst term is 1 and that the common difference between consecutive terms is 4. The goal,  though, was to help students understand the geometric representation of an arithmetic sequence and how it helps to form the symbolic representation. Knowing that the common difference is 4 means that we should look for four groups in each fi gure. In the fi rst fi gure, we expect to  have four groups of 1; in the second fi gure, we should have four groups of 2; in the third fi gure, we should have four groups of 3, and so on. Geometrically, each term of the sequence has 4 groups of size n and –3 additional units. Figure 1b shows one way to think about this pattern from a geometric standpoint. For example, in the third fi gure, there are four groups of size 3 (because n = 3) and –3 additional units. The –3 additional units indicates that center squares were counted three additional times, so we must subtract 3 to offset the repeated counting. The information obtained from the geometric representation can then be used to determine the symbolic representation of the number of squares in the nth fi gure of the pattern. The symbolic form is an = 4n – 3.",8,mtms2011-08-34a,,
"Figure 2a shows that the common difference between the two fi gures is 3. Figure 2b illustrates one way of identifying the groups of 3 in each fi gure. We are looking for three groups of 4 (because n = 4) in the fi gure on the left and three groups of 5 (because n = 5) in the fi gure on the right. In each case, the one dot in the center is not included in any  table 1 The arithmetic sequence 3, 5, 7, 9, . . . is expressed in terms of n, the term number.  expression 3 = 2(1) + 1 5 = 2(2) + 1 7 = 2(3) + 1 9 = 2(4) + 1 description",9,mtms2011-08-34a,,

After working through the series in fi gures 1 and 2, students began to get a good sense of how to use the geometric representation to write a symbolic form of an arithmetic sequence.  other connections",23,mtms2011-08-34a,,
"To ensure that students understood enough to write the symbolic form from the geometric representation, they were given a single fi gure in a pattern from an arithmetic sequence. They were then asked whether it was possible to determine the number of dots in the nth fi gure (see the question in fi g. 3). Most students realized that not enough information was given. ",24,mtms2011-08-34a,,
"Some indicated that we needed to know the term number to which the fi gure corresponded. After students were told that n = 3 for the given fi gure, they realized that we also needed information about the common difference or another term. At this point, they began to see the connection between the alternate symbolic representation of the arithmetic sequence, ",25,mtms2011-08-34a,,

"To follow up on the activity, students were asked to write an explanation of the solution that their group created and reﬂ ect on what they had learned. They responded to three questions. Their comments have been added after each.  1. How did the problem deepen your understanding of  mathematics?",29,mtms2011-08-34a,,
"After working on this problem and seeing other groups’ problems, my understanding has grown, and I feel more confi dent in my ability to represent sequences. If I had not had the opportunity to use manipulatives to represent a sequence, I think my understanding of sequences would have remained poor and undeveloped.",30,mtms2011-08-34a,,
"What I learned about mathematics is that there is so much that can be done with just one idea. We could have spent time solving equations, but we focused on trying to understand what was really going on in the equation. There is always a way to go deeper in math.",31,mtms2011-08-34a,,
"I could solve algebra problems for a term or reduce them into a less complicated formation, but I didn’t know that I could use the terms to create my own shape. I didn’t know that the difference equaled the number of groups or the number equaled the number in the group. I just knew them as d and n. Now I have a better understanding of how to formulate a shape when given one or two numbers.",32,mtms2011-08-34a,,
2. What did you learn about mathematical problem solving?,33,mtms2011-08-34a,,
"Discussing and seeing that we all came up with different designs from similar problems goes to show what a wide range we will be working with in our classrooms. There is no one way to go about a problem. Some of us were able to develop the equation without the photos or illustrations, and some of us were unable to put the two together.",34,mtms2011-08-34a,,
"One of the main things that I learned about mathematical problem solving from this problem is the need for students to work together. In the beginning of my group working on this, each of the group members was working on a separate component of the problem and not communicating with the rest of the group.",35,mtms2011-08-34a,,
3. What did you learn about teaching mathematics? ,36,mtms2011-08-34a,,
"Well, the most important thing I learned was not so much about this problem in particular but the importance of creating higher-order thinking in mathematics. We used each level of the [Bloom’s] taxonomy. We used knowledge by just being introduced to sequencing. We then used comprehension by discussing it and explaining sequencing. The next level, application, was used by actually solving the problems. We used the formula, which we learned in the previous stages to solve the problems. We also experimented with the equation by reducing it to more simplistic terms and solving other problems with the new equation. This also fell into the synthesizing level of Bloom’s taxonomy. Finally, we used evaluation by tying it to the manipulatives. We used the manipulatives to prove the equation by attaching it to concrete objects.",37,mtms2011-08-34a,,
"I learned that rather than teaching students to memorize formulas, we should equip them with the necessary tools to arrive at a solution on their own.",38,mtms2011-08-34a,,
"  From this problem, I learned that teaching mathematics should be done in a way that gives students a basic,  concrete understanding of math and then allows them to build off that understanding.",39,mtms2011-08-34a,,
"an = dn + (a1 – d ),  and the equation of a line in slopeintercept form,  y = mx + b. ",40,mtms2011-08-34a,,
"To write the equation of the line when given a point on the line, we must know either the slope or another point. Similarly, to write the symbolic form of the arithmetic sequence when given a particular term, students realized that they needed to know the difference between consecutive terms or any two terms. ",41,mtms2011-08-34a,,
"Further, a connection is found  between the slope (m from the linear equation) and the difference (d from the arithmetic sequence). Just as the slope of a line is constant for a given line, the common difference between consecutive terms in an arithmetic sequence is also constant for a given arithmetic sequence. That is, in the equation of the line, for every unit increase in x, we are changing y by m units. Similarly, in the equation for an arithmetic sequence, for every unit increase in n, we are adding d units to generate the next term of the sequence. ",42,mtms2011-08-34a,,
"In a similar manner, a connection occurs between the values b and a1 – d in the two equations. The value b in the linear equation is generally viewed as the y-intercept, but it can also be considered the vertical shift in the graph of the line. That is, each value of y is shifted b units upward (b > 0) or downward (b < 0) with no shift occurring when b equals 0. And within each term of an arithmetic sequence are a1 – d additional units. Just as with the value b, these a1 – d units may be positive (if a1 > d), negative (if a1 < d), or zero (if a1 = d). ",43,mtms2011-08-34a,,
"By showing students the connections between the equation of a line and the symbolic form of an arithmetic sequence, they were able to better understand the information that was  required to generate the nth term of an arithmetic sequence.",44,mtms2011-08-34a,,
creating their own Patterns,45,mtms2011-08-34a,,
"Once students understood what information was required to form a geometric pattern for an arithmetic sequence, they were given a piece of paper with either a value of n and d or two values of n. The students then worked in groups of two or three. On the basis of information they were provided, they could create their own patterns using chips. At least two figures in their pattern had to be formed, and a symbolic representation of the nth figure had to be determined. ",46,mtms2011-08-34a,,
"If students were given two values  of n, they were able to select their own value for d (except d = 1, since that value presented little challenge). If students were given a value of n and d, they had to either form the nth and n + 1st figures or form the n – 1st and nth figures at a minimum. (See fig. 4.) They were also required to state the symbolic form for the nth figure in their pattern. ",47,mtms2011-08-34a,,
"For example, figure 4a shows the fourth and the fifth figures, given a difference of two between the terms. It is relatively easy to identify two groups of four at left and two groups of five at right. In both cases, two chips have not been counted, so they represent the additional units in the symbolic form. The number of dots, or chips, in the nth figure is 2n + 2. Figure 4b shows the third and fourth figures in a pattern. We find the common difference is 3 after counting the number of chips in each figure. The top figure should have three groups of 3; the bottom figure should have three groups of 4. Since two chips are missing in each group of three or four, we must subtract two units when writing the symbolic form. Thus, the number of chips in the nth figure is 3n – 2. ",48,mtms2011-08-34a,,

Fig. 5 When given terms 3 and 5  students produced these first five terms.  n = 3 n = 5 d = 4,54,mtms2011-08-34a,,
"Sometimes, two nonconsecutive values of n were given to students to make it more challenging to create a pattern. In this case, students generally found it easier to create several figures in the pattern once a value of d was decided on. Figure 5 shows an example of the first several figures in a pattern, given configurations for the third and fifth term. In this case, the  common difference between consecutive terms is 4.",55,mtms2011-08-34a,,
"Although this part of the activity  was difficult for many students, it was instrumental in helping them gain a deeper understanding of arithmetic sequences. It also showed them another method of identifying the nth term of an arithmetic sequence. Class discussion of the patterns created by each group also helped clarify the students’ understanding of the connection between the geometric and algebraic representations of arithmetic sequences.",56,mtms2011-08-34a,,
"the semester, one student noted this in her course reflection comments: ",57,mtms2011-08-34a,,
"While taking the state certification exam, I was asked to do some problem solving that involved some of the skills we covered this term. Not knowing finding the nth term would be on the exam, I didn’t review it. However, with fairly easy recall, I was able to perform the task. I have been taught (or was told) how to solve these types of problems; however, full understanding didn’t come until now.",58,mtms2011-08-34a,,
conclusion,59,mtms2011-08-34a,,
Allowing students the opportunity to apply their knowledge in ways that are different from the norm can help them develop a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts. Later in ,60,mtms2011-08-34a,,
"Having students create their own patterns allowed them to understand the connection between the visual and symbolic representation of an arithmetic sequence.
