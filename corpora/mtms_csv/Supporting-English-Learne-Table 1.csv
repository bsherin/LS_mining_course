Integrating the development of language and mathematics content is important in addressing this problem because it can lead to productive opportunities for ELLs to learn mathematics (August et al. 2005; Brenner 1998; Calderón 2007; Lager 2006; Snow 2007; Snow, Lawrence, and White 2009). However, language work and mathematics work are often separated because of testing demands, resulting in lowered ELL engagement in mathematics lessons (Firestone, Martinez, and Polovsky 2006).

15,Supporting English Learners: Lessons from Research,"The area task in figure 1 is similar to those found in many middle-grades mathematics textbooks. To solve it, some students may try to apply the triangle area formula by incorrectly using side lengths of 2 and 4 units because one side passes through two grid squares and another passes through four grid squares. Others may partition the triangle into pieces or count the grid squares within the triangle. Understanding students’  figures may support students in going beyond an automatic, and perhaps an incorrect, use of area formulas to thinking about other entry points to determine area. In addition, the shapes relate to one another; notice that the first shape is translated, reflected, and rotated to obtain the second shape. The third shape is related to the first two, although two adjoining sides on the right are reflected, creating a concave polygon.

22,Supporting English Learners: Lessons from Research,"The Common Core’s Standards for Mathematical Practice are a critical component for providing access to  CCSSM for all students, including ELLs. Students need many and varied opportunities to think like mathematicians, and they need to do the work of mathematics on a regular basis. The SMP describe some of what the work of mathematics entails. They do not stand on their own as separate concepts; rather, the SMP are intertwined with one another and describe how students can engage with and learn about mathematical content. It is therefore critical to implement lessons and tasks in ways that promote and support ELL engagement in the work of mathematics and the SMP. The area lesson described above provides several examples of integrating support for engagement in the SMP into a lesson. ",22,Supporting English Learners: Lessons from Research

38,Supporting English Learners: Lessons from Research,"We also designed the lesson fl ow to give the teacher opportunities for instructional questions to support all students in engaging in mathematical thinking, as described in the SMP. Several questions in fi gure 4 are intended to prompt students to provide and refi ne explanations of their thinking, thereby supporting students in becoming more precise about their mathematical ideas (not just their explanations of the ideas, but the ideas themselves), in line with SMP 6: attend to precision (CCSSI 2010, p. 7).

39,Supporting English Learners: Lessons from Research,"Some explanations of thinking prompted by pair work and teacher questioning also promote constructing viable arguments and critiquing the reasoning of others (SMP 3; CCSSI 2010, p. 6).

45,Supporting English Learners: Lessons from Research,"With this analogy, Mario tried to make a concrete and accessible case to Luisa about his critique of her approach to fi nding the area of the fi gure. By engaging in SMP 3, Mario also supported Luisa in becoming slightly more precise (SMP 6; CCSSI 2010, p. 7) about her line of reasoning; she was eventually able to articulate that she believed she should only count the “whole boxes.” This additional precision about her idea allowed the students and their teacher to identify what was missing from Luisa’s line of reasoning and to move toward a more thorough understanding of the mathematics.

46,Supporting English Learners: Lessons from Research,"Finally, we considered SMP 5: use appropriate tools strategically (CCSSI 2010, p. 7) when choosing which tools to make available for this lesson. For example, we provided a nonruler straightedge to support students in adding lines to the shapes (e.g., to encase shapes in a rectangle). We made this choice to avoid student use of a ruler to measure side lengths, which might play into students’ inclination to quickly fi nd some way to use, often incorrectly, an area formula rather than considering the geometric structure of the fi gures (SMP 7; CCSSI 2010, p. 7). Colored pencils are another tool to support student thinking for this lesson, for example, by allowing students to indicate with different colors which partial grid squares they combined to create whole grid squares.

55,Supporting English Learners: Lessons from Research,"The FMSELL study’s analytical framework (excerpts are in table 1) includes three instructional principles for supporting ELLs, which are vital for supporting their mathematical learning and language development (Ramirez and Celedón-Pattichis 2012): •  Engage ELLs in challenging  mathematics tasks •  Develop their academic language •  Encourage multiple modes of  communication",55,Supporting English Learners: Lessons from Research
56,Supporting English Learners: Lessons from Research,We used these principles to guide our revisions of the typical area task (see fi g. 1) and incorporate it into a complete area lesson to support ELLs. ,56,Supporting English Learners: Lessons from Research
57,Supporting English Learners: Lessons from Research,Engage ELLs in Challenging Mathematics Tasks,57,Supporting English Learners: Lessons from Research
58,Supporting English Learners: Lessons from Research,"Because ELLs are not typically given the same opportunities to engage with challenging mathematical tasks that non-ELL students are (Abedi and Herman 2010), this principle holds particular importance for teachers of ELLs. These students can and should be provided with challenging mathematics tasks supported by appropriate scaffolding for their language needs. In developing the area lesson, we were careful not to simplify the mathematical content of the lesson, even if we needed to clarify some of the language. The lesson provides students with the opportunity to use a variety  of solution strategies while working on the task; in fact, students are asked to use at least two methods for fi nding the areas of the fi gures.",58,Supporting English Learners: Lessons from Research
59,Supporting English Learners: Lessons from Research,"By working in pairs and then  discussing the task as a whole group, students are presented with their classmates’ strategies in addition to their own, giving them opportunities to justify their methods and solutions. They must also consider the meaning of the alternate methods and solutions. In addition, the questions in fi gure 4 help teachers probe both ELL and nonELL students’ thinking to promote sense making. The level of cognitive demand remains high throughout the lesson to challenge students and push them to extend their thinking beyond area formulas to understanding the meaning of area, even if they are not yet able to communicate fl uently in English about the mathematics.",59,Supporting English Learners: Lessons from Research
60,Supporting English Learners: Lessons from Research,Develop Their Academic Language,60,Supporting English Learners: Lessons from Research
61,Supporting English Learners: Lessons from Research,"Teachers can attend to the second principle for supporting ELLs through the use of a number of instructional strategies, such as revoicing students’ ideas and describing a concept using many different words and phrases (Moschkovich 1999). Introducing new words in context rather than distributing a list, as well as taking advantage of cognates, are ways in which teachers can help ELLs learn relevant vocabulary (August et al. 2005; Snow et al. 2009).",61,Supporting English Learners: Lessons from Research
62,Supporting English Learners: Lessons from Research,"Allowing ELLs to use everyday language, as well as academic language, in mathematical discussions is also important; frequent opportunities for students to communicate about mathematics, whether using formal or informal language, can support the development of their mathematical thinking and their mathematical language (Moschkovich 1999). In our lesson, we added the area review in fi gure 2, which the teacher and students read together and to which students can refer at any point while working on the task, as needed.",62,Supporting English Learners: Lessons from Research
63,Supporting English Learners: Lessons from Research,"By including the area review, ELLs can begin the task with the same reference point as the non ELLs as well as share some important vocabulary. Throughout the lesson, students are encouraged to discuss their thinking about the task with partners as well as record written responses on the activity sheet whose questions can be seen in fi gure 3. The purpose behind having students discuss and record is to allow them to express their ideas, not to test students on their correct language use or spelling. ",63,Supporting English Learners: Lessons from Research
64,Supporting English Learners: Lessons from Research,"Giving students time to work  individually and in pairs, as well as opportunities for whole-group discussions, allows them multiple opportunities throughout the lesson to record and share aloud their mathematical thinking as well as listen to their classmates’ ideas. In these ways, the area lesson  helps ELLs focus on communicating their mathematical thinking. ",64,Supporting English Learners: Lessons from Research

Allowing for the use of multiple modes of communication when representing mathematical ideas provides access to ELLs who might not be comfortable explaining their thinking with words alone (Moschkovich 2002). Teachers can also help students look across multiple representations to fi nd connections among them for a deeper understanding of the mathematics.

The instructor asked Mario to explain his use of “straight boxes” but allowed him to continue to use the term rather than correcting his everyday language. Moving Mario to the correct terminology will come later; the instructor’s purpose in this instance was to have the student express what he noticed. Mario used gestures (tracing and pointing) to help with his explanations. In this example, Mario went beyond just sharing his answers, or even the process for fi nding his answers, to a deeper discussion about how the squares on the grid related to the areas of the shapes.",74,Supporting English Learners: Lessons from Research
