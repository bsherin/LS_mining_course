0,Understanding Linear Functions and their Representations - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Linear functions are an important part of the middle school mathematics curriculum. Students in the middle grades gain fluency by working with linear functions in a variety of representations (NCTM 2001). A card sort activity involving linear functions is an engaging way to synthesize concepts, including recognizing the importance of both the rate of change and vertical intercept in uniquely defining a linear function, interpreting vertical intercepts and rates of change in various contexts, and translating fluently among representations.",,
1,Understanding Linear Functions and their Representations - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The use of a variety of representations allows students to make connections among the different ideas and helps deepen their understanding of the associated mathematical concepts. Students learn that although each representation can give the same information about the linear function, each representation provides a different perspective that makes understanding richer. In addition, this activity uses several of the mathematics teaching practices, highlighted in Principles to Actions: Ensuring Mathematical Success for All, including promoting reasoning and problem solving, using and connecting mathematical representations, and facilitating meaningful mathematical discourse (NCTM 2014).",,
2,Understanding Linear Functions and their Representations - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"This activity was used with five eighth-grade classes at three different schools. The activity contains 15 cards that can be sorted to create 4 sets of cards, with each set representing one particular linear function. Some cards will not fit into any set, which automatically increases the cognitive demand of the task.",,
3,Understanding Linear Functions and their Representations - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Figure 1 shows one complete set of cards (cards 1, 8, and 15), which comprises a context, a graph, and an equation, but no table.",,

5,Understanding Linear Functions and their Representations - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,REASONING WITH RATE OF CHANGE AND VERTICAL INTERCEPTS,,
6,Understanding Linear Functions and their Representations - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"To successfully sort the cards in this task, students must use reasoning and problem solving related to linear functions. For example, because the card sort contains three extra cards that have some similarities to the linear functions being sorted, it is important to analyze both the vertical intercept and the rate of change for each card to sort them accurately. In one eighth-grade class, nearly half the groups of students initially thought that cards 6, 10, and 14 made a set (see fig. 2).",,
7,Understanding Linear Functions and their Representations - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
8,Understanding Linear Functions and their Representations - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The set of cards shown in figure 2 deals with a $20.00 prepaid fare card for a city bus. When students were asked why they had placed these three cards together, most groups focused solely on the fact that these three representations all have the same vertical intercept of (0, 20). When pressed to explain their reasoning further, students also noticed that all the representations show the money remaining on the card getting smaller as the number of rides taken increases. Although these are important relationships, it is also vital to analyze the rate at which the money on the card decreases as the number of rides taken increases. On one hand, the table on card 14 shows the value being reduced by $3.00 for every 3 rides taken, for a decrease of $1.00 per ride. The table on card 12, on the other hand, shows the value being reduced by $3.00 for every 2 rides taken, for a decrease of $1.50 per ride. After reasoning about the situation further, all the groups were able to find the correct group of cards.",,
9,Understanding Linear Functions and their Representations - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In class discussion, several students stated that they were too quick to pick the table on card 14 because it gave the vertical intercept in the table. One student shared an appropriate problem-solving technique of working backward to find a vertical intercept of (0, 20) for the table on card 12. She subtracted 2 from the x-value and added 3 to the y-value until she found the vertical intercept. To reinforce this problem-solving strategy, one class of students was asked, Look at the table on card 13. How would you find the vertical intercept if you didnt have the equation, graph, or context to look at?",,
10,Understanding Linear Functions and their Representations - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"A similar misconception occurred for a few groups when working to find a match for cards 2 and 5 (see fig. 3). These groups were able to explain how the context and equation matched, but struggled to find a graph or table to complete the set. Several groups initially thought the graph on card 9 completed the set. These groups again focused their attention on the vertical intercept of (0, 12) and did not consider the rate of change. Another group realized that the table or graph should show a decreasing relationship and chose the table on card 12 to complete the set. This group focused on the general pattern in the table but not the specific vertical intercept or the specific rate of change.",,
11,Understanding Linear Functions and their Representations - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
12,Understanding Linear Functions and their Representations - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"By the end of the activity, students realized the need for knowing both rate of change and vertical intercept to match the different representations of a linear function. Several students commented that the extra cards made the activity challenging because it was impossible to just find the vertical intercept and be done. Students had to persevere to be sure that every point in a table matched the equation, graph, and context.",,
13,Understanding Linear Functions and their Representations - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"An appropriate way to allow students to extend their problem-solving and reasoning abilities is to discuss if it is really necessary to check every ordered pair to match two representations for a linear function. Interested students could explore why it is necessary to be sure that only two ordered pairs match. For other extensions to reinforce this concept, ask students to (1) create two linear functions that have the same vertical intercept but different rates of change or (2) create two linear functions that have the same rate of change but different vertical intercepts. Students could also create their own set of cards that they think would be challenging for other students to match.",,
14,Understanding Linear Functions and their Representations - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,INTERPRETING RATE OF CHANGE AND VERTICAL INTERCEPT IN CONTEXT,,
15,Understanding Linear Functions and their Representations - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"This activity offers students multiple opportunities to have productive mathematical discussions. Meaningful discourse involves developing understanding through discussion that includes sharing strategies and arguments. Such discussion is fostered when students work together to create sets of matching cards and resolve differences about which cards make a set. Such wide-ranging discussion helps to increase students understanding of vertical intercept and rate of change and their ability to distinguish between the two in a context. Consider, for example, the context given on card 15 (see fig. 4).",,
16,Understanding Linear Functions and their Representations - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
17,Understanding Linear Functions and their Representations - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Several groups of students debated whether the equation given on card 1 (y = 3x + 5) or the equation given on card 3 (y = 5x + 3) better represented the context found on card 15. These groups of students realized that the numbers 3 and 5 were important in the story and should show up in the equation, but they were not sure which number should go where. One student stated, Card 3 is almost the same equation as card 1. This students group was encouraged to discuss these questions posed by their teacher:",,
18,Understanding Linear Functions and their Representations - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,What would I spend if I went on 4 rides? On 6 rides?,,
19,Understanding Linear Functions and their Representations - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"What changes, based on the number of rides, and what stays the same?",,
20,Understanding Linear Functions and their Representations - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,How did you determine the cost for 6 rides?,,
21,Understanding Linear Functions and their Representations - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,These students decided to create a table of values around these questions and used those data to choose the appropriate linear equation. A key understanding that arose from the discussion involved the idea that the independent variable in this scenario serves to count up how many rides were purchased and so should be paired with the cost per ride (rate of change).,,
22,Understanding Linear Functions and their Representations - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"A similar opportunity for meaningful discussion arose when students were asked to create the missing representation for each set of cards. For example, the set consisting of cards 6, 10, and 12 (see fig. 2) was missing an equation. In one eighth-grade class, finding this equation turned into a good discussion point because not all groups had found the same equation and some groups were unable to find an equation at all. Equations found included the following:",,
23,Understanding Linear Functions and their Representations - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,y = 2x + 20,,
24,Understanding Linear Functions and their Representations - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,y = 1.50x + 20,,
25,Understanding Linear Functions and their Representations - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,y = 1.50x + 20,,
26,Understanding Linear Functions and their Representations - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,y = 20  1.50x,,
27,Understanding Linear Functions and their Representations - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In this class, the teacher promoted meaningful discourse by asking students for all the equations they found and then writing them all on the board. Asking students to look for similarities and differences among the equations allowed students to analyze and compare the different equations. Students quickly agreed that all the equations showed a vertical intercept of (0, 20), which matched the information given in the story. (One student even suggested rewriting the fourth equation as y = 1.50x + 20, to make the vertical intercept easier to see.)",,
28,Understanding Linear Functions and their Representations - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Translating the rate of change given in the story to an equation was more challenging and allowed for a rich discussion. Most of the student groups used the context to help them find the equation (thinking about adding or subtracting some number repeatedly), and some of the different equations stemmed from how students interpreted this context. Not all students were familiar with the idea of a prepaid fare card for a bus. When we changed the context to a gift card to a local fast food restaurant (where we always buy the same favorite meal), the students were able to see that the amount remaining on the card would decrease as it was used more times, and so the rate of change must be negative. One students suggestion to create a table for this scenario, in which the x-values increased by 1, also helped other students to more easily see the correct value for the rate of change.",,
29,Understanding Linear Functions and their Representations - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,CONNECTING REPRESENTATIONS: FROM EQUATION TO CONTEXT,,
30,Understanding Linear Functions and their Representations - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Students who deeply understand linear functions are able to make connections among representations and fluently translate among them. One direction that was particularly challenging for many middle school students was to translate from an equation to a context. Students must understand the role the vertical intercept and the rate of change play in the context. Figure 5 shows several stories that students wrote to go along with the equation given on card 4 (y = 0.5x + 3).,,
31,Understanding Linear Functions and their Representations - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
32,Understanding Linear Functions and their Representations - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Some groups of students created a scenario and accurately translated the rate of change and vertical intercept into that scenario, but they varied in the ability to ask a question in the story that would yield the given equation, table, and graph. Some groups asked no question at all (see fig. 5a). Other groups asked a question related to a specific quantity for the independent or dependent variable (see figs. 5b5c), thereby creating a reasonable scenario for solving a related linear equation rather than a question that asks for the relationship between the independent and dependent variables in the scenario. Some groups modified an existing scenario from the linear card sort (see fig. 5d), and other groups devised an entirely new scenario (see fig. 5e and f). Several groups were unsure how to deal with the rate of change and vertical intercept in a context (see fig. 5g).",,
33,Understanding Linear Functions and their Representations - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Asking students to analyze and critique stories written by other students provides a good opportunity to make the connections between representations explicit and to promote meaningful mathematical discourse. For example, asking students to compare and contrast stories in figures 5c and 5d allows them to see that the structures of each story are similar and that both stories show a correct use of the slope and vertical intercept. Analyzing the specific question asked in each of these stories further allows students to discuss the type of question that can be used to describe a relationship between two variables (as in fig. 5d) versus one that asks for a particular value of one variable needed to produce a known value of another variable (as in fig. 5c). This form of discussion also allows students to grapple with determining which variable to choose as the independent variable on the basis of the context; they also begin to understand the importance of labeling both the independent and dependent variables.",,
34,Understanding Linear Functions and their Representations - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Another way to encourage students to make connections among mathematical representations is to explicitly discuss which representations students focused on when beginning to sort the cards. We found that most groups of students began by focusing on just two representations. One group began matching equations to tables by substituting values into the equations to see if they matched the values shown in the tables. This approach reinforced that two representations may match when they agree for multiple ordered pairs (and emphasizes that a function is a way to show a relationship between two varying quantities). Another group began with the contexts and looked for a table that would match the information given in the story. This approach allowed students to immediately engage with vertical intercept and rates of change to see how a change in the independent variable impacts the dependent variable.,,
35,Understanding Linear Functions and their Representations - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Another group began with the equations and identified their rate of change and vertical intercepts and looked for another representation with the same rate of change and vertical intercept. A few groups began by matching graphs to tables. This approach allowed for an explicit discussion of rate of change and the role of scaling in the appearance of a graph. For example, looking superficially at cards 7 and 8, the graphs appear to have similar rates of change. However, the scales on the graphs are quite different and deeper analysis reveals that the rates of change are also quite different (0.5 for the graph on card 7 and card 3 for the graph on card 8).",,
36,Understanding Linear Functions and their Representations - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Asking students to share their strategies for finding matching cards can serve as a way to bring important concepts related to representations of linear functions to the surface and can help groups find more efficient and mathematically sophisticated methods for finding ways of representing the same linear function. It also allows students to gain fluency finding rates of change and vertical intercepts using a variety of representations and allows for a discussion of which representations make the rate of change and vertical intercept easier to find.,,
37,Understanding Linear Functions and their Representations - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,ENCOURAGING REASONING AND PROBLEM SOLVING,,
38,Understanding Linear Functions and their Representations - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"This activity allows students to gain experience with the key concepts of vertical intercept and rate of change in linear functions. Students also learn to recognize those concepts in different representations. Engaging in the activity encourages students to reason and problem solve, use and connect mathematical representations, and participate in meaningful mathematical discourse while deepening their understanding of important concepts related to linear functions.",,
