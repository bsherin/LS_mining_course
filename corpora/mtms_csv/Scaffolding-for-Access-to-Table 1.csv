8,Scaffolding for Access to Productive Struggle,"How might teachers help students gain access to productive struggle? Ms. Lora Bachman found herself considering this question after she gave her students the L problem (Watanabe 2008), which involves finding the area of a composite figure (see fig. 1). To support students in reasoning about the task, Bachman began by asking students what they knew about area. Students responded that area involves the inside of a figure and mentioned the area formula for a rectangle (A = L × W). Despite this discussion, her students still struggled to think productively about the task. They inappropriately extended the area formula for rectangles to composite figures by multiplying all given dimensions (see fig. 2). While reflecting after class, she concluded that although her students struggled, they did not struggle productively: they did not make sense of the mathematical ideas embedded within the task.

37,Scaffolding for Access to Productive Struggle,"She wondered what additional support she might have included when setting up the task. In other words, what role might scaffolding have played before the task was assigned, to provide students with access to productive struggle?",37,Scaffolding for Access to Productive Struggle
38,Scaffolding for Access to Productive Struggle,"The purpose of this article is to introduce scaffolding as a way to provide access to productive struggle. Following a discussion of traditional views of scaffolding, we will introduce a new function for scaffolding. Next, we will return to the L problem to consider how this new function for scaffolding can be applied to support productive struggle. Finally, we will conclude with strategies, such as eliciting prior knowledge, delaying the question, and introducing a simpler problem, for planning access to productive struggle.

40,Scaffolding for Access to Productive Struggle,"In general, scaffolding can be defined as “temporary support provided for the completion of a task that learners otherwise might not be able to complete” (Van de Pol, Volman, and  Beishuizen 2010, p. 272). Wood, Bruner, and Ross (1976) first introduced the term and described six functions of scaffolding. Although Wood and his colleagues discussed scaffolding in terms of tutoring, we present these six functions in relation to teaching (see table 1). As we studied these functions, we noted the different lesson phases within which these functions occurred. Within this framework, scaffolding prior to task engagement is limited to recruitment, which involves gaining students’ interest before they work on the task. On  the basis of Bachman’s lesson, however, we suggest that an additional function of scaffolding can be introduced, one that focuses on scaffolding students’ access to productive struggle. ",40,Scaffolding for Access to Productive Struggle
41,Scaffolding for Access to Productive Struggle,"We propose an additional function for scaffolding that we call access (see table 2). Using the original scaffolding definition as a guide, our definition of scaffolding for access is “temporary support provided prior to task engagement that affords students access to productive struggle that otherwise might not be accessible.” To exemplify this function  of scaffolding, we return to the  L problem in Bachman’s class. ",41,Scaffolding for Access to Productive Struggle
42,Scaffolding for Access to Productive Struggle,REVISITING THE L PROBLEM,42,Scaffolding for Access to Productive Struggle

During this second lesson, she included an additional support during the task setup to provide students with access to productive struggle. Before asking what students knew about area, she distributed grid paper and directed students to draw a rectangle with an area of 12 square centimeters. Next, the students checked each other’s figures for accuracy. Then Bachman asked, “When you were checking your partner’s rectangle, how did you know that the figure had an area of 12 square centimeters?” Students’ strategies included multiplying length by width, counting the squares inside the shape, and thinking about how the dimensions related to factors of 12. ",46,Scaffolding for Access to Productive Struggle
47,Scaffolding for Access to Productive Struggle,"With this additional scaffold,  Bachman’s students were able to struggle productively with the task. The inappropriate extensions of the area formula that occurred in the first lesson (see fig. 2) were not evident in the second lesson. Instead, students solved the task using two primary strategies: decomposing the figure (see fig. 3a) and imposing a grid onto the figure and counting the squares inside (see fig. 3b). By eliciting the appropriate prior knowledge, Bachman’s scaffold provided students with access to productive struggle. ",47,Scaffolding for Access to Productive Struggle

49,Scaffolding for Access to Productive Struggle,"Fig. 3 Students (a) decomposed a figure and (b) imposed a grid.  (a) (b) face the subsequent task. Bachman employed this scaffold, for example, when she asked, “When you were checking your partner’s rectangle, how did you know that the figure had an area of 12 square centimeters?” Students’ responses to this explicit question revealed information that was useful for the upcoming task. In contrast, when general questions are asked, for example, “What do you know about area?” students’ responses are often not as useful as a scaffold. This was evident in Bachman’s first lesson. When key mathematical ideas are the focus, the Elicit Prior Knowledge scaffold gives students a mathematical foundation on which to build as they reason about the task, thus providing access to productive struggle.

51,Scaffolding for Access to Productive Struggle,"As evidenced in Bachman’s second lesson, asking students to draw a rectangle with a specified area provided a scaffold for access. That is, she provided support before students engaged with the task that gave them access to productive struggle that otherwise might not have been accessible. Recognizing the role that scaffolding can play in setting up the task, we present three types of scaffolds for access to productive struggle in the sections that follow. These scaffolds were originally introduced by Barlow and her colleagues (2017) as strategies for helping students  as they explore problems. In reviewing the strategies, however, we recognize their potential for also supporting access to productive struggle. In this section, we describe each strategy as a scaffold for access and present an example appropriate for middle school students. In addition, we discuss the temporary nature of scaffolds.

60,Scaffolding for Access to Productive Struggle,SCAFFOLD: DELAY  THE QUESTION,60,Scaffolding for Access to Productive Struggle
61,Scaffolding for Access to Productive Struggle,"The Delay the Question scaffold “involves sharing the problem  without revealing the question”  (Barlow et al. 2017, p. 555). Using this scaffold allows students to reason about the mathematics within the task before they consider the question. Without knowledge of the question, students make sense of the mathematics within the problem context, thus supporting access to productive struggle when the  question is presented. For example, consider the Race problem  (Watanabe 2015) featured in  figure 4. When we have used this task with middle school students, we first show them only the first two lines of the problem and ask, “Which student is faster? How do you know?” In doing so, we give students the opportunity to consider the role of unit rates within this problem, which in turn provides access to productive struggle when they face the full problem. In general, the key to using the Delay the Question scaffold is to ask questions that highlight or expose the specific mathematical relationships that students will potentially use when solving a problem.",61,Scaffolding for Access to Productive Struggle

64,Scaffolding for Access to Productive Struggle,SCAFFOLD: INTRODUCE  A SIMPLER PROBLEM,64,Scaffolding for Access to Productive Struggle
65,Scaffolding for Access to Productive Struggle,"The Introduce a Simpler Problem scaffold involves posing a problem “that is less complex than the primary problem and provides an opportunity for students to develop key understandings and potential strategies that will likely be useful” (Barlow et al. 2017, p. 552). Using this scaffold, students are able to make sense of the mathematical ideas within the simpler problem, which then allows them to access the more complex problem in a productive way. Consider the Chicken problem featured in figure 5 (Lappan, Smith, and Jones 2012). When we have used this task with seventh-grade students, we have identified three key features of  the problem that are necessary to solve it. First, there is an assumption that the animals’ masses are constant. Second, the information from one frame can be used in other frames. Third, it is not necessary to know the masses of the animals individually to solve the problem. With these assumptions in mind, we created the Cat, Dog, and Rat problem (see fig. 6) as a simpler example to use before presenting the Chicken problem. The Cat, Dog, and Rat problem exposes these three key features necessary for working with the Chicken problem. In this way, the Introduce a Simpler Problem scaffold gives students access to the ideas needed to struggle productively with the primary problem. ",65,Scaffolding for Access to Productive Struggle

67,Scaffolding for Access to Productive Struggle,SCAFFOLDS AS  TEMPORARY SUPPORT,67,Scaffolding for Access to Productive Struggle
68,Scaffolding for Access to Productive Struggle,"By their very nature, scaffolds are intended to be temporary. This is reflected in both the original definition of scaffolding provided by Wood and his colleagues (1976) and our definition of scaffolding for access to productive struggle. All three scaffolds featured in this section are structures imposed by the teacher within the classroom to support students in reasoning about the mathematics or the problem context. However, over time, students will take ownership of those reasoning processes represented within the scaffolds and will use them without being prompted. Once this begins to occur, the teacher can remove the scaffold in the sense that he or she no longer must prompt students to engage in these processes.",68,Scaffolding for Access to Productive Struggle
69,Scaffolding for Access to Productive Struggle,CONCLUSION,69,Scaffolding for Access to Productive Struggle
70,Scaffolding for Access to Productive Struggle,"It can be easy to think of scaffolding as something that only occurs as students are completing a task. Indeed, the majority of Wood and colleagues’ (1976) six functions for scaffolding occurred during the engagement with or discussion of a task. However, to provide access to productive struggle, teachers must often provide scaffolding before students engage with a task, as demonstrated by Bachman’s work on the L problem. From our experiences, purposefully planned scaffolding can determine whether students struggle productively or just simply struggle.",70,Scaffolding for Access to Productive Struggle
71,Scaffolding for Access to Productive Struggle,"Recognizing that the three types of scaffolds presented in this article are likely not the only types of scaffolds for access, we hope to inspire readers to consider ways to present students with opportunities to struggle productively with rich mathematical tasks. Indeed, we would enjoy hearing from readers and receiving descriptions of other types of scaffolds for access that readers find useful in their own classrooms.",71,Scaffolding for Access to Productive Struggle
