"Thomas G. Edwards dDuring my twenty-four years as a  middle school and high school teacher, I observed that students were often fascinated by vignettes from the history of mathematics. When the vignette had an ancient Egyptian setting, that background added a certain mystique. The problem that follows appeared  in the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus, which dates to 1832 BC: ",2,mtms2008-11-252a,,

"I have used this problem with my education students, because it demonstrates an approach to literal equations that engages them in a meaningful discussion that leads to the solution. By definition, a literal equation is one in which some or perhaps all quantities are expressed using letters rather than numbers. For example, y = mx + b is a literal equation. When used in this sense, the word literal means expressed in letters. ",4,mtms2008-11-252a,,
"Some of my education students have, in turn, used the problem successfully with their own middle school students. I have restated the problem in language that I believe is more appropriate for middle school students. The language is closer to that used by Bunt, Jones, and Bedient (1988): ",5,mtms2008-11-252a,,

"The ancient Egyptian scribe Ahmes, who copied the papyrus nearly 4000 years ago, solved the problem by a process called the method of false assumption, also known as the method of false position. I prefer the term false assumption, because it is more descriptive. ",7,mtms2008-11-252a,,
"Solving the problem is equivalent to solving the equation x + (1/7)x = 19 in modern notation. Unfortunately, the ancient scribe had at his disposal neither modern notation nor modern methods for solving equations. How did he solve this problem? He began by assuming a false solution: ",8,mtms2008-11-252a,,
Let x0 = 7.,9,mtms2008-11-252a,,
"The scribe chose 7 because that number simplifies the arithmetic, as we see in the next step: 7 + (1/7)(7) = 7 + 1 = 8",10,mtms2008-11-252a,,
"He reasoned that as many times as 8 must be multiplied to yield 19, 7 must be multiplied some number of times to yield the correct solution. Today, we would say that if 8 must be multiplied by k to yield 19, then 7 must also be multiplied by k to yield the correct solution. We can use modern notation to write the following: If 8k = 19, then, because 8 = 7 + (1/7)(7), it follows that (7 + (1/7)(7))k = 19. If  8k = 19, then k = 19/8. Finally, we have x = x0k, x0 = 7, and k = 19/8, so  x = 7(19/8) = 133/8. ",11,mtms2008-11-252a,,
"At this point, I always pose the  question, “Does it work?” to remind my students to check their work.  To check: 133  133  = 931 56 133 56 1064 56 19  11 +a",12,mtms2008-11-252a,,
"It is interesting to realize that the false assumption that begins the a method is arbitrary. As noted earlier, the scribe chose a value that made the   = arithmetic easier for him, but he might have assumed any nonzero value for x0. For example: Let x0 = 5. Then 5 + (1/7)(5) = 5 + 5/7 = 40/7.  If (40/7)k = 19, then k = 19(7/40) = 133/40. Finally, x = x0k, so x = 5(133/40) = 133/8. The real payoff comes with the questions that follow, beginning with, “Why does this method work?” Since this is a modern question, we should use modern notation and methods. Begin by generalizing the equation x + (1/7)x  = 19. ",13,mtms2008-11-252a,,
"However, suppose we begin by  generalizing the numerical constant: x + (1/7)x = a. Then, proceeding as before, let x0 = 7. Then 7 + (1/7)(7) = 7 + 1 = 8. If 8k = a, then k = a/8. Fi1 1064 nally, x = x0k, so x = 7(a/8) = (7a)/8. 7 56",14,mtms2008-11-252a,,

"In my experience, solving each of  these problems gives students just enough practice to gain the fluency with the method that they will need for the next level of generalization. Since we have already accounted for the solution when the numerical constant is generalized, at this point I ask students what else varies across the original problem and these three problems.

"The activities described here engage students in solving linear equations of a particular form in a novel way. The historical connection and the novelty of the method provide a natural motivation for understanding why the method works. This, in turn, provides an entrée to the solution of literal  equations. However, in this case, the use of literal equations arises naturally as the means to prove that the ancient method of false assumption really does have a mathematically sound basis. Moreover, it engages students in the important use of variables to express generalized relationships. 19",27,mtms2008-11-252a,,
"These student activities are aligned with the Algebra Standard for Grades 6−8 in Principles and Standards for School Mathematics (NCTM 2000) in several ways. To begin with, solving Problem 24 requires students to represent and solve a situation using symbolic algebra (p. 222). When students set up and solve literal equations to learn whether the method of false assumption always works, they will be using symbolic rules to represent, analyze, and generalize a pattern (p. 222). Moreover, this use of literal equations is consistent with the Reasoning and Proof Standard for Grades 6−8, because students will be making and investigating mathematical conjectures, as well as developing and evaluating a mathematical proof (p. 262).
