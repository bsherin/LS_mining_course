  You got 102 centimeters for the 25th figure. So why is it 102?",,
1,Moving Students to the Why_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Student:

  Because I did 23 times 4, plus 10.",,
2,Moving Students to the Why_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Teacher:

  Yes. Good, those are the steps you did. But 
  why

  did you take those steps? How do you know those calculations give you the  right answer?",,
3,Moving Students to the Why_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Student:

  Because you always take the figure number minus two and multiply that by 4 and add 10.",,
4,Moving Students to the Why_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Does this scenario sound familiar? It was a fairly common occurrence in our classrooms as we started to push students to justify their results. We would press for ""the why,"" wanting to hear more about their reasoning, and students would only give us ""the how.""",,
5,Moving Students to the Why_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Having students share their reasoning and explain how they know something is true or correct is the process of justification. This mathematical practice goes by different names. NCTM (2000) describes it as part of the Process Standard of Reasoning and Proof; the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSM) describes it in Mathematical Practice 3 as creating viable arguments and critiquing the reasoning of others (CCSSI 2010). We called this process 
  justification

  . Justification (regardless of the exact term used) is central to doing and learning mathematics and should be incorporated across all grade levels (CCSSI 2010; NCTM 2000).",,
6,Moving Students to the Why_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Teaching in a manner that supports students' justification, however, is extremely challenging. When justifying, students use their prior knowledge and reasoning to connect ideas or to make sense of something new. This process is cognitively demanding for students. Teachers, in turn, must make sense of students' ideas and find ways to help students' refine and build their knowledge.",,
7,Moving Students to the Why_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We share some of our collective learning about teaching with justification, specifically, what we learned about moving students to ""the why."" We (a team of teachers and researchers) worked together for two years with an NSF-funded project called Justification and Argumentation: Growing Understanding of Algebraic Reasoning (JAGUAR). The goal was to better understand what it takes to support students' engagement in justification in middle school mathematics classrooms. We implemented three justification tasks, reflected on the enactment of the tasks, and collaborated around problems of practice. We completed this entire process in two consecutive years.",,
8,Moving Students to the Why_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We discuss three pedagogical foci that helped us better support students in understanding what it meant to offer a justification, as well as getting them started on this process. The three elements are helping students-",,
9,Moving Students to the Why_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,• understand what it means to justify;,,
10,Moving Students to the Why_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,• learn what makes a good justification;,,
11,Moving Students to the Why_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"• generate initial ideas, and then develop those into a justification.",,
12,Moving Students to the Why_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We then discuss some ideas for getting started on growing the practice of justification in the classroom. Although challenging, we have found that incorporating justification in the classroom is well worth the effort.",,
13,Moving Students to the Why_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,HELPING STUDENTS UNDERSTAND WHAT IT MEANS TO JUSTIFY,,
14,Moving Students to the Why_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"When we began our work on justification, as the opening dialogue suggests, we found that students did not seem to understand justification or lacked the tools to respond to prompts such as ""justify your answer,"" ""why are you doing what you are doing?"" or ""how do you know your answer correct?"" Instead of explaining why a calculation was warranted or why a relationship existed, students explained their steps or provided evidence to show that the relationship held (e.g., plugging in numbers to show ""it worked"").",,
15,Moving Students to the Why_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"To illustrate the difference, we consider student responses to the Hexagon task (see 
  fig. 1

  ), one of the justification problems that we implemented each year as part of this project. Columns 1 and 2 of 
  table 1

  offer examples of typical student responses that we do not consider justifications. Rather, these responses (a) recount steps and calculations, showing how one arrives at an answer (column 1); or (b) provide supporting evidence that the relationship holds, without demonstrating why it must hold (column 2). (See, also, Lannin, Barker, and Townsend 2006.) We wanted responses that more closely resembled those in column 3-responses that we consider justifications for students' answers to question 2. One strategy we used to address this challenge was to elongate the question we asked students. For example, instead of asking ""why?"" we asked, ""Why does it make sense that. . . ?"" This revised question prompted students to focus on sense making and reasoning about the relationship. In the case of the Hexagon task, we asked, ""Why does it make sense that the perimeter of the hexagon chain is 4 times the figure number plus 2? Why would that be?"" A student whose response included that ""we saw that it goes up by 4 every time"" might be asked, ""Why does it make sense that the perimeter goes up by 4 every time?"" An additional follow-up question might include a more directive prompt, ""Can you show me that in the diagram?""",,
16,Moving Students to the Why_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
17,Moving Students to the Why_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
18,Moving Students to the Why_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In this and other tasks, we note that students often would see a pattern and would rely on noticing a pattern on a small number of examples as evidence that this pattern always held. Although useful, noting a pattern was not a justification because it did not reveal why that pattern existed or held for all examples or cases. We preferred, ""Why does it make sense that the pattern goes up by 4 each time?"" to ""How do you know that it continues like that?"" (which was another common follow-up question) because students tended to think that it was self-evident that the pattern would continue. A question about sense making pushed them into a new area.",,
19,Moving Students to the Why_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,HELPING STUDENTS LEARN WHAT MAKES A GOOD JUSTIFICATION,,
20,Moving Students to the Why_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In tandem with helping students understand what ""counted"" in response to a ""why"" question or the prompt ""justify your answer,"" we found it was important to have strategies to help students understand what was useful or valuable about one justification relative to another. In other words, what made a good justification? We had many of these conversations among project team members, as well.",,
21,Moving Students to the Why_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"One tool we used was a rubric, either given to students to guide their work or co-developed with students based on conversations about class work. 
  Figure 2

  shows an example of a CLEAR rubric that was given to seventh-grade students. Notice that E (evidence) and R (reasons why) get to the heart of a justification. The other categories focus on communicating ideas clearly. 
  Figure 3

  shows the RACE rubric, which was a grade-level team rubric used to guide persuasive writing. It was used across subjects, such as English/language arts, science, social studies, and math. When used with mathematics, we focused on fleshing out what those criteria looked like in a math class. Other rubrics captured similar features. For example, see Vazquez (2008) for an A-E-I-O-U and always Y rubric. These rubrics were used throughout the year.",,
22,Moving Students to the Why_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
23,Moving Students to the Why_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
24,Moving Students to the Why_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"A second strategy we used to develop an understanding of a ""good"" justification was to discuss sample justifications. These class discussions provided the opportunity to work together for the purposes of creating a shared meaning of justification and establishing the criteria of a ""good"" justification. Part of this process included discussing how to make justifications even better. For example, we presented student work samples (see 
  fig. 4

  ) to the whole class (real or teacher-created) and asked students to make sense of the justification, decide whether they agreed or disagreed, and suggest ways to improve the justification. Among other discussion points, comparing these work samples can highlight the value of various components of the CLEAR rubric, such as labeling, what evidence each student was using, and the student's reasoning. A related strategy we used was peer review, in which students shared their justifications with one another and gave feedback from using a class rubric (e.g., CLEAR or RACE). When guided by a rubric, these discussions helped students develop an understanding of what each category in the rubric might mean in relation to a justification.",,
25,Moving Students to the Why_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Both of these processes (using peer review and discussing sample responses) orient students to an audience beyond the teacher. This brings up the important point that producing a good justification relies on communicating and representing one's ideas to others who will critically evaluate whether a chain of reasoning makes sense and shows something to be true. The peer-review process creates an authentic situation to press on the dual purpose for a justification: to show why something is true to another and to communicate it in a way that another can access.,,
26,Moving Students to the Why_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"A third strategy we used to help students learn what makes a good justification was setting justification goals for lessons. Like content objectives or language objectives (see Echevarría, Vogt, and Short 2008), these goals were ""justification objectives,"" developed to help us think about what our students needed to learn about justifying and guide our planning to help them. Some of us shared these with students; others used them primarily for planning purposes. Here are some examples of justification goals. Students will be able to-",,
27,Moving Students to the Why_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
28,Moving Students to the Why_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,• explain why they cannot use examples to show that something is always true but use an example (or counterexample) to show that something is false;,,
29,Moving Students to the Why_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,• connect the plus-four pattern to the diagram (showing which four sides are added in each time) as evidence that the plus-four pattern continues indefinitely; and,,
30,Moving Students to the Why_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,• analyze diagrams and determine whether the drawing represents a specific case or is generalized.,,
31,Moving Students to the Why_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Proficiency with justification must be developed deliberately over time. Setting justification goals, much like mathematical content goals, helped keep us on track and helped us think about, and break down, how students develop in their abilities to generate and express justifications over time.",,
32,Moving Students to the Why_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,GENERATING AN INITIAL IDEA AND DEVELOPING A JUSTIFICATION,,
33,Moving Students to the Why_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Justifying may be new for many students. We found that initially it was important for us to simply have students share some ideas or thoughts, which then could be developed into clearer and more rigorous justifications. There are many ways to help students access a task and generate some initial ideas. For example, we focused on several strategies: clearly introducing the task, making sure that unfamiliar vocabulary was explained, providing ""private think time,"" and allowing students to represent their ideas in multiple ways (e.g., making drawings, using words, pointing toward the board, moving manipulatives). Similarly, many strategies are possible to help students share or express an initial idea even if not yet well formed, for example, using think-pair-share routines; asking students to write an idea down (either before or after sharing); using public visuals to have students ""show"" what they mean; and emphasizing that the audience for their reasoning is the class, not just the teacher.",,
34,Moving Students to the Why_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Our work was most effective when we built on and developed students' thinking, even when it did not match how we were thinking, or what we thought was the ""best"" approach. If we did not consistently work to build on students' ideas, it would undermine efforts to get students to generate and then develop their own ideas toward a more complete justification.",,
35,Moving Students to the Why_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"This work required careful listening by the teacher and making deliberate efforts to develop students' ideas. The main point is that justification is about reasoning: It cannot be the teacher's reasoning; it has to be the students' reasoning. The commitment to building on students' thinking involves managing mistakes (see also Hoffman, Breyfogle, and Dressler 2009); finding what is productive in what students do; and figuring out how much to ""give"" students to support, but not override, their thinking.",,
36,Moving Students to the Why_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,GETTING STARTED,,
37,Moving Students to the Why_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Getting students to justify is not something that happens simply by asking them to justify. After two years of work on this project, we are still in the process of developing our pedagogical strategies to support students' process of justification. In addition to the strategies we discussed (helping students understand what it means to justify, learning what makes a good justification, and generating initial ideas and developing them), we offer the following tips from our experiences.",,
38,Moving Students to the Why_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Pick a lesson and start small:

  Choose a lesson that you are comfortable with and design a small task that includes a ""why"" question, but not as the first question. Have the students work in pairs to solve the problem and share their solution (answers and reasoning) with the class. This gets them working together, communicating with one another, and conveys that we value what they do and think.",,
39,Moving Students to the Why_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Link justification in math class with students' other experiences:

  The written part of the justification process can easily link to what the students do in language arts when they write a five-paragraph persuasive essay. Their language arts teacher asks them to be sure to include supporting details, and we are looking for the same thing with a written justification in math.",,
40,Moving Students to the Why_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Interweave justification opportunities throughout the year:

  If you have started focusing on justification in a few, key lessons (as most of us did), a next step is to make justification a daily presence in your classroom. If you do not already, ask ""why"" questions during a warm-up, even in relation to procedural topics (e.g., how do we know that 2/7 is the same as 4/14?). Elicit more than one response. Listen carefully to, and build on, students' reasoning. Do not simply listen for the one correct answer.",,
41,Moving Students to the Why_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Be patient with yourself:

  Sometimes lessons will exceed your expectations, revealing the wonderful thinking of your students. Other times, a lesson may be hit-and-miss, and you may be disappointed with the results. Be patient with yourself and know that you, like your students, are learning. Reflect on the lesson, try to diagnose the issue, and try another lesson. We have found that lessons ""fly"" when they are not overly structured, thus allowing room for student thinking, but not understructured, making the target unclear or producing such divergent thinking from students that it is hard to find common ground and have students analyze arguments. Finding this balance takes time.",,
42,Moving Students to the Why_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"If you have a colleague interested in doing this work, collaborate:

  It is always more fun and productive to work with a colleague. Co-plan lessons in which you brainstorm key questions to prompt justification and anticipate the variety of solutions that students might offer. You can also use NCTM articles with student work to help you anticipate students' approaches and how you might respond to develop the ideas. (See Smith et al. 2009 for a helpful approach.) It is impossible to anticipate all student responses, but the more you can anticipate, the more prepared you might feel to draw out students' partially formed thinking.",,
43,Moving Students to the Why_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,KEEPING YOUR EYE ON THE PRIZE,,
44,Moving Students to the Why_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"With the constant push for skill development and urgency of meeting standardized testing goals, it is easy to question how you can take the time to allow students to justify their thinking in math class. It is important to remember that if we are teaching mathematics, we must include mathematical reasoning in our daily lessons. Mathematics is a tool we use to analyze, explore, and build new understandings from discoveries made by others. Those understandings and the process of justification are not only interconnected and lasting but also allow knowledge to continually be developed, revised, and extended. What could be more important?",,
