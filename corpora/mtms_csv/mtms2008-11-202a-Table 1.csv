"Mathematics advocates an experimentation approach to middle-grades geometry study (NCTM 2000). Students are asked to explore and examine a variety of geometric shapes and discover their characteristics and properties using hands-on materials. They also create inductive arguments about the Pythagorean relationship. This empirical approach to the Pythagorean theorem, for example, will lay the foundation for analytical proofs. ",1,mtms2008-11-202a,,
"Incorporating experimentation  as part of middle school geometry is also consistent with research on how students learn best. According to van Hiele, students need opportunities  to develop their geometric thinking through five levels: (1) visualization, (2) analysis, (3) informal deduction, (4) deduction, and (5) rigor (Fuys, Geddes, and Tischler 1988; van Hiele 1986). Levels 2 and 3, analysis and informal deduction, are especially relevant in the middle grades. At the analysis level, students can go beyond their perception of shapes and analyze the components, parts, and properties of shapes. Students use descriptions instead of definitions. They also discover and prove properties or rules  by folding, measuring, or using a grid or a diagram. At the informal deduction level, students learn the role of definitions, analyze the relationships between figures, order figures hierarchically according to their characteristics, and deduce facts logically from previously accepted facts using informal arguments. The activities presented here will help students make the transition from level 2, analysis, to level 3, informal deduction. ",2,mtms2008-11-202a,,

"so that the strips can be bent easily.) Paste the strips on the mat along the outside of the figures with instant glue. Make the fence for the inner right triangle separately and do not glue it down, since it will be removed during the experiment. Estimating the area with jelly beans works well as long as students abstain from eating the candy because (1) jelly beans are easy to layer; (2) empty space, or gaps, around the jelly beans will be kept to a minimum; and (3) students like the bright colors. Although jelly beans are three- dimensional objects, we are using one  layer, which is two dimensional. In this activity, students will not have to count the number of jelly beans to compare areas. The activities are designed to allow students to move jelly beans from one section of the mat to another to see whether or not all the jelly beans fit into a new shape. ",20,mtms2008-11-202a,,
"There are several ways in which  the activities could be conducted. The teacher can demonstrate the first activity and discuss the relationship between the areas of the squares. Students can also work with the mat in groups. Different groups could be  given different mats based on different shapes, such as isosceles right triangles (see fig. 2c) and scalene right triangles (fig. 3), and then compare results. Students could move from one station to the next, where the layout of each mat is different, and conduct a similar experiment.  activitY 1: the PYthagoRean RelationshiP Students will use a mat that consists of a right triangle with squares on each of the three sides. With the cardboard fence glued around the three squares, students insert the triangular fence around the triangle (see fig. 2b). They should notice that a square is formed on each side of the right triangle. Students fill the two squares on the legs of the right triangle with jelly beans, ensuring that jelly beans completely fill the two squares without overlapping, forming just one layer (see fig. 2c). Next, students remove  the cardboard triangle that is inside the frame and push all the jelly beans into the square on the hypotenuse (see fig. 4a). Finally, they re-insert the triangular fence and flatten the layer of jelly beans. Students verify whether the jelly beans completely cover the square on the hypotenuse (see fig. 4b). The teacher guides students to explicitly express in their own words what they found about the sum of the areas of the squares on the legs of the right triangle compared with the area of the square on the hypotenuse. Then students label the two legs of the right triangle as a and b, and the hypotenuse as c, and express the relationship using an algebraic equation: a 2 + b 2 = c 2.",21,mtms2008-11-202a,,

"three semicircles adjacent to each side of a right triangle (see fig. 5a). The diameters of the semicircles are the sides of the right triangle. With the cardboard fence around the three semicircles glued to the mat, students insert the triangular fence around the right triangle. They need to notice that the two fences together form three semicircles on the sides of the right triangle (see fig. 5b). When making the structure for students, be sure that the arcs are precise semicircles. In the same way as in the first activity, students pour one layer of jelly beans in the two semicircles on the legs of the right triangle, completely covering the two semicircles  (see fig. 6). Then they remove the cardboard triangle that is inside the frame and slide the jelly beans into the semicircle on the hypotenuse. Next, they re-insert the triangular fence, flatten the layer of jelly beans, and verify whether the jelly beans completely cover the semicircle on the hypotenuse. Students can describe in their own words the relationship they see between the sum of the areas of the semicircles on the legs of the right triangle and the area of the semicircle on the hypotenuse.

"The teacher will also guide  students to see that in each of the activities, the three shapes on the sides of the right triangle are similar to each other, that is, squares are similar to other squares, and semicircles are similar to other semicircles. These two activities correspond to van Hiele’s level 2, because the verifications are done empirically.",27,mtms2008-11-202a,,
"Other Extensions Students can also experiment with different shapes constructed on the sides of the right triangle, as long as all three shapes are similar and their corresponding sides are placed on  the sides of the right triangle (see  figs. 7a and 7b).

"c2 c2 a2 a2 c1 c1 a1 a1 activitY 3: FoRMUlas FoR the aReas oF the seMiciRcles and connections with algeBRa Students can derive the extension of the Pythagorean theorem with semicircles by using some algebraic skills, such as factoring and simplifying algebraic expressions. They can do this activity working in pairs or small groups. Students can denote the two legs of the right triangle as a and b, and the hypotenuse as c (see fig. 5a) and express the relationship among the areas of the squares on the sides of the right triangle as a2 + b2 = c2. They need also remember that the diameter of each semicircle is congruent to the corresponding side of the triangle and that the sum of the areas of the semicircles on the legs of the right triangle is  equal to the area of the semicircle on the hypotenuse. The teacher can guide students to write algebraic expressions for the areas of the semicircles and for their relationships. Students can write an algebraic expression for each radius of the semicircles in terms of the length of each side of the triangle and write an expression for the area of each semicircle. They can use algebraic notation to state that the sum of the areas of the semicircles on legs a and b of the right triangle is equal to the area of the semicircle on xxxxxx the hypotenuse, c:    + ×    ",34,mtms2008-11-202a,,
"Students then factor and simplify  both sides of the equation to show that it is equivalent to the equation a2 + b2 = c2. To verify, they can reverse all the steps; starting with a2 + b2 = c2, they can show how to obtain from this equation the relation among semicircles. This activity corresponds to van Hiele’s level 3 because students make deductive arguments based on previously accepted facts. ",35,mtms2008-11-202a,,
"Fig. 8 crescents formed by semicircles c2 a2 activitY 4: aRea oF the cRescents oF hiPPocRates Hippocrates of Chios, a Greek mathematician from the fifth century BC, discovered that two figures bounded by arcs of circles have the same area as a figure bounded by straight lines. In figure 8, semicircles are constructed on the sides of right triangle ABC. However, the semicircle on the hypotenuse, rather than being on the outside of the triangle as in activity 2, is drawn on the inside. Students who have difficulty seeing this semicircle could look at three semicircles on the outside of a right triangle, as in figure 5a, and then think of reflecting the largest semicircle across the hypotenuse. The semicircle on the hypotenuse overlaps with the triangle (in yellow) and also overlaps partially with the semicircles on the legs (shown in green). The part of the semicircle on each leg that is completely outside the semicircle on the hypotenuse makes a crescent (shown in blue). Students can express the area of the semicircle on the hypotenuse as t + a1 + a2 (see fig. 8). The areas of the semicircles on the legs are c1 + a1 and c2 + a2. Using their discovery that the area of the semicircle on the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the areas of the semicircles on the legs of the right triangle and the expression of areas stated above, students can find a relation between the sum of the areas of the two crescents and the area of  c1 a1 the right triangle ABC. This activity also corresponds to level 3’s informal deduction.  conclUding ReMaRks",36,mtms2008-11-202a,,
"Many students find that they dislike mathematics when they are asked to simply memorize what they cannot verify and understand on their own. When the Pythagorean theorem is first introduced using a deductive approach, students often have difficulty following the steps of the proofs. Even when they manage to follow each step to reach the conclusion, many students do not understand what it means. An approach that proves the Pythagorean theorem using only axioms or previously demonstrated theorems corresponds to axiomatic deduction, which is consistent with van Hiele’s level 4. Students experience difficulties in a deductive presentation because level 4 work does not correspond to levels 2 and 3, where most students in the middle grades operate. ",37,mtms2008-11-202a,,
"In the case of the Pythagorean theorem, students are sometimes confused about what areas they need to add to find a specific area measurement and what segments are being compared. There are computer programs that allow students to visualize the relationship. However, such programs usually ask students to simply believe the theorem, because all they  can do is watch untouchable moving objects. The jelly beans activities are helpful for students because they can experiment directly with concrete objects to understand the Pythagorean theorem conceptually, rather than just memorizing or applying a formula. Students are less prone to forget what areas added together are equal to what other area. When the teacher prepares more activities using not only squares on the sides but also semicircles, students remember the mathematics better. They are surprised by the results and work to establish connections between the different cases by using algebraic notation. ",38,mtms2008-11-202a,,
"These activities using jelly beans are beneficial not only for students. Prospective and in-service teachers also enjoy doing the activity. By  removing the fence and sliding the jelly beans from the smaller shapes on the legs of the triangle to the bigger shape on the hypotenuse, they are verifying that indeed the shape gets covered (Yun 2007) and that there is a relationship among the sides and the hypotenuse of a right triangle.",39,mtms2008-11-202a,,
