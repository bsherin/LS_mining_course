"Have you ever come across different definitions for a mathematics term in textbooks? I have. My recent encounter with definitions for trapezoids has raised questions in my mind about the implications of what we teach to students, what is meant in documents concerning standards and definitions, and how assessment deals with the variety of definitions.

"My ponderings about this dual- definition situation have led me to wonder how the existence of different definitions plays out in students’ learning of mathematics. According  to Vinner (1991), definitions are manmade and thus arbitrary. He argues that a lack of understanding about the arbitrary nature of definitions can cause a great deal of problems. In addition, Vinner argues that “to know by heart a concept definition does not guarantee the understanding of the concept” (p. 69). He suggests that to understand means to have a concept image, a nonverbal something in our memory associated with a particular concept. Once a concept image is formed, students rarely refer back to formal definitions of a concept. For example, we do not refer to definitions of a table, a car, or a building to understand the meaning of a sentence that contains these words. Rather, when we hear the word table, for example, we associate it with an image from our experience of a specific table.",10,mtms2012-11-196a,,

"Two different definitions of a trapezoid are commonly found in mathematics textbooks. On one hand, the Connected Mathematics Project’s (CMP) Shapes and Designs book uses an inclusive definition of a trapezoid, and a parallelogram is considered a special case of a trapezoid:",12,mtms2012-11-196a,,

"Both books, however, take similar approaches to teaching their definition of a trapezoid. The CMP curriculum allows students first to explore the properties of different shapes and then to classify them according to one or more properties they have in common. Thus, students develop the ability to differentiate among shapes according to their properties. Much later in the unit, students are introduced to the terminology above, describing a trapezoid.",16,mtms2012-11-196a,,
"Similarly, the Discovering Geometry text gives students the opportunity to first explore properties of trapezoids by asking them to examine examples and nonexamples of trapezoids. This property exploration is consistent with the corresponding definition of a trapezoid above. Next, students are asked to develop their own definitions. The discussion then leads to specifying Definition 2 (see above) as the definition of a trapezoid. Obviously, both approaches are consistent with constructivist learning theory that states that students should actively participate in  roles. Consider the question listed in figure 1. Before you continue reading, solve it first using definition 1, then using definition 2.",17,mtms2012-11-196a,,
"Clearly, depending on the definition used for instruction, two different answers can be expected from students. Those who have learned that a trapezoid is a quadrilateral that has at least one pair of parallel sides will likely circle shapes (a), (b), (c), and (d). Students who have learned that a trapezoid is a quadrilateral that has exactly one pair of parallel sides will likely circle shapes (a), (b), and (c). ",18,mtms2012-11-196a,,
"However, some students might fail to include shape (b) as an example of a trapezoid, even though it satisfies both definitions: It is a quadrilateral that has at least/exactly one pair of parallel sides. Such an outcome will most likely occur because students seldom encounter trapezoids in which the altitude to the lower base falls outside the figure itself. For example, the Shapes and Designs textbook does not include a shape similar to (b) at all. The Discovering Geometry textbook, however, includes a shape that, if it is not carefully observed, looks like a right trapezoid. ",19,mtms2012-11-196a,,
"The question in figure 1 could be used to begin a lesson that introduces students to the term trapezoid by giving them these shapes as examples. By subsequently sorting out additional shapes as trapezoids and nontrapezoids, students will begin to develop a concept image of trapezoids. Students can then be asked to generate their own definitions, thereby nudging them to pay attention to the specific properties of this particular shape.",20,mtms2012-11-196a,,
Their definitions can be compared  and contrasted to one another and eventually to the various definitions found in textbooks. Such an activity would help students understand the arbitrariness of definitions and the human role in developing definitions. A conversation can then ensue con- fig. 1 This problem will elicit different responses on the basis of the definition of trapezoid that is used. ,21,mtms2012-11-196a,,

concerns on My Mind,71,mtms2012-11-196a,,
"Technically, definitions are arbitrary. I have illustrated that at least two definitions of trapezoids appear in textbooks, and that these two definitions determine at least two hierarchical classifications of quadrilaterals. In my experience, given that arbitrariness of mathematical definitions is not addressed in school mathematics, I have some serious concerns about middle school mathematics.  1.  Do middle school students have the ",72,mtms2012-11-196a,,

"Kite opportunity to understand the idea of the arbitrary nature of definitions? I do know that students will not learn what we do not teach them. In most cases, students learn mathematics as it is presented and organized in the mathematics curriculum chosen by their school. Therefore, I am concerned that most students learn only definitions consistent with the textbook they use, rather than being given the opportunity to explore alternative definitions and how, depending on a definition, they can draw varied conclusions.  2.  How does the arbitrariness of  definitions relate to curriculum  standards and assessment?  As mentioned, the geometry standard 5.G.4 in CCSSM states that students should understand and be able to “Classify twodimensional figures in a hierarchy based on properties” (CCSSI 2010, p. 38). Previous discussion showed that, depending on the definition learned, a variety of hierarchical classifications could be developed. I wonder how assessment will ",74,mtms2012-11-196a,,
"Square (b) deal with this situation. One way would be to refrain from including ambiguous items in assessment. However, is it possible to avoid all problems that show ambiguity? For example, one teacher I work with shared the discussion between a sixth-grade math teacher and a sixth-grade math lab teacher regarding the number of sides that a cone has. The math teacher argued, “None,” based on the definition given in the textbook; a side is a polygon. (The curriculum used was Everyday Math.) In contrast, the lab teacher, who does not have a curriculum book and puts her text together, suggested that the answer is one side, because a side is a flat surface. Unfortunately for their students, this discussion took place during a minilesson that the lab teacher held prior to the Illinois Standards Achievement Test (ISAT) testing. I can only assume how confusing this was for students. Furthermore, I am concerned that once it is clear that students’ understanding of some topics is not assessed, those particular topics will not be taught with the same emphasis as the  topics included in the assessment. In other words, students will be denied knowledge necessary for their future mathematics education. In particular, a hierarchical classifi cation of concepts gives students the opportunity to explore underlying relationships between those concepts,  leading to better retention (De Villiers 1994). This experience is essential for their future study of mathematics, since classifying concepts in a hierarchy appears repeatedly in mathematics (e.g., in the classifi cation of real numbers).",75,mtms2012-11-196a,,
"What do you think? I am sure our  community of mathematics educators and mathematics teachers wants students to learn mathematics and mathematical practice. For myself, I know that mathematical defi nitions  are arbitrary; that books do use different defi nitions; and that people who write standards, curricula, and assessments should take this into account.
