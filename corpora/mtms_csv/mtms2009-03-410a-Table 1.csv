"Students’ problem-solving skills are enhanced  grade mathematics class by entering the following problem of the day on the computer and transmitting the image to the television screen for her students’ early morning work. This was the problem  of the day: the community together. The town square is the social gathering place; however, it is not a perfect square. Its length is 180 meters, and its width is 140 meters. The town square must be decorated for the festival. Colorful crepe paper will be displayed around the perimeter of the town square. How much crepe paper will be needed to decorate the perimeter? If the crepe paper is sold in rolls of 90 meters, how many rolls  of crepe paper will need to be ordered by the planning committee?  Alex, one student in the class, tried several different ways to complete the problem. He was hoping that one of his classmates might know where to begin, because he was very confused.

Solving a complex mathematics  problem individually can be stressful for many middle school students. The notion that students are expected to do just that is commonplace. Teachers often use assignments similar to the one  in this scenario as opportunities for students to practice skills and review concepts. ,6,mtms2009-03-410a,,
"Although independent work is an  essential and viable strategy, working as part of a team in a cooperative setting creates an atmosphere where learners feel empowered. An excellent way to facilitate group interaction is by presenting students with opportunities to talk with one another and write about ways to solve mathematics problems. Research by Alvermann and Phelps (2002) confirms that students’ understanding of overall mathematical conceptualization improves with talking and writing in the mathematics classroom. With the onslaught of mandated testing, it is imperative that students have an opportunity to share their mathematical reasoning with their peers. Talking about mathematical problems and writing down ideas are two ways to improve students’ performance in a middle school mathematics classroom.",7,mtms2009-03-410a,,

"According to Vygotsky (1978), constructing learning happens in the context of interacting with others. This social interaction occurs naturally through talking and writing in the classroom. Peer discussions expose students to higher-level questioning and prompt students’ divergent thinking. Written expression allows students to develop sequential, logical reasoning. ",9,mtms2009-03-410a,,
"The opportunity for students to speak and write about mathematical ideas is critical to their understanding of the subject. According to Principles and Standards for School Mathematics (NCTM 2000, p. 60), “Students who have opportunities, encouragement, and support for speaking, writing, reading, and listening in mathematics  ing teachers to generate and implement classroom activities that enable all students to “communicate their mathematical thinking coherently and clearly to peers, teachers, and others” as well as “use the language of mathematics to express mathematical ideas precisely” (NCTM 2000, p. 348).",10,mtms2009-03-410a,,

"Alex and a classmate continued to struggle with the town square problem of the day. Within their small group, they chose an idea from the list to investigate as a way to solve the problem. Using one of the strategies Miss Cravener had previously introduced, they decided to “phone a friend” from a different group to find out how to solve the problem. The “phone a friend” philosophy is based on the concept that students can make sense of mathematics when set in a social context. As students talk their way through the problem of the day and share their responses, questions, and confusions, they have a better chance of developing insight. The “phone a friend” experience provides interesting interpretations of mathematical concepts and allows students to take on the different roles of speaker and listener. ",12,mtms2009-03-410a,,
"Alex asked a classmate from another group for help,  which required him to explain mathematical concepts and use terminology discussed in the problem. The friend reminded him about the meaning of perimeter. After talking with the friend, Alex realized that he needed to determine the measurement of all four sides of the town square before calculating the perimeter. He was then able to solve the problem. Immediately, he calculated the perimeter of the town square as 640 meters. Since each roll of crepe paper was 90 meters long, he divided 640 meters by 90 using a calculator. Alex realized that eight rolls of the crepe paper would need to be purchased by the planning committee to outline the perimeter of the town  allowing students to discuss  mathematics is empowering.",13,mtms2009-03-410a,,
"classes reap dual benefits: they communicate to learn mathematics, and they learn to communicate mathematically.” Talking and writing not only builds a community of learners, but it also helps to develop a broader view of mathematics and its connection to real life. Additionally, the strategies for sharing information and valuing classmates’ ideas have merit beyond the realms of mathematics instruction, such as communication and social skills. ",14,mtms2009-03-410a,,
"The focus for the contemporary mathematics classroom must move beyond a curricular emphasis on skills and should consider aspects of communication and problem solving. Students must use mathematics in learning how to read, write, listen, speak, and think (Draper 2002). According to NCTM (2000), the crux of mathematics instruction is that students must realize that mathematics is important and has value. Students must be able to articulate their mathematical understanding and think mathematically to solve problems. The NCTM (2000) further states that students must be mathematically literate. Therefore, mathematics educators must expand their teaching practices to provide these opportunities for students (Neilsen 1998). The deliberate inclusion of talking and writing in the mathematics classroom can help  educators foster students’ mathematical literacy. The following scenario illustrates this tenet.",15,mtms2009-03-410a,,
"As Miss Cravener seeks students’ best ideas from their mathematics journals, she records them on newsprint, the chalkboard, or a whiteboard. She asks her students to read the choices, and she selects an option that suits the group. ",16,mtms2009-03-410a,,

"Miss Cravener’s class, students must interact with one another, sharing the roles of listener and speaker. They have an opportunity to brainstorm and come to a consensus about which approach to try. Some students may refer to their journal notes or other students’ written ideas when making these choices.",18,mtms2009-03-410a,,
"In reading the list of students’ re- sponses, the discussion allows students to clarify, elaborate, or revise their own ideas. This seemingly minor instructional activity becomes a significant learning opportunity in which students’ original ideas are transformed into a collective text. This action on the part of the teacher provides an excellent writing model for students as they develop their ideas by writing. Her actions support the NCTM’s Principles and Standards by challeng- square, because seven rolls would not be enough. After understanding the meaning of perimeter, the task became a sequential series of mathematical steps. Through talking and writing with classmates, Alex was given the tools necessary for success. The opportunity to talk with classmates enabled students to pursue the information they needed to solve the problem. ",19,mtms2009-03-410a,,
"Talking and writing constitute the  most essential elements in the development of students’ mathematical understanding. Pairing talking and writing enables students to connect familiar language from their own experiences and backgrounds with the language of the classroom and of mathematics. Huinker and Laughlin (1996) state that talking fosters collaboration and helps to build a learning community in a classroom. Writing enables students to independently record their thinking. Their written words facilitate peer discussions. When students are given opportunities to talk and write about mathematics, they realize that their thinking can be valuable to classmates. This process creates a community of learners within the classroom. “Students must communicate with others to gain information; share thoughts and discoveries; brainstorm, evaluate, and sharpen ideas and plans; and convince others” (Greenes and Schulman 1996).",20,mtms2009-03-410a,,
"inTegRaTing TalKing inTo The MaTheMaTics classRooM To generate meaningful conversation in mathematics class, teachers can read aloud to the class a variety of books suitable for middle school learners (Richardson 2000). The stories show how classroom mathematics can be applied in the real world (Carr et al. 2001). Reading and discussing mathematical content promotes analysis and critical thinking (Richardson 2000).

"Sharing information and valuing classmates’ ideas have merit beyond mathematics instruction reading to middle school learners should contain thought-provoking issues and moral dilemmas that are developmentally appropriate (Carr et al. 2001). After reading The Math Curse, students could discuss Mrs. Fibonacci’s  word problems and create their own mathematics problems about time management, combinations of clothing selections, and social schedules. As Mrs. Fibonacci says, “Math is just about everywhere!” Using literature selections in  middle school mathematics instruction is unexpected; thus, these books become a motivating influence. When students begin discussing and responding to the literature, they move logically into the content. The teacher facilitates students’ discussion to help connect the text with the mathematics concept. A valuable literary discussion will be marked by students’ comparing, closely observing, intensely questioning, and relating life experiences to the story. ",22,mtms2009-03-410a,,
"On the basis of the students’ need to interact and to talk with their peers after listening to various literary selections, teachers can use a seating arrangement that is conducive to largegroup instruction or small-group work. If student desks are arranged in an L shape for chalkboard and board work, desks can be easily shaped into groups of four by swinging the long end of the L into the middle. This quick transformation arranges the groups into conversation tables. This desk design allows students to talk with their group members about mathematical ideas gleaned from the literature and make important connections to the concept being investigated. ",23,mtms2009-03-410a,,
"Students need to discuss solutions to problems, exchange ideas, do hands- on activities, and share their mathematical thinking. Conversation tables facilitate this experience. Teachers can informally assess students’ understanding while rotating among the groups. Thus, the value of talking and listening while sharing ideas in mathematics class is indispensable for middle school learners and their teachers.  inTegRaTing WRiTing inTo The MaTheMaTics classRooM Many state-mandated assessments include open-ended mathematics questions that require students to write in order to communicate their mathematical ideas. Performing this skill requires deliberate instruction and focused practice. Teachers should provide writing opportunities on a regular basis in mathematics class. Writing journals can be incorporated in all areas of the curriculum, including mathematics (Ross 1998). Maintaining a mathematics journal allows students to reflect on their thinking and can also serve as a portfolio to showcase their progress. Teachers can review students’ journals periodically to note progress in mathematical written expression and conceptual understanding. ",24,mtms2009-03-410a,,
"Having students use appropriate  mathematical terminology when they write about their thinking is an essential literacy skill (Brown 2005). This writing-to-learn process can be incorporated in all levels of middle school mathematics. The purpose for writing to learn is meant to be a catalyst for further learning (Knipper and Duggan 2006). Writing in mathematics classrooms is imperative for students to describe their thinking processes, their methodology for solving problems, and their explanations for solutions. ",25,mtms2009-03-410a,,
"Thus, writing in all middle school mathematics classes enhances students’ mathematical learning, improves their written expression, and becomes part of the total instructional process.  conclusion",26,mtms2009-03-410a,,
"Despite efforts to incorporate talking and writing instruction across all areas of the middle school curriculum, some content-area teachers may be reluctant to take up the cause (O’Brien, Stewart, and Moje 1995). The reason is unclear. However, since all teachers seek strategies that can potentially improve student performance, the pairing of talking and writing may be such a catalyst. With the rigors and demands of the middle school mathematics curriculum and state-mandated assessments, finding sufficient time to incorporate talking and writing requires extra effort.
