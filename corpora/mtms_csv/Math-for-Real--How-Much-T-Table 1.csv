4,Math for Real: How Much Time Will Lena Save?,Lena is at the corner of a park that is 200 meters × 300 meters. An ice cream stand is at the opposite corner. She can walk along the edge of the park or walk across the park diagonally to get to the ice cream stand. Which route is faster and by how much? Use the following questions to explore this problem:  1.  What will be Lena’s total distance walked if she walks along the edge of the park? ,4,Math for Real: How Much Time Will Lena Save?

Manuscripts should show how math is used to solve a real-life problem, preferably in the context of one’s profession, and should be no more than 300 words. Submit manuscripts through http://mtms.msubmit.net.  4. What percentage of the distance will Lena save with the shorter route? (Round to the nearest percentage.) 5.  If Lena walks 1.4 meters per  second, how much time will she save by walking the shorter route? (Round to the nearest second.) 6.  Suppose that James challenges Lena to a race to the ice cream stand. Lena will run along the edge, and James will walk diagonally at 1.4 meters per second across the park. Approximately how fast will Lena need to run to arrive before James? Is this a reasonable running pace?",8,Math for Real: How Much Time Will Lena Save?
