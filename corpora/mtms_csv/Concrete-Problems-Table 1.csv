3,Concrete Problems,"James Metz aA city is planning to build a park that  will include several walking areas. The City Council considered whether to use brick pavers, gravel, asphalt, or concrete and ﬁ nally decided on concrete. Concrete is made by combining construction aggregate (such as gravel, crushed rock, sand, etc.) with cement and water. Concrete has been used for thousands of years and is the most widely used manmade material (https://en.wikipedia.org/ wiki/Concrete).",3,Concrete Problems
4,Concrete Problems,"1.  A circular garden with a diameter of 8 ft. has 4 sidewalks leading to it, as shown in the ﬁ gure below. The length of each sidewalk is 28 ft. How many yards of concrete are needed for the 4 sidewalks?  4.  If the cost of 1 yard of concrete  is $90 and the delivery fee is $60, what is the cost of the concrete if the contractor makes all the depths 4 in.? ",4,Concrete Problems
5,Concrete Problems,"Concrete is sold by the cubic yard, usually shortened to “yard.” The contractor needs to determine how many yards are needed for the project. The concrete is to be 4 in. deep where it is laid.",5,Concrete Problems
