Alex Friedlander stories about never-ending  suMs,0,mtms2009-12-274a,,
"Infinity and infinitely small numbers pique the curiosity of middle  school students. Examples such as the story of Achilles and  the Tortoise promote questions about domain, representations,  and infinite sums—all of which may not get answered   until students reach high school.",1,mtms2009-12-274a,,
"fFrom a very young age, many students are intrigued, interested, and even fascinated by extremely large or extremely small numbers or quantities. The activity described here takes this curiosity about infinity into the domain of adding the numbers of an infinite sequence. In some cases, adding up a very large number of terms such as allows us to get as close as we wish to a certain number (1, in this case), without exceeding or reaching that limit.",2,mtms2009-12-274a,,
"Almost two and a half millennia ago, the Greeks encountered this problem when they dealt with philosophical questions about the nature of movement. Zeno designed a set of paradoxical situations that involved the aggregation of an infinite number of increasingly smaller quantities or periods of time (see p. 279’s sidebar  about Achilles and the tortoise). These seemingly real-life situations provoke some philosophical questions regarding the nature of movement and the need for a mathematical analysis of infinite sums of progressively smaller numbers. Archimedes (about 300 years after Zeno) and, at a much later stage, the founders of calculus (about 350 years ago) developed the concepts and methods needed to deal mathematically with the sum of infinitely  definitions sequence: An ordered list, which can be finite or infinite and may or may not follow a pattern",3,mtms2009-12-274a,,
"Example 1: 3, 7, 10, 25",4,mtms2009-12-274a,,
Example 2:                   series: The sum of a numerical sequence,5,mtms2009-12-274a,,
Example 1: 3 + 7 + 10 + 25,6,mtms2009-12-274a,,
"Example 2:                  Note: In this article, the sums of infinite sequences, or infinite series, are discussed.",7,mtms2009-12-274a,,
"many terms that get progressively smaller. For example, it can be shown that if we keep adding terms to  and to  each sum will continue to grow, but the first sum will be bounded by 1, whereas the second will grow indefinitely. The definitions of concepts related to infinity and to infinite sums were fully formalized only about 150 years ago.",8,mtms2009-12-274a,,
"As a result of its complex history  and its relatively late development, the topic of infinite sequences and their corresponding sums is considered to be advanced and is therefore formally taught in calculus classes at the high school or college levels.",9,mtms2009-12-274a,,
"Some of the activities that I  present to groups of mathematically advanced students relate in an informal manner to unlearned concepts or procedures. I have found that although these activities can be mathematically challenging to students, they provide them with an intuitive, concrete acquaintance that is needed at the initial stages of understanding a mathematical concept.",10,mtms2009-12-274a,,
"Therefore, experimenting with infinite sequences and their sums could be both interesting and mathematically rewarding for advanced, younger students. My group of students consisted of twenty mathematically advanced fifth graders from two regular classes who met as a separate group in their school on a weekly basis. By introducing the never-ending sums activity to my students, I wanted to achieve several goals: •	 Build	on	students’	curiosity	about	 infinity and acquaint them with issues relating to infinite sequences and their sums.",11,mtms2009-12-274a,,
•	 Present	an	activity	to	students	that	 requires working on the integration of domains and using various representations of a mathematical concept.,12,mtms2009-12-274a,,

The Third and Fourth Stories,40,mtms2009-12-274a,,
"The third story’s context (see fig. 1c) is similar to that of the first. This time, however, a boy eats parts of a cake according	to	the	“Sum	of	Quarters”:	1/4,	 1/16, 1/64, . . . . Next, the students were required to write their own “Story of Quarters”	(see	fig. 2). The drawings that accompany these stories represent the “Sum	of	Quarters”	in	two	different	ways.

Very Large and Very Small Numbers,45,mtms2009-12-274a,,
"In an introductory class discussion, I asked for examples of very large numbers. Some of the answers given were “70 billion 530 thousands,” “a googol,” and “infinity.” We discussed the difference between a very large number and infinity. We concluded that “70 billion 530 thousands” is indeed a very large number, whereas infinity is a concept (and not a number) that relates to sequences or quantities that cannot be bounded by any finite number or measure.",46,mtms2009-12-274a,,
"Next, I asked for examples of  very small positive numbers. Some of the examples were “one billionth,” “1 over 70 billion 530 thousands,” “1 over something that is very large,” and “epsilon.” I was pleased by some students’ ability to make connections and use the inverses of the large numbers mentioned before as examples of very small numbers. Although not perfectly applicable, I was also amused by the example of epsilon, a concept discussed in calculus classes regarding very small numbers and approaching limits; it elicited the image of a parent attempting to share with an elevenyear-old some memories from his or her calculus class.  “The Sum of Halves”",47,mtms2009-12-274a,,
"The students’ work on the first two stories was followed by an extensive discussion about the properties of the “Sum of Halves.” On the one hand, the students felt that Ronnie and Joe got increasingly closer to covering the whole (cake or distance); on the other hand, if they followed the pattern, they would never finish their task. On the basis of the second story, the students noted that at each stage, the distance covered by the boy can be viewed either as one-half the distance covered in the stage before or as onehalf the distance that remained to complete the whole distance.",48,mtms2009-12-274a,,
"Using this observation, I asked ",49,mtms2009-12-274a,,
Fig. 3 Students	can	draw	conclusions	about	infinite	sums	by	comparing	the	first	five	 terms	of	the	“sum	of	quarters”	and	the	“sum	of	halves.”,50,mtms2009-12-274a,,

(At the tenth stage, the boy covered 1/1024, which will also be the part that remains to complete the journey. As a result, Joe covered at this point 1023/1024 of the whole distance.) Next, we had a very intense debate about whether the “Sum of Halves”	can or cannot reach the result of 1. The students knew that, from a mathematical point of view, the sum will never reach 1, but they realized that in the real world Ronnie and Joe will eventually get their task completed as a whole.  the conflict between our intuitions, based on experiences in a limited real-life environment, and the mathematical meanings of stories, based on infinite sequences. ",52,mtms2009-12-274a,,
"These seemingly real-life stories raise expectations for clearly defined results (Ronnie will finish her cake; Joe will reach his friend’s house); however, mathematically we realize that the tasks cannot be completed. I raised the possibility that never-ending sums cannot have results that we are used to finding when we solve regular exercises. We need two different sets of rules: ",53,mtms2009-12-274a,,
"Some of the comments on the two  1.  One rule is for the limited real-life  stories were as follows:  environment.  •	 “Finally	Ronnie	will	get	to	atoms,	 and she won’t be able to cut the cake.”  •	 “At	a	certain	point,	Ronnie	will	not	 be able to restrain herself and will eat the whole cake.”  •	 “It	seems	as	if	Joe	will	reach	the	 bell of his friend’s home, but he will not be able to ring it.”  •	 “These	stories	remind	me	of	a	",54,mtms2009-12-274a,,
"Greek guy, but I don’t remember his name.” ",55,mtms2009-12-274a,,
I remarked that the name of the Greek guy was Zeno and that for hundreds of years many mathematicians and philosophers tried to settle  2.  Another rule is for the mathematical worlds that allow for infinite processes and quantities. ,56,mtms2009-12-274a,,
"I also mentioned that to work with infinite sums that get increasingly closer to a number but do not reach it, mathematicians defined the notion of a limit.",57,mtms2009-12-274a,,
“The Sum of Quarters”,58,mtms2009-12-274a,,
"In the discussion that followed the students’ work on the third and fourth stories, I asked them to compare the first	five	fractions	in	the	“Sum	of	Quarters” and the first ten fractions in the “Sum of Halves,” as shown in figure 3. The students noted the following: •	 “Both	sums	end	with	the	same	 term.” •	 “The	first	sum	is	composed	of	 every other fraction of the second.” •	 “The	number	of	fractions	in	the	 first sum is half that of the second.”",59,mtms2009-12-274a,,
"My next question was this: “Is the  number of fractions in the first sum half that of the second for the neverending sums as well?” As expected, most of the students used their reallife common sense in dealing with situations that relate to infinity and agreed that this was true. They argued that similarly to the (finite) sums that we wrote, the quantities of fractions in the two never-ending sums will “go on and behave the same way,” that is, the	“Sum	of	Quarters”	will	have	half	as	 many fractions as the “Sum of Halves.” ",60,mtms2009-12-274a,,
"I continued with the following  story:   Let us suppose that the fractions of the two sums decided to take a friendly walk. The first fraction of each sum joined hands, and they started their walk. So did the second fractions of each of the two sums, the third fractions, the fourth fractions, and so on. My question to you is this: Are	there	any	fractions	 that	will	have	to	walk	without	a	 matching	friend	from	the	other	sum? ",61,mtms2009-12-274a,,
"The students agreed that each fraction will find a partner, and I referred them to their claim that the never-ending “Sum of Halves” has only half the fractions	of	the	“Sum	of	Quarters.”	I	",62,mtms2009-12-274a,,
Zeno’s Paradox of  achilles and the tortoise,63,mtms2009-12-274a,,
"Achilles	is	in	a	footrace	with	a	tortoise.	Achilles	gives	the	tortoise	a	head	 start	of	100	feet.	If	we	assume	that	each	runner	starts	running	at	some	 constant	speed	(one	very	fast	and	one	very	slow),	then	after	some	time,	",64,mtms2009-12-274a,,
"Achilles	will	have	run	100	feet,	bringing	him	to	the	tortoise’s	starting	point.	",65,mtms2009-12-274a,,
"During	this	time,	the	tortoise	has	run	a	much	shorter	distance,	for	example,	 10 feet. It will then take Achilles some additional time to run that distance, in	which	time	the	tortoise	will	have	advanced	farther.	More	time	will	then	 be	needed	to	reach	this	third	point,	while	the	tortoise	moves	ahead.	Thus,	 whenever	Achilles	reaches	some	point	where	the	tortoise	has	been,	he	still	 has	farther	to	go.	Therefore,	because	there	are	an	infinite	number	of	points	 that	Achilles	must	reach	where	the	tortoise	has	already	been,	he	can	never	 overtake	the	tortoise.",66,mtms2009-12-274a,,
"This paradox can be mathematically (but not necessarily philosophically)  settled	by	noting	that	as	the	distance	decreases,	the	time	needed	to	cover	those	 distances	also	decreases.	Thus,	the	time	needed	to	cover	each	distance	becomes	 increasingly	smaller,	and	the	total	time	for	the	whole	event	is	bounded.",67,mtms2009-12-274a,,
"assume that as a result of this story, some students realized the difficulty of arguing about infinite sums by using our experience from a finite world.",68,mtms2009-12-274a,,
"The next issue was finding the number that is approached by the “Sum	of	Quarters.”	Since	students’	 opinions varied, I initiated a quick vote that revealed these results:  •	 About	one-half	the	class	voted	for	1.",69,mtms2009-12-274a,,
•	 About	one-third	voted	for	1/2.	 •	 Only	three	students	voted	for	the	 correct answer of 1/3. ,70,mtms2009-12-274a,,
"I asked representatives from each group to justify their decision. Those who chose 1 claimed that, as with the first two stories, the third and the fourth stories lead to covering the whole. The second group claimed that since the “Sum of Halves” approaches 1	and	the	“Sum	of	Quarters”	is	half	 the “Sum of Halves,” the first will  ",71,mtms2009-12-274a,,
"The students knew, from a mathematical point of view, that the sum will never  reach 1, but they realized that in the  real world the task will eventually  get completed.  approach 1/2. Finally, those who believed the sum was 1/3 convinced the others by using the drawing that represented	the	“Sum	of	Quarters”	as	being	 a sequence of trapezoids (see fig. 2).",72,mtms2009-12-274a,,
goals and aFterthoughts,73,mtms2009-12-274a,,
"My advanced fifth graders’ work on the activity prompted me to reexamine my initial goals, which I share below.",74,mtms2009-12-274a,,
"1.	Build	on	students’	curiosity	about	 infinity	and	acquaint	them	at	an	early	 stage	with	issues	relating	to	infinite	 sequences	and	their	sums. Educators and researchers agree that the initial stage of learning any	mathematical concept should be based on previously acquired knowledge and intuitions. However, in learning advanced mathematical concepts, the stage at which students can informally and intuitively encounter mathematical concepts is sometimes bypassed. Unfortunately, students must begin with a formal presentation of definitions and properties. ",75,mtms2009-12-274a,,
"In this particular case, I was quite  satisfied with the interesting and meaningful class discussions on the concept of infinite sums at such an early stage. However, I found some parts of the class discussion to be unfocused or even confusing. I also felt that some of the students were not convinced by the argument for  the need to think about infinity differently than we think about finite quantities in the context of real-life environmental issues.  2.	Have	students	work	on	an	activity	 that	requires	an	integration	of	domains. I was surprised by the wide range of connections made by the students in their work on the activity and in the following discussions. The connections made were both within mathematics (very large and very small numbers, fractions, sequences, and finite and infinite sums) and between mathematics and other domains (history of mathematics, philosophy, and the students’ daily environment).",76,mtms2009-12-274a,,
"3.	Have	students	work	on	an	activity	 that	requires	the	use	of	various	representations	of	a	mathematical	concept. In the activity discussed here, the concepts of infinite sequences and sums are presented in a wide variety of representations: verbal (stories), graphical (drawings, number line), and numerical (fraction sums). The students made frequent transitions among these representations and used them in effective and meaningful ways. Researchers report about students’ difficulties in learning the concepts of infinity and infinite sums (see, for example, Tall 1992). I found  that the context of stories and graphical representations of never-ending sums can be a particularly appropriate early encounter with this advanced mathematical concept.",77,mtms2009-12-274a,,
"4.	Note	the	cognitive	and	affective	 needs	of	advanced	students	by	presenting	 them	with	challenging,	interesting,	and	 surprising	problems. Both group work and class discussions were particularly lively. The students’ reactions revealed enjoyment, curiosity, and strong personal involvement. I attribute these attitudes to the fact that both the activity and class discussions required students to solve unknown problems, make connections among a variety of domains, and apply their knowledge and common sense in new ways.",78,mtms2009-12-274a,,
"In general, the lesson about neverending sums led me to conclude that the students’ interest, their ability to relate to a wide variety of domains and representations, and the opportunity to have a mathematically significant experience outweighed the doubts, the unanswered questions, and the unsettled issues that arise in more advanced mathematics.",79,mtms2009-12-274a,,
