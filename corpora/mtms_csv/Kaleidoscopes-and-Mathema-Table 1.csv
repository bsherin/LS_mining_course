12,Kaleidoscopes and Mathematics: An Elegant Connection,"Catherine M. Miller       iImages in a kaleidoscope can be  dazzlingly stunning. The beauty of the image depends on its symmetry. However, some kaleidoscopes do not have perfectly symmetric images. The image on the top in figure 1 is from an imperfect kaleidoscope. Although the image is still attractive, its symmetry is fractured. The image on the bottom in figure 1 is mathematically better in that the symmetry is evident throughout the design.",12,Kaleidoscopes and Mathematics: An Elegant Connection
13,Kaleidoscopes and Mathematics: An Elegant Connection,"The distinction between these two images has become the motivation for a geometry project for middle school mathematics classes to explore mirror and rotational symmetries. Analyzing the mirror arrangements of kaleidoscopes  connects symmetry to regular polygons. When doing this project, students investigate this question: What dihedral angles between pairs of mirrors in a kaleidoscope result in perfectly symmetric images? The unit culminates with students building their own kaleidoscopes.

16,Kaleidoscopes and Mathematics: An Elegant Connection,"Students need to be familiar with regular polygons, specifically, the measurements of central and vertex angles and reflectional symmetry. This project can be completed as part of a larger unit, or it can serve as an application of the included geometric concepts. Begin by analyzing the images in several kaleidoscopes. First, look at the designs created in each kaleidoscope and appreciate the overall beauty. After becoming familiar with the images, encourage students to look more closely at the designs. Some have images that are a bit fractured, showing where the symmetry is imperfect. Now the students can classify the kaleidoscopes into two categories, using the symmetric quality of the images. Then, challenge them to make a conjecture about the construction of the kaleidoscopes as it relates to the mathematical perfection of the images. ",16,Kaleidoscopes and Mathematics: An Elegant Connection
17,Kaleidoscopes and Mathematics: An Elegant Connection,"During this conversation, tell students that most kaleidoscopes have three mirrors, forming a baseless triangular prism within the kaleidoscope’s tube. Bring mirrors to class (plastic mirrors can be found in most catalogs of manipulatives) that have been taped together in pairs. Using these “hinged mirrors,” have students, working in groups, play with reflections. (See activity 1 for the handout describing this part of the activity.) When the hinged mirrors are placed on a line, they can be opened and closed to form regular polygons in the reflections. Since these are nicely symmetric shapes, we say that the angle between the mirrors is a “good kaleidoscope angle.” Students can use protractors or what they know about the central angles of regular polygons to find these measurements. ",17,Kaleidoscopes and Mathematics: An Elegant Connection
18,Kaleidoscopes and Mathematics: An Elegant Connection,"Using a paper clip or other small object, recreate the star-like patterns seen in kaleidoscopes. By placing the paper clip against one mirror, the reflections become more interesting. In this portion of the exploration, use the good kaleidoscope angles previously identified. In some cases, the paper clip is always associated with its image, and a star-like pattern is created. In other cases, there is a lonely paper clip. That is, one image of the paper clip does not have a partner and the star pattern is imperfect. This is not a very good kaleidoscope angle. Returning to our list of good kaleidoscope angles, we reclassify some to be “very good kaleidoscope angles.” ",18,Kaleidoscopes and Mathematics: An Elegant Connection
19,Kaleidoscopes and Mathematics: An Elegant Connection,"Taking the mathematics of these two activities to different levels will depend on your students. In some instances, merely finding the patterns and seeing that they create the desired images is sufficient. In other classes, challenge the students to generalize their findings and defend their conjectures. For example, have them find an algebraic formula that ",19,Kaleidoscopes and Mathematics: An Elegant Connection

21,Kaleidoscopes and Mathematics: An Elegant Connection,"(a) An imperfect image (b) A symmetrical image represents all very good kaleidoscope angles that they have found. Also, look at and explain why the images formed by the hinged mirrors behave as they do. Using diagrams to analyze the symmetry across intersecting lines (the hinged mirror), students  can understand the formation of the images. Many extensions are possible, depending on your students’ mathematical backgrounds. For more extensions, look at the section on kaleidoscopes in Geometry by Discovery (Gay 1998).",21,Kaleidoscopes and Mathematics: An Elegant Connection
22,Kaleidoscopes and Mathematics: An Elegant Connection,"Once all the very good  kaleidoscope angle measures have been found, prepare to build three mirror kaleidoscopes. To do this, students need to determine what angle combinations will result in perfectly symmetric kaleidoscopic images. Using what they know about the angles in a triangle, namely, that their measures sum to 180 degrees, students can find what sets of angles should be used. A table can be used to organize the data and discover the solutions. Students can also create a system of equations to help them find the sets of angles to use. (This is not a trivial system to solve algebraically; use an organized list to find the solutions.) There are only three sets of measures that result in mathematically perfect images: 30-60-90 degree, 4545-90 degree, and 60-60-60 degree triangles. We are ready to make our kaleidoscopes.",22,Kaleidoscopes and Mathematics: An Elegant Connection

24,Kaleidoscopes and Mathematics: An Elegant Connection,"Each kaleidoscope requires one  Pringles™ can and two plastic lids from the cans. You also need mat board and reflective Mylar™ (peel and stick is best, to avoid spraying glue to adhere the film) to make the mirrors for the kaleidoscopes. A collection of beads, scraps of colored plastic, and other items can be placed between the lids to reflect off the mirrors. Electrical tape is needed to connect the plastic lids containing the miscellaneous objects. The viewing hole is made by puncturing the metal end of the can using a hammer and a nail setter or awl. Complete directions for making the kaleidoscope are found in activity 2.",24,Kaleidoscopes and Mathematics: An Elegant Connection
25,Kaleidoscopes and Mathematics: An Elegant Connection,"Organize the classroom into  stations. Usually, only one station is needed for the hole punching. Cutting the mat board to form the mirrors takes the longest amount of time. For a class of 30 students, use three cutting stations to ensure that all students complete a kaleidoscope. ",25,Kaleidoscopes and Mathematics: An Elegant Connection
26,Kaleidoscopes and Mathematics: An Elegant Connection,"If needed, the mat boards can be cut ahead of time and sorted by dimensions. With this organization, all the kaleidoscopes can be completed in a 45-minute session. Once the students decide which kaleidoscope to make (based on the angles between mirrors), they can select the boards they need. The Mylar scratches easily and is marred by oil from hands. Knowing this, instruct students to work carefully when applying the Mylar to their boards. The sizes of the boards are such that, when slipped into the Pringles cans, they support one another, forming the triangular prism. This is another opportunity for mathematics exploration, if so desired. Since the Mylar is expensive, some teachers have used the short, snack-sized Pringles cans instead, which result in functioning kaleidoscopes. However, note that the image is not quite as clear compared with the taller cans.",26,Kaleidoscopes and Mathematics: An Elegant Connection
27,Kaleidoscopes and Mathematics: An Elegant Connection,"Once the kaleidoscopes are  complete, have students view all their creations. Challenge them to determine the angles used between the boards based on the images they see. This leads them to study the symmetry of each kaleidoscope and look for patterns. They can easily check their guesses by taking the lids off the cans. ",27,Kaleidoscopes and Mathematics: An Elegant Connection
28,Kaleidoscopes and Mathematics: An Elegant Connection,"When preparing for the building  process, there are more opportunities for students to apply mathematics. Students can calculate how much mat board, Mylar, and electrical tape will be needed to complete all the kaleidoscopes, addressing the various Common Core’s standards about measurement (CCSSI 2010). Give students information about the sizes that these materials come in and ask students to estimate how many units of each are needed. Students can also be asked to calculate the price of all the kaleidoscopes and the cost per kaleidoscope. This provides a nice review of many concepts learned at other times in middle school mathematical courses. ",28,Kaleidoscopes and Mathematics: An Elegant Connection

30,Kaleidoscopes and Mathematics: An Elegant Connection,"Once students have completed their kaleidoscopes, bring the collection used to launch the project back to class. Analyze the images again to identify the mathematically inaccurate kaleidoscopes. Even though the containers of students’ kaleidoscopes are not elaborate, the images resulting from their mirror arrangements are quite good. Allow students to celebrate their successes and revel in the beauty of the design. Mathematicians often seek perfection when proving the universal truth of their discoveries. As a community, students may better understand this quest. ",30,Kaleidoscopes and Mathematics: An Elegant Connection
