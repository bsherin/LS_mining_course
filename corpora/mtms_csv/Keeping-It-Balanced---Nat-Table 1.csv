3,Keeping It Balanced - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"2. Individuals “balance their books” when they compare their bank statement with the checkbook register they maintain. Suppose that your bank statement shows you have $913.00 in your account, but your checkbook register (see below) shows that you have $1,013.00.",,

30,Keeping It Balanced - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,1. Sample answer: Balancing the books involves finding the sum of all the credits and debits and making sure that there are no errors in the bookkeeping.,,
31,Keeping It Balanced - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"2.   a. The amount of error is $1,013.00 – $913.00, or $100.00. There is $100.00 less in the account than what is shown in the checkbook register.",,
32,Keeping It Balanced - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,b. The corrections are shown in red in table 1.,,
33,Keeping It Balanced - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
34,Keeping It Balanced - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,3. Sample answers: There is an equivalence relation between the value on the left-hand side and the value on the right-hand side. The value on the left side is the same as that on the right. The two sides of the equation are balanced. Note that some students believe that the equals sign separates the problem from the solution. Encourage those students to think of the sign as meaning equality and balance. Problem 4 is designed to encourage relational thinking about the equals sign.,,

36,Keeping It Balanced - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"5. Sample answer: In each case, we are looking for a number that will balance the number sentence. For example, in question 4a, we are looking for the number that when added to 6.5 will produce 14.",,
37,Keeping It Balanced - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,6.  a. 2 units. The scales can be represented with the equation 3(3) = 3 + 3x; the equation can be solved for the value of x: 9 = 3 + 3x; 3x = 6; x = 2.,,
38,Keeping It Balanced - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,b. 1 unit. The scales can be represented with the equation 3(2) + 2(2) = 3(3) + y. Solving for y: 6 + 4 = 9 + y; 1 = y.,,
39,Keeping It Balanced - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,c. 6 units. The scales can be represented with the equation 2(2) + z = 2(2) + 3(1) + 3. Solving for z: 4 + z = 4 + 3 + 3; z = 6.,,
40,Keeping It Balanced - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,7.  Box A: 39 kg; box B: 87 kg; box C: 18 kg,,
41,Keeping It Balanced - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Sample solution: To find the mass of box C, subtract the total mass of the two boxes on the first scale (126 kg) from the total mass of the three boxes on the third scale (144 kg): 144 – 126 = 18, so the mass of box C is 18 kg. To find the mass of box A, subtract 18 from the total mass of the two boxes on the second scale: 57 – 18 = 39, so the mass of box A is 39 kg. To find the mass of box B, subtract 39 from the total mass of the two boxes on the first scale: 126 – 39 = 87, so the mass of box B is 87 kg. To check, find the sum of the three masses and compare with the total mass on the third scale: 39 + 87 + 18 = 144.",,
42,Keeping It Balanced - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,FIELD-TEST COMMENTS,,
43,Keeping It Balanced - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I used the checkbook register in this Cartoon Corner as an exit ticket for my sixth graders. We were studying financial literacy and were practicing writing checks and balancing a check register, with multiple examples of deposits and withdrawals. The students enjoyed looking for the error in the check register, which was almost like a game. We discussed the questions as a group, and many unique answers were given. One student suggested that the person should pay more attention when writing things down in the register and be careful not to miss anything. It was acknowledged that sometimes if you are in a hurry, you make mistakes. One student used the vocabulary outstanding check, pointing out that maybe the check had not been processed yet, which was perhaps where the error came from.",,

47,Keeping It Balanced - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,I presented “Keeping It Balanced” to both my prealgebra and algebra students. The comic was used as a way to help review for a standardized test that the students were soon to complete. It was a good reminder of how to solve single-step and multi-step equations. The students enjoyed the fun that a comic brought to class.,,
48,Keeping It Balanced - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"One of the biggest things I noticed while working on the comic was that the students had no idea how to balance a checkbook or even what a checkbook register was. As you can imagine, this situation brought on a whole round of questions itself. However, once the students realized that the process was a way to track money, their interest increased tenfold. As a teacher, I thought that this comic allowed students to review and practice a skill in a real-life situation while bringing excitement to their learning and reviewing of solving, or balancing, equations.",,

52,Keeping It Balanced - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Balancing books was a phrase unfamiliar to my sixth-grade prealgebra students, yet they actually perform this task twice a month! Throughout the year, my students participate in a project I call Reality Check. They select a career, research a university to attend, compute the cost of that education, and work as though they are employed in that field. Twice a month, they deposit their net pay and pay bills, ranging from rent and electricity to student loans and car insurance. This Cartoon Corner activity was a natural extension.",,
53,Keeping It Balanced - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Students completed these questions independently and discussed solutions and strategies in small groups, often comparing the “balancing act” to science activities using the triple beam balance. They enjoyed the problem-solving component.",,

57,Keeping It Balanced - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I used this activity with sixth-grade students in late spring. They worked individually and were not allowed to use calculators. Reading the students’ answers provided some interesting feedback for me as we approached the end of our school year. Many of the students had no idea how to define “balance their books.” Almost all used the word “balance,” and referred to balancing a checkbook, but they did not define “balancing” in terms of adding credits and subtracting debits. During a class discussion, several students told me that since their parents use a computer program to keep monetary records, they had no idea how to do this.",,
58,Keeping It Balanced - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Reflecting on their answers about the checkbook reinforced concerns I have regarding financial literacy and what we are teaching our students. During our decimal unit, we spent time on a few lessons on similar problems. On the basis of students’ answers to these questions, I can see that this topic needed to be revisited.",,
59,Keeping It Balanced - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I remember as a child watching one of my parents go through the bank statement and mark off all the transactions to be sure everything was correct. I do not think students of today see their parents do the same work, now on the computer, that my parents did with paper and a calculator. In fact, many students mainly see that their parents use debit or credit cards, rarely using cash or writing a check. Many students think that because their parents use a computer to keep track of bills that the computer does all the work for them. They have not yet grasped the fact that the person entering the data determines whether a transaction is added to or subtracted from the existing balance.",,
60,Keeping It Balanced - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Overall, I feel that my students have limited knowledge of bank accounts and how to balance them.",,
