A Geometric Approach to Solving Rate Problems,2,mtms2010-12-302a,,
"The proportional reasoning required to solve rate problems can cause difficulty for many students. However, understanding how to solve problems of this type is vital as students transition from arithmetic to algebra. A guided-discovery approach to modeling these problems using pattern blocks can help students appreciate the quantities involved and the relationships between them. ",3,mtms2010-12-302a,,
"Producing an area model with pattern blocks provides a visual, concrete setting for student explorations. This area model also contains the necessary mathematical structure so that students can attain a deep, comprehensive understanding. ",4,mtms2010-12-302a,,

"Basic pattern-block sets include  yellow hexagons, red trapezoids, blue rhombi, and green equilateral triangles (see fig. 1a). When they are used to explore computations involving fractions, two additional pattern-block shapes are helpful, namely, brown right trapezoids and purple right triangles, which can be purchased in another set. These additional pattern block pieces are shown in figure 1b and are needed for many of the problems in the activity sheets. ",6,mtms2010-12-302a,,
"Although other conventions are  possible, we use the yellow hexagon as the unit, or whole. Two red trapezoids exactly cover one yellow hexagon, so the red trapezoid has a value of onehalf. Figure 2 shows the fractional quantities in relation to one whole.",7,mtms2010-12-302a,,

We use the following introductory example in a Modeling with Algebra course. The students were primarily preservice early-childhood and middle-grades education majors.   Example 1: Joe and Matt start a landscaping business together. Homes in their neighborhood have similarly sized lawns. Joe can typically mow a lawn and trim all  the shrubs in 3 hours. Matt usually needs 2 hours to do the same job. They decide to work together on 5 lawns. How long will it take them to finish?,9,mtms2010-12-302a,,
"We develop the example using two tasks. For the first task, we ask students, “Can you find a way to model the problem?” Within about ten minutes, as the instructor moves around the room offering feedback, many groups are able to produce correct, primitive models using the pattern blocks, some of which are robust enough to solve the problem. We have one or two groups share their models, and we lead the class in a discussion of what the quantities represent.",10,mtms2010-12-302a,,
"We see many acceptable formulations. Most students view the yellow hexagon (one whole) as one unit of work, a completed lawn. They exchange the yellow hexagons for red trapezoids and blue rhombi and arrange the work done per hour in a column format. Figure 3 models the facts that Joe can mow 1/3 of a lawn each hour and that Matt can mow 1/2 of a lawn each hour.",11,mtms2010-12-302a,,
"We take time to discuss the model and make sure students understand it.

Fig. 2 The yellow hexagon is the whole against which all other pieces can be compared.,17,mtms2010-12-302a,,
Fig. 3 The Joe and Matt lawn problem’s rates can be modeled with fraction pattern blocks.,18,mtms2010-12-302a,,
How long will it take the two boys to complete 5 lawns if they work together?,19,mtms2010-12-302a,,
"Most students can readily fi nd an answer, although approaches will vary. One popular and straightforward solution is to fi ll up several more “hour columns” with red trapezoids and blue rhombi. After several columns are created, students begin counting the whole lawns, one for each pair of red trapezoids and one for each three blue rhombi. Figure 4 shows the combined rate of work for Joe and Matt. This is a typical solution path that our students follow to determine the number of time periods needed to fi nish 5 lawns.",20,mtms2010-12-302a,,
"Students begin to visualize the rate problems in terms of work units, both individual and collective, and the unit of time required. Other approaches also work well. Students can make trades and exchanges so that the total work accomplished each hour by the two boys is easier to see. For example, in 1 of the 6 time periods, students can trade 3 green triangles (1/6) for 1 red trapezoid (1/2), and 2 green triangles for 1 blue rhombus (1/3). They can then use the 5 green pieces to fi ll in the holes in each of the other 5 time periods. This approach helps students recognize that the total work done in each time period is 5/6 of a lawn. We fi nd it valuable to have at least two different correct approaches demonstrated by students.",21,mtms2010-12-302a,,
"Once students have begun to understand the process, we give several more problems, such as those shown on activity sheet 1. We discourage pencil-and-paper solutions initially. In our experience, transitioning to an algebraic representation too early causes diffi culty. We walk around the room helping students who are struggling. After all groups have completed an additional two problems, we begin a guided discussion of how ",22,mtms2010-12-302a,,
Fig. 4 This typical solution path shows completed lawns that are composed of trapezoids (1/3 of a unit each) and rhombi (1/2 of a unit each).,23,mtms2010-12-302a,,
Fig. 5 The balloon problem duplicates the work done earlier with Joe and Matt’s lawn.,24,mtms2010-12-302a,,
to formalize the process. This typically happens about an hour into the introductory lesson.,25,mtms2010-12-302a,,
ForMaliZing the representations,26,mtms2010-12-302a,,
"Formalization proceeds in two stages. We fi rst ask our students to express the needed quantities symbolically. If not offered by a student, we suggest subscripted notation for the rates. For the Joe and Matt lawn problem, we would write: an an an an an rd rd",27,mtms2010-12-302a,,
Md rd rd,28,mtms2010-12-302a,,
"In this display, rJ represents Joe’s rate of work per hour and rM represents Matt’s. Therefore, the total rate of work per hour for the team is given by: r+",29,mtms2010-12-302a,,
M+ r+ + =+ = =,30,mtms2010-12-302a,,
TrTr,31,mtms2010-12-302a,,
The next question is: “How many 5/6 are required to make up 5 units?” ,32,mtms2010-12-302a,,
"We discourage a leap to division at this point. Instead, we prefer that students think multiplicatively at fi rst, using the pattern blocks and verbal reasoning: “6 × 5/6 = 5, so the boys will fi nish mowing 5 lawns in 6 hours.” A full solution at this point requires a correct pattern-block model for the problem, the individual and team rates of work, and the answer to the problem. No algebraic manipulations are done with pencil and paper. The quantities are noted as the pattern-block models evolve into a solution. ",33,mtms2010-12-302a,,
"The second stage of formalization requires students to extend the model. The following question moves students in this direction:  Example 2: Maria and Dusti are decorating the gym with helium balloons. Maria can infl ate and tie off 2 balloons every 3 minutes. Dusti requires 2 minutes to fi nish 1 balloon. Working together, how long will it take them to complete a batch of 35 balloons? ",34,mtms2010-12-302a,,
"The work that must be done to complete example 2 is more extensive, so students often solve a partial problem. The combined rate of work completed is 1 1 /6 balloons per minute (see fi g. 5). Students generally make enough time-period columns to get a whole number of balloons, then multiply. They fi nd that 6 minutes of teamwork produces 7 balloons. Since 35 ÷ 7 = 5, our students reason correctly that 5 periods of 6 minutes each, or 30 minutes total, will be needed. The limitation of moving dozens of patterns blocks around encourages sound proportional reasoning to speed up the process. ",35,mtms2010-12-302a,,
"Other extensions include fractional answers, questions where students must infer that the total work accomplished is 1 whole unit, and problems that resist the pattern-block model. Fractional answers to rate problems encourage  full understanding of the quantities represented and a careful cataloguing of the units of time. Although the difficulty increases significantly, reliance on the model tends to produce more accurate solutions. Algebraic solutions are required for the final two problems on activity sheet 2 and the final assessment question (solutions are online at www.nctm.org/mtms).  discussion and classrooM practice",36,mtms2010-12-302a,,
We have used these activities with preservice and in-service K–8 teachers. We have had vicarious experience with in-service teachers who have used these units with their classes. One special education class of seventh-grade and eighth-grade students found the models particularly helpful. ,37,mtms2010-12-302a,,
"In a middle-grades classroom, more  time will likely be needed to explore this topic than in our college classroom setting, perhaps several days. We feel that this investment of time will be worthwhile, given the rich understanding that can arise.",38,mtms2010-12-302a,,
"Our students begin the unit already  familiar with pattern blocks, having worked with units on how to teach fraction arithmetic with pattern-block models. They have completed exercises with addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of fractional and mixed-number quantities. Classes that have not used pattern blocks in these settings will likely need to briefly explore the quantities expressed by the blocks and practice making the trades and the exchanges that are necessary for the four basic operations. In classrooms where prior fraction activities have used pattern-block models, this unit would require only minimal review.",39,mtms2010-12-302a,,
"Our students often fail to read carefully. We have written the rates backward on several problems to help their reasoning about rates develop. For example, we normally say that David  eats 3 candy bars every 2 days. Turning it around, we say that in 2 days David eats 3 candy bars. This transposition causes some difficulties with students who skip too quickly to making a fraction with the blocks, before determining the “work per time.”",40,mtms2010-12-302a,,
"Pattern blocks, like most area  models, lend themselves to the repeated-addition representation for multiplication and the equal-groups representation for division. These two formulations encourage a sequential approach to working through rate problems in that they focus on the units of time and work completed. This process promotes a deeper understanding of proportional reasoning.",41,mtms2010-12-302a,,
"The final two problems that are on  activity sheet 2 resist pattern-block models. After experiencing the guideddiscovery lessons, our students are able to transition successfully to penciland-paper methods, and they organize their work using the same method they learned with pattern blocks. For some groups, additional guidance is necessary to help them complete this transition. In the middle-grades classroom, we anticipate that more group discussions and demonstrations from classmates would be helpful.",42,mtms2010-12-302a,,
"Through our work with in-service teachers, we have found that some students wish to have the yellow hexagon represent a unit of time, rather than a unit of work. This is a valuable and correct approach, but the problems we have posed are resistant to it. For instance, with the balloon problem, we can easily model the quantity of  1 1/6 (balloons per minute) with pattern blocks, but not 6/7 (minutes per balloon). The general equation governing the relationships in rate problems is",43,mtms2010-12-302a,,
W = r × t.,44,mtms2010-12-302a,,
"The total work completed is the product of the rate of work (for the team) and units of time. Similar problems  with different quantities could engage the alternate formulation in precisely the same way as our unit, with similar learning gains expected. Investigations involving pattern blocks require very careful posing and testing of problems and solution paths to ensure that the quantities needed at each stage of the solution can be represented with the pieces available.",45,mtms2010-12-302a,,
"Activity sheets 1 and 2 scaffold the  investigation from simple problems with whole-unit answers to various extensions. They then finish with problems that require a pencil-and-paper approach. Activity sheet 3 (online) is a unit assessment that follows a similar development. The first three problems can be modeled and solved with pattern blocks. Two are simple; one is more advanced. We do not require that our students produce equations to get full credit on these problems, although they must use correct mathematical arguments that typically include some mathematical symbols and some reference to the pattern blocks. The fourth problem requires a pencil-and-paper approach. We use it to assess students’ understanding of the formal solution.",46,mtms2010-12-302a,,
