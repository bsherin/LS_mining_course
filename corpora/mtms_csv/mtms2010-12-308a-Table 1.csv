"Faster isn’t smarter: Messages about Math, teaching, and  learning in the twenty-First  century",2,mtms2010-12-308a,,
"Cathy L. Seeley, 2009. 272 pp., $24.95 paper. ISBN 978‑1‑ 935099‑03‑1. Math Solutions;  www.mathsolutions.com.",3,mtms2010-12-308a,,
"A collection of messages about issues surrounding mathematics education, this book is organized into three parts, with each part targeting a specific audience. Part 1 is directed at the general public, part 2 targets the local school community, and part 3 spotlights issues of concern to teachers. At the end of each message, Seeley provides a set of discussion questions, a list of further readings, and links to related messages. These links allow the reader to follow a thread of interest rather than necessarily read the book from beginning to end.",4,mtms2010-12-308a,,

"Prices on software, books, and materials are subject to change. Consult the suppliers for the current prices. The comments reflect the reviewers’ opinions and do not imply endorsement by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics.  service teachers are appalled at the idea of allowing a young student to struggle with a mathematics problem. Seeley’s message 17, “Constructive Struggling,” deals directly with this issue. As an assignment for my preservice teachers, I paired this message with the article “Learning to Share Equally,” by Drew Polly and Laura Ruble (in Teaching Children Mathematics, vol. 15, no. 9, May 2009, pp. 558–63), which presented an excellent example of teachers who allowed their students to struggle constructively. My students answered questions related to these readings and then participated in an online discussion. The resulting dialogue provided compelling evidence that Seeley’s message reached her intended goal of fueling discussion and reflection.",6,mtms2010-12-308a,,
"Reading Seeley’s persuasive words stimulates interest, thinking, debate, and understanding of the current issues within mathematics education. I recommend this book as a resource for anyone working to improve the teaching and learning of mathematics.",7,mtms2010-12-308a,,

Knowing and teaching  elementary Mathematics:  teachers’ Understanding of  Fundamental Mathematics in  china and the United states,10,mtms2010-12-308a,,
"Liping Ma, 2010. 198 pp.,  $34.95 paper. ISBN 978‑0‑ 415‑87384‑0. Routledge;  www.routledge.com.",11,mtms2010-12-308a,,
"Liping Ma’s book offers a mirror for preservice and in-service elementary (and possibly secondary) teachers to reflect on their mathematical, and  also pedagogical, knowledge by comparing the mathematical knowledge of Chinese with that of American teachers. ",12,mtms2010-12-308a,,
"Each chapter is dedicated to an elementary mathematics topic. In chapter 3, for instance, Ma analyzed participants’ real-world representations of division by fractions as well as teachers’ performance on the calculation. The goal was to reveal not only teachers’ mathematical knowledge but also their pedagogical knowledge. Ma’s careful analysis of Chinese teachers’ responses resulted in defining knowledge packages that Chinese teachers use to identify key pieces of information, related items, and potential interactions, thus exposing their curricular knowledge. Teacher educators and mathematics education researchers could use this book to frame their work.",13,mtms2010-12-308a,,
"Knowing and Teaching Elementary Mathematics offers valuable long-term guidance for teachers to attain a profound understanding of fundamental mathematics (PUFM). According to Ma, when a new teacher has a mathematical knowledge basis, he or she can obtain PUFM by studying teaching materials intensively, learning from students, communicating  with and learning from colleagues, and doing mathematics. Readers could use the idea of knowledge packages as concept maps for thinking about math content and the structure of the curriculum. This book may also encourage teachers to reflect on the relationships between their procedural and conceptual understanding of a topic, as well as their attitude toward mathematics, mathematical investigations, and teaching mathematics. This comparative analysis does  not draw a positive picture of American teachers. However, U.S. teachers should not read this book and feel under the gun, because there is much to gain from it. One of the hidden messages in this book is that it is never too late to learn more and grow mathematically and pedagogically.  S.

Includes an interactive whiteboard assessment game and downloadable educator’s guide. ISBN 1‑59753‑245‑2. Disney Educational Productions; www.DisneyEducation.com.",22,mtms2010-12-308a,,
"Mr. Nye has transformed himself from Bill Nye the Science Guy to Bill Nye the Math Guy. Nye has focused on middle school to the beginning ideas of algebra 1. Within one video, Nye has put together four short videos that range from solving equations with variables on both sides to analyzing linear functions.",23,mtms2010-12-308a,,
"Overall, the strengths and weaknesses are that the videos are very short. I was left wanting more. I wanted the video to give students time to practice while they were watching it. The interactive whiteboard is helpful, but even without it, a projected image on a large screen is still useful. The documentation that is embedded in the DVD is well done. Background information and extensions for each video are given, and each activity and video is classifi ed by not only NCTM’s Standards but also the language-arts counterpart.",24,mtms2010-12-308a,,
Bill Nye has done an Xcellent job starting his career in the math world. I look forward to more productions. This product will give a middle school teacher the opportunity to build from Nye’s information and engage students.,25,mtms2010-12-308a,,
