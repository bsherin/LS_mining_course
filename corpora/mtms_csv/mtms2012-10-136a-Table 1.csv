"To play the Penny Drop game, drop a penny from a To play the Penny Drop game, drop a penny from a height of 4 inches over a target. If more than 1/2 the penny height of 4 inches over a target. If more than 1/2 the penny is inside the circle labeled 50, you score 50 points. You need to add a 25-point region to the target so that the probability of scoring 25 points is double the probability of scoring 50 points. Experiment dropping pennies from a 4-inch height on your new target and record your results. Once you have decided on a region or regions, write an explanation of how and why you chose that area.  10 11 12 50",3,mtms2012-10-136a,,

"Colleen Donahue, an eighth-grade  teacher, sent in her students’ work and shared some reﬂ ections. These reﬂ ections provided wonderful insight into not only students’ thinking but also how a teacher presented the task and how it was used in the classroom.  stUdents’ WoRK",6,mtms2012-10-136a,,
"The solution we might expect to see, in which students created a target of concentric circles, was provided by three eighth-grade students, Carolyn, Luke, and Christopher, in Donahue’s advanced eighth-grade math class (see ﬁ g. 1). Using the diagram provided in the journal, they added grid lines throughout and calculated the area of the 50-point circle. Using the formula for the area, they then decided that the area of the larger ring needed to be twice the area of the inner circle. They then calculated the necessary radius for the larger concentric circle and drew it so that the ring had an area twice that of the given 50-point circle. ",7,mtms2012-10-136a,,
"Once they had completed their  drawing, they used it to run 20 trials of the Penny Drop game and recorded their data in a frequency table. Their experiment resulted in three 50-point drops, six 25-point drops, and eleven 0-point drops. From this information, they confi rmed that the probability of scoring 25 points was double the probability of scoring 50 points.",8,mtms2012-10-136a,,
"It is interesting to note that this was not the most common method of solution. More students simply realized that the area of the 25-point region needed to be twice as large as the 50-point region, so they created two additional same-size circles on the playing board (see fi gs. 2–4). Although each group of students followed the same idea, differences were evident in their work. ",9,mtms2012-10-136a,,
"In fi gure 2, Emily and Alex used the original diagram from the journal and immediately drew two additional circles in the upper-left and lowerright corners of the playing board. They also included a frequency table, indicating that they ran 15 trials of the Penny Drop game. Their trials confi rmed that they were twice as likely to score 25 points as 50 points.",10,mtms2012-10-136a,,

Fig. 2 Emily and Alex immediately drew two additional circles whose total area was simply twice that of one circle.,13,mtms2012-10-136a,,

"with graph paper and created their own 50-point circle and replicated two more circles for the 25-point regions. By drawing their own circles, they could choose the sizes and perhaps make them larger than those provided on the original diagram. Their work shows that they ran  20 trials. Although the experiment did not produce an exact 2:1 chance of scoring 25 points instead of  50 points, they realized that experimental probability does not always perfectly match theoretical probability and decided that the 5:3 ratio of  25 to 50 point scores was close enough to verify their thinking.

"Melanie and Saahit (see fig. 4) used the diagram from the journal and also added two same-size circles to the 50-point circle. However, there is evidence that they had tried to measure the radius of the 50-point circle. This measurement may have been used to calculate the actual area; however, they finally just drew two additional circles with approximately the same radius, side by side with the original circle.",16,mtms2012-10-136a,,

"When Donahue submitted her students’ work, she described how she administered the task and also specifically discussed Saahit’s and Melanie’s approach. Without this discussion, we would not have had evidence of these two students’ thinking. She wrote:",18,mtms2012-10-136a,,
"One group (Saahit and Melanie) started by trying to make a ring around the 50-point target. However, they struggled with calculating an area that was twice the original. They first made a ring that had a “width” equivalent to the radius of the original circle, and they created a ring that had a “width” equivalent to the diameter of the original circle. They thought that if they doubled  the dimensions that the area would double and, of course, it did not. At the end of a long struggle, they finally decided to put two circles on the graph equivalent to the first.",19,mtms2012-10-136a,,
"Clearly, this group wanted to produce the concentric circles that they associated with the idea of a target, but these students struggled to make an accurate rendition. Eventually, they decided to provide an easier form of an answer that would meet the problem requirements. Donahue recognized their struggle, but wanted to allow students to produce their own solutions without her help. Once she had collected the students’ final work, she then addressed the concept that was causing the group difficulty by scaffolding the task. She began by asking: ",20,mtms2012-10-136a,,
"If I have a circle with a radius  of 1.8 cm and an area of  10.1787 sq. cm., and I want to  create one circle that has double  that area, what would be the  radius of that circle? ",21,mtms2012-10-136a,,
She allowed students to work on that task until she had determined that all the students could arrive at the correct response. She then followed up with a final question: ,22,mtms2012-10-136a,,
How could I create a region shaped like a ring on the Penny Drop board that would meet the requirements? aUthoRs’ ReFlections,23,mtms2012-10-136a,,
"We appreciate Donahue’s willingness to share her students’ responses and struggles, as well as her work at scaffolding, or breaking down, the task to help the students struggling with the idea of doubling the area of a circle. She did an excellent job of administering the lesson, allowing the students to wrestle with the ideas, and following up with questions to support the development of further ",24,mtms2012-10-136a,,
Fig. 4 Melanie and Saahit’s work showed evidence of trying to measure the radius of the 50-point circle.,25,mtms2012-10-136a,,
"mathematical understanding. She did not tell the students what to do or help them figure out the radius of the needed concentric circle; instead, she asked questions that would help them discover this information on their own. ",26,mtms2012-10-136a,,
"If her scaffolding helped the  students be successful, why did we not scaffold the task? We have several reasons for presenting the task in the more open-ended format. First, we did not know exactly which ideas would cause students difficulty because every class of students is different. Second, scaffolding tends to lead students to a single solution or method and limits their thinking. For example, if Donahue would have asked questions before the students worked on the task, they would have likely all made concentric circles, since her final question led them toward the ring-shaped region. ",27,mtms2012-10-136a,,
"By posing the task first, and allowing students to solve it in any way they felt comfortable, the teacher  could see what students were thinking about the idea. At that point, areas or tasks could have been identified for further questions or used to help students build off their current thinking to further develop mathematical reasoning. ",28,mtms2012-10-136a,,
This scenario is what we envision in all mathematics classrooms when we pose our Solve It! tasks. The tasks provide not only opportunities for teachers and students to show us what they know and can do but also wonderful opportunities for teachers to discover gaps in student understanding. These gaps will allow teachers to ask additional thoughtprovoking questions so that students can develop the deeper understandings that they may be lacking.
