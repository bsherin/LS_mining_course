0,Using Moon Phases to Measure Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Cultures need to accurately record dates and times for various societal purposes, ranging from knowing when to plant crops to planning travel. In ancient times, the sun and moon were used as measurement devices because of the scientific understanding of the physical world at that time. Ancient timekeepers monitored celestial events and either used or discarded them, depending on whether or not they were useful as standard units.",,
1,Using Moon Phases to Measure Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Ancient authors wove concepts of time into culturally powerful works of fiction and nonfiction. The rhythm of existence has been meticulously related to time, as evidenced by narrative stories, descriptive timelines, or recurring cycles found in texts. Other examples include mathematically sound time measurement practices that have been found in writings attributed to ancient civilizations.",,
2,Using Moon Phases to Measure Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Our sixth-grade students understanding of time was enriched by a four-lesson sequence that integrated science (the constantly progressing lunar cycle), mathematics (what makes a good standard unit), and literacy (cultural events dependent on the time of year). This lesson sequence occurred during a summer camp attended by students who had an interest in science. The purpose of the week-long camp was to offer explorations in science, mathematics, and computer programming. Our team of university professors led the camp activities, which were developed in coordination with the students regular classroom teachers.",,
3,Using Moon Phases to Measure Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,LESSON 1: LUNAR PHASES,,
4,Using Moon Phases to Measure Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"To engage in the lessons, students needed to understand the lunar phases. Having a conceptual awareness that moonlight is reflected sunlight, rather than light generated by the moon, was a crucial entry point in understanding lunar phases. To gather information about the students knowledge of the lunar cycle, we opened the morning with this question, Why does the shape of the moon change? Responses included, Earth is rotating, and we can only see part of it and The sun is eclipsing it. To address these misconceptions, we produced a set of carefully painted spheres, as represented in figure 1.",,
5,Using Moon Phases to Measure Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We modeled the moon phases with eight spheres that were painted one-half black and one-half white, to represent the dark and light sides of the moon. These movable models showed relative locations of the sun, the moon, and Earth. Manipulating these materials demonstrated that sunlight was reflected and allowed the lesson to segue into a representation of the cyclic patterns of lunar phases as reflected sunlight.",,
6,Using Moon Phases to Measure Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"By directly manipulating the model, students recognized reasons for changes in the moons shape during a lunar cycle. We then asked students a series of follow-up questions, which were designed to foster their consideration of the moons appearance as being dependent on the viewers location. Students described the appearance of the moon as seen from Earth by coloring the eight moon phases, as shown in figure 2. These visual models helped students become aware of the reasons behind the changing appearance of the moon during different phases in the lunar cycle.",,
7,Using Moon Phases to Measure Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
8,Using Moon Phases to Measure Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"By describing the appearance of the moon in this way, we were able to name all the phases and label the spheres with their corresponding names, as shown in figure 3. To summarize this lesson, we explained that the regolith, the finely crushed rock-like powder on the moons surface, allows sunlight to be reflected. This reflective material allows the moon and its variety of shapes to be seen from Earth.",,
9,Using Moon Phases to Measure Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
10,Using Moon Phases to Measure Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"To prepare for the upcoming mathematics lesson, we needed students to recognize the difference between a month and a lunar cycle. We gave students a paper set of 12 months (from the current year) from which we had removed the months name. In small groups, the students sorted the months in order, using only the indicated moon phase images displayed on each day of each month (see fig. 4). Students relied on the pictures of the moon phases to help them order the months as soon as they grasped the nature of the mismatch between the phases of the moon and the 12-month calendar year. Our students studied the months and were ultimately able to state that the phases of the moon appeared to require between 29 and 30 days.",,
11,Using Moon Phases to Measure Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
12,Using Moon Phases to Measure Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We were pleased with this conjecture and confirmed that the sequence of moon phases is, indeed, a 29.5 day lunar cycle.",,
13,Using Moon Phases to Measure Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Students taped their yearlong calendars to the wall to keep the months in order. We asked them to (1) predict the lunar cycle for January of the next year, (2) highlight their birthdays on their calendars, and (3) predict the moon phase on their actual birth date (13 years earlier). After students made their predictions, they verified the moon phases on those dates by researching online (e.g., http://www.moonconnection.com/). Despite earlier statements that the moon phases did not match the months, many students were surprised to learn that the moons phase on their birth dates was not the same as the moon phase on their birthday of the current year.",,
14,Using Moon Phases to Measure Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,LESSON 2: STANDARD UNITS,,
15,Using Moon Phases to Measure Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Appropriately measuring time requires a conceptual awareness of characteristics that a time-based standard unit must possess. Knowing about standard units, making comparisons between standard units, and using a standard unit to record the size of an object are critical bits of information when learning to measure (Lehrer et al. 1999).",,
16,Using Moon Phases to Measure Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The second lesson opened with the question, Why was the moon phase not the same on your birthday this year as it had been on your actual birth date? to alert students that there would be differences in the moons appearance across different years. Answers ranged from A month isnt 29.5 days to Because of leap year. Our students were working to connect the previous activity to this one. Before proceeding, we wanted to help students develop shared language of these five measurement concepts:",,

21,Using Moon Phases to Measure Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,5. Infinite divisibility,,
22,Using Moon Phases to Measure Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We demonstrated these five concepts by measuring a pencil using various examples and nonexamples as well as a damaged ruler (see fig. 5). After seeing this demonstration, students were asked, What is working or not working in each of the situations [in fig. 5]?",,
23,Using Moon Phases to Measure Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
24,Using Moon Phases to Measure Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Students examined the ruler as a way to learn how to describe the concepts. We needed students to realize that when compared with the object being measured, the end of each unit was immediately next to the beginning of the next unit (i.e., end to end) and must be iterated without gaps or overlaps. The iterated unit must be the same size so that, when covered, the number of units inside the object represented the size of the object. One end of the object being measured must coincide with the front end (origin of measurement) of a standard unit.",,
25,Using Moon Phases to Measure Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"If the tool being used to measure an object was placed such that a number other than the measuring devices actual zero was aligned with the beginning of the object, much care must be taken to note the number associated with the size of the item being measured. Sometimes when measuring, a portion of the object might be leftover after using as many whole standard units as possible. For a standard unit to be as useful as possible, it should be able to break into parts, to precisely represent the size of the object.",,
26,Using Moon Phases to Measure Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"For our lessons, students needed to be able to identify conceptual difficulties with measuring time using lunar cycles. Students were given a blank calendar activity sheet, asked to find the approximate locations of the 8 moon phases, and answer the following four questions:",,
27,Using Moon Phases to Measure Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,1. How long is a lunar cycle?,,
28,Using Moon Phases to Measure Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,2. How long is a year?,,
29,Using Moon Phases to Measure Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,3. How many days are in 12 lunar cycles?,,
30,Using Moon Phases to Measure Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,4. How many days are in 13 lunar cycles?,,
31,Using Moon Phases to Measure Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"These questions seemed to help students organize their arguments and their thought processes. During the discussion, we asked them to connect the lunar cycle to the measurement concepts we discussed. Students said that the lunar cycle was a convenient unit of measure because it iterates, covers, and remains the same size. Each phase length is predictably 29.5 days (same size), there is always one set of moon phases after another (iteration), and there is no time during which the moon stops progressing through phases (coverage). Although the 2 days of a new moon caused a brief discussion about covering, the students agreed that the moon was there, progressing toward the beginning of the next phase.",,
32,Using Moon Phases to Measure Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Students also pointed out that the lunar cycle cannot be picked up partway through a phase (infinitely divisible) and moved to the winter solstice, for example, and forced to begin a new phase (zero indicator). The moon moves through its phases, independent of when the winter solstice occurs. As a standard unit, the lunar cycle would not work well for measuring an Earth year. Students found that there were either 12 or 13 moons in a calendar year. This issue, together with the experience of creating a yearly cycle and comparing their birthdays moon phase, helped substantiate the students claim that the lunar cycle would not serve as a convenient standard unit. As students debated the appropriateness of the lunar cycle, we encouraged them to exhaust other options, such as counting days and seasons.",,
33,Using Moon Phases to Measure Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,LESSON 3: THE HOPI,,
34,Using Moon Phases to Measure Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"A natural extension to this lesson involved studying mathematical ideas through cultural knowledge of members of the society who practice it (Gerdes 1998; DAmbrosio 1990). We connected our lesson to the Hopi society because of the impressive manner with which Hopi astronomers demonstrated scientific and mathematical dexterity in marking the passage of time. They understood rhythms of the moon and Earth and used science, mathematics, and literacy to inform their people.",,
35,Using Moon Phases to Measure Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The ancient Hopi had a name for each lunar cycle, or moon, and related it to a particular cultural activity, such as corn planting (Ellis 1975). They communicated the yearly calendar to the people with outstanding accuracy. Understanding the Hopi use of the moon provided students with a solid foundation for understanding measurement ideas.",,
36,Using Moon Phases to Measure Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"To understand exactly how critical the lunar calendar has been to the Hopi, we brought the Hopis relationship to the moon, a cultural possession, into play with respect, admiration, and thanksgiving. Hopi moons were, in a sense, religious artifacts. The Hopi way of understanding time was more of a relationship to the moon rather than use of the moon. We made ardent efforts to be respectful of this fact and exercised caution in our demonstrations and interpretations of how the Hopi people studied, measured, and recorded time with moons.",,
37,Using Moon Phases to Measure Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Background of the Significance of the Hopi Moon,,
38,Using Moon Phases to Measure Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"For centuries, before the voyages of Columbus, the Hopi lived in harmony with a rough, unforgiving desert climate. The Hopi were historically an agricultural civilization, charged with the stewardship of Earth. As such, they lived as a community and traveled away from their homes to work the fields. In ancient times, long before Farmers Almanacs or televised weather forecasts contained predictions, the Hopi knew how to mesh agricultural activities with Earths rhythms. They anticipated correct times for different activities, such as planting, watering, cultivating, and harvesting. The desert climate mandated careful and respectful use of rainwater and was considered an integral part of Hopi culture.",,
39,Using Moon Phases to Measure Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The Hopi associated each of its 13 moons with certain celebrations and planting indicators. Some ceremonies hosted Katsinas, spirits whom the Hopi believed lived in the nearby mountains. One role of the Katsinas was to make requests to the Hopi gods, on behalf of the Hopi people, for much-needed support in tendingEarth (Secakuku 1995). At some ceremonies, Katsinas solicited rain so that corn, beans, and squash could grow (Kealiinohomoku 1989). At other ceremonies, Katsinas gave a blessing to crop planting. Still other ceremonies were associated with times to harvest or play. The Hopi depended on moons to track the time of the season in which they were living.",,
40,Using Moon Phases to Measure Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In reality, ancient astronomers measured time using both the sun and the moon to plan associated celebrations. Astronomers knew how to read the moon and sun to adjust calendars to accommodate discrepancies. The most notable discrepancy was between the 29.5-day lunar cycle (new moon to new moon) and the 365.25-day solar year (winter solstice to winter solstice). Neither 12 nor 13 is a factor of 365.25, so counting out 12 moons fell short of an Earth year, and counting out 13 moons was longer than an Earth year.",,
41,Using Moon Phases to Measure Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Of critical importance to the Hopi culture were two events: the timing of the Sparrow-Hawk moon, marking the emergence of Katsinas from the mountains, and the winter solstice ceremony, marking the preplanting season (James 2000). Either event quickly coupled the Sparrow-Hawk moon with the wrong time of the solar year. If this happened, the people would not be appropriately prepared for the winter solstice, and the critical appearance of the Katsinas would occur at the wrong time.",,
42,Using Moon Phases to Measure Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We used table 1 to introduce our students to 13 Hopi moon names, which were compiled from a variety of references (Secakuku 1995; Wright and Roat 1965; Ellis 1975; James 2000; Sharp 2015). We told them that the moon is an important cultural artifact because the ancient Hopi successfully used moons to measure an Earth year.",,
43,Using Moon Phases to Measure Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
44,Using Moon Phases to Measure Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Students cut out the moon names and glued them onto their wall charts inside their previously ringed lunar cycles. It worked well to first glue the Sacred Moon onto the lunar cycle containing December 22 before placing the remaining moon names.,,
45,Using Moon Phases to Measure Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We opened the discussion by asking, How did the Hopi connect moons to their calendar and plan for correct timing of celebrations? Students discussed the apparent contradiction between their determination that a moon could not serve as a standard unit and the Hopis successful use of the moon. We allowed the conversation to move in several different directions, trusting students to gather behind arguments they wanted to pursue. We listened for moments when discussion wandered off course, at which point we prompted students to remain focused on figuring out a strategy using moons to measure time. One promising result was the general agreement that the moon was a dependable constant, longer than a day and shorter than a season. This fact appealed to students as surely as it must have appealed to the ancient Hopi.",,
46,Using Moon Phases to Measure Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,LESSON 4: DESCRIBING TIME,,
47,Using Moon Phases to Measure Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Being aware that societies use literature to help communicate and describe events that occur at various times of the year was important for students further engagement in these lessons. The last lesson opened with this question, Why would a culture choose to measure time with a moon? Answers included that Its always there; Its shorter than a year; and They didnt have clocks or calendars. (The Hopi obviously had a calendar; the students were just not familiar with it.) Lively discussion among students erupted from the questions that followed:",,
48,Using Moon Phases to Measure Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,1. How do different cultures measure time?,,
49,Using Moon Phases to Measure Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,2. Describe two ways in which time can or has been measured by various cultures.,,
50,Using Moon Phases to Measure Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"3. In ancient times, why do you think many cultures measured time by the seasons rather than by the clock?",,
51,Using Moon Phases to Measure Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Our students studied the fiction text Broken Pattern (Carlson and Qoyawayma 1985), which described the courtship of two young people, Sevansi and Hohtski, from the Hopi Nation. This book provided a useful lesson about time measurement because it captured an understanding about the calendar within an understanding of courtship and marriage customs that depended on Earths rhythms. Students used the text to verify that the Hopi culture successfully related to time using sun, season, and moonall manners of measurement that were not obvious to students. We read the prompts shown in figure 6 to guide students through the culturally powerful story, in which timing was critical for marriage rituals. Our goal was to help students generalize the notion that time was often understood by studying the moon and other celestial bodies.",,
52,Using Moon Phases to Measure Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
53,Using Moon Phases to Measure Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"These passages served as discussion prompts to encourage deeper thinking. We used entry-point comments to focus the conversation toward references to celestial bodies, particularly the moon. This discussion reinforced students understandings that the text validated how a moon was used to mark time for the Hopi.",,
54,Using Moon Phases to Measure Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,LESSON CLOSURE,,
55,Using Moon Phases to Measure Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We closed the four lessons with a final assessment that required critical thinking as well as calculations to demonstrate students understandings of time measurement. The problem we needed students to grasp was that after 3 years, a total of 1,095 days will have passed, which corresponded to more than 37 lunar cycles. Thinking conventionally, 3 calendar years corresponded to 36 months. Our students grappled quite nicely with the incongruity between 36 months and 37 lunar cycles. These assessment questions were designed to gather their thoughts:",,
56,Using Moon Phases to Measure Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,1. How long does it take for calendars to get out of sync if the lunar cycle is used to measure time?,,
57,Using Moon Phases to Measure Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,2. How would using the lunar cycle impact ancient Hopi life?,,
58,Using Moon Phases to Measure Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"3. If the lunar cycle is chosen as a way to measure a year, what adjustments must be made?",,
59,Using Moon Phases to Measure Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Students answers (see fig. 7) indicated they understood that the Hopi had to adjust their calendars to take discrepancies into account. One student, Jenna, noticed that using the moon would off balance the way of life and that adjustments would be needed. Xavier demonstrated strong conceptual knowledge about a standard unit when he added that adjustments would be needed because there are 12.37 lunar cycles in 365 days and you cannot stop the lunar cycle.",,
60,Using Moon Phases to Measure Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
61,Using Moon Phases to Measure Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"INTEGRATING SCIENCE, MATH, AND LITERACY",,
62,Using Moon Phases to Measure Time - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The lessons described in this article illustrate how a measurement lesson can benefit from substantive connections among science, mathematics, and literacy and how those disciplines are revealed in a cultures way of measuring time. Any set of lessons about time measurement needs to be grounded in an understanding of the cultural importance of knowing what time it is. Knowing how and why a society measures time provides a solid foundation for understanding measurement. It is natural to expect that different cultures will have different priorities about what is important in the measurement of time, be they of mathematical, scientific, or literary significance. In our lessons, we studied ancient time measurement techniques and strategies of the Hopi to dramatize decisions made by the societys timekeepers that corrected for the mismatch between the 365.25-day year and iterations of the 29.5-day lunar cycle. Knowing that the lunar cycle will not divide a calendar year, they recognized and named a 13th moon and inserted it whenever it was needed. Studying lunar cycles, culture, and literature allowed our sixth-grade students to grow in their understanding of standard units.",,
