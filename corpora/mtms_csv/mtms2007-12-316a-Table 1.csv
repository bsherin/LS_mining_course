"County School District, Nevada, have found the following geometry activities effective with sixth-, seventh-, and eighth-grade students when they study translations, rotations, and reflections of points in the plane. Students use a local map, in this case a university campus map, to find particular points under a translation, rotation, reflection, or composite of these symmetries. Teachers might choose to customize the lesson for their students with a map from their community, preparing clues similar to those in this activity using familiar locations.",3,mtms2007-12-316a,,
"In activity 1, students focus on the prerequisite topics of reading a map and identifying basic translations, reflections, and rotations in the two-dimensional coordinate plane. Then, in activity 2, they apply these concepts to follow a series of clues  to find treasure on the map. The two activities can be completed in a single class period. Teachers who have used the activities have found them to be easy to implement while promoting student interest and excitement.  nctM’s standards",4,mtms2007-12-316a,,
"The activities and discussions in this lesson address the following Standards from Principles and Standards for School Mathematics (NCTM 2000, p. 232):  •	 Specify locations and describe spatial relationships using coordinate geometry and other representational systems •	 Apply transformations and use  symmetry to analyze mathematical situations •	 Describe sizes, positions, and orientations of shapes under informal transformations such as flips, turns, slides, and scaling  carryn Bellomo, carryn.bellomo@unlv.",5,mtms2007-12-316a,,

"Teachers who want to develop their own clues should— •	 find a map of interest for the local community or school and enlarge it to fit on an 8 1/2 × 11 inch sheet of paper; •	 photocopy the map onto a coordinate grid; and •	 develop a set of reflections, trans- lations, and rotations to direct students to points of interest.  sUMMarY",36,mtms2007-12-316a,,
"These activities offer a fun and challenging approach to viewing geometric reflections, rotations, and translations. By using a map to locate sites, students have a means to self-check their work. As a summative assessment and extension, students can be challenged to make their own instructions to find a special location on a map.",37,mtms2007-12-316a,,
