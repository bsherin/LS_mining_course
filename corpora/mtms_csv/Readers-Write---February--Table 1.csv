14,Readers Write - February 2014,MoRe on “Model eliciting actiVities”,14,Readers Write - February 2014
15,Readers Write - February 2014,"This letter addresses the article “Model Eliciting Activities: A Home Run” by Marta T. Magiera, which appeared in the February 2013 issue (pp. 348-55). After reading this article carefully, we found some critical errors that we would like to address, so that readers who wish to use the modeling activity described can do so confi dent of the correct numerical outcome. We also wish to explore how to emphasize the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSM) refl ected in the activity. We believe that this was the intent of the author. We do this with good intentions only, to explore crucial issues in mathematics education as the fi eld grows in knowledge and expertise.",15,Readers Write - February 2014
16,Readers Write - February 2014,The article presents students’ work  in the context of a model eliciting activity (MEA). Middle school students were asked to estimate a typical crystal size found in three different aluminum samples; researching these samples would eventually result in fi nding the strongest aluminum baseball bat. The estimates were based on images of microscopic aluminum samples depicting crystals and a length scale marker (a line segment giving its length in millimeters) as seen in the original ﬁ gure 3 (at right). This problem and the images (ﬁ g. 3) were taken from Diefes-Dux et al. (2006). ,16,Readers Write - February 2014

24,Readers Write - February 2014,"(a)  (b)  (c) develop a procedure to determine the strength of the material in the bat, which makes for an excellent MEA. The background information for students included the fact that aluminum consisting of smaller crystals is stronger than aluminum consisting of larger crystals. This allowed the students to conclude that the stronger  bat contained the smallest typical crystal size. ",24,Readers Write - February 2014
25,Readers Write - February 2014,"The article highlighted a team of three students who discovered a procedure that involved drawing a square on the crystal structure fi gure with side length equal to the given scale marker. Students computed the area of the square, counted the number of  crystals enclosed within the square, and divided the area of the square by the number of crystals. The answer is what they called the “typical crystal size” of that sample. One important topic of discussion concerned how to count crystals that are only partially inside the square. This process is a reasonable approach to fi nding a solution to the problem. As instructed, the students wrote a letter to the baseball coach indicating that sample A had the smallest typical crystal size (see the original ﬁ g. 5).",25,Readers Write - February 2014
26,Readers Write - February 2014,"The main reason for writing this letter to the editor is to bring to your attention three issues: (1) computational accuracy, (2) reproducible results, and (3) units.",26,Readers Write - February 2014
27,Readers Write - February 2014,1. Computational Accuracy,27,Readers Write - February 2014
28,Readers Write - February 2014,"The images of microscopic aluminum samples shown in the original ﬁ gure 3 were drawn at different scales (i.e., different magnifi cation), which is why a procedure was needed. While reading the article, we noticed that the scales in images (a) and (b) were not too different and in fact similar. The scale marker in image (a) is 0.1 mm. Using that scale to draw a line that is 0.25 mm long results in a line segment that is very close to the length of the marker in image (b), as shown in ﬁ gure 3a (at left). By simple inspection, it appeared to us that the crystals in image (b) were clearly smaller than those in image (a). This was different from the students’ answer mentioned above, indicating that they computed the typical size of the crystals in (b) to be 3.7 times larger than the typical crystal size in (a). Along with three other mathematicians, we computed the typical crystal sizes using the procedure reported by the middle school students, and all of us computed a smaller typical size of (b) compared with (a). ",28,Readers Write - February 2014
29,Readers Write - February 2014,"The correct conclusion is, in fact, that the crystals in sample (b) have a  smaller average size. After communicating with the author of the article, who kindly shared parts of the data with us, it seems that the students also computed a smaller average crystal size for sample (b) but by the time they wrote the letter to the coach, they had transposed the answer for unknown reasons. The error should have been detected. We agree with the article statement, “These activities also provide an environment in which students’ problem-solving dispositions, such as orientation toward fi nding a solution, self-motivation, and a propensity for refl ecting on their own work, can be promoted.” ",29,Readers Write - February 2014
30,Readers Write - February 2014,"We believe that when classroom  activities include deep discussions that require critiques and justifi cations by students sharing solutions, there is more opportunity for errors to be detected.",30,Readers Write - February 2014
31,Readers Write - February 2014,2. Reproducible Results,31,Readers Write - February 2014
32,Readers Write - February 2014,"When scientifi c images are presented with a horizontal scale marker, as in ﬁ gure 3, it is implied that the vertical scale is the same. Otherwise, a vertical scale is also needed to make sense of the image. However, the original ﬁ gure 4 illustrated the square of side length 0.25 mm corresponding to image (b) in ﬁ gure 3, which we have reproduced as ﬁ gure 4a. Comparing  the two fi gures, we immediately notice that ﬁ gure 4a has been stretched vertically. The vertical scales are different, and a square drawn in ﬁ gure 4a had a different height than the square depicted in the original ﬁ gure 4. From our communication with the author, we understand that ﬁ gure 4 was not used with the students; rather, it was produced for the article to depict the students’ process. However, somehow the fi gure was stretched vertically and no longer matches the original fi gure (which was the one taken from Diefes-Dux et al. 2006). This mismatch of scales for the same image actually makes the correctness of the solution impossible to judge. A reader wanting to use this problem would have to choose one fi gure. It also makes the solution of the problem by other students impossible to compare.  3. Units",32,Readers Write - February 2014
33,Readers Write - February 2014,"The original ﬁ gure 5 was a letter written by students to the baseball coach, explaining which aluminum bat should be chosen on the basis of their work. Referring to the three aluminum samples, the letter starts, “We have looked at the data you gave us and fi nally found the answer. A is .0014, B is .0052, and C is .0321.” Immediately, we noticed that the ",33,Readers Write - February 2014

38,Readers Write - February 2014,"We have looked at the data you gave us and finally found the answer. A is .0014, B is .0052, and C is .0321. We used the measurement they gave us and made a square so we could count the number of crystals inside. We would use 3 different boxes on each, A, B, and C, to find the number of crystals at a more accurate rate.",38,Readers Write - February 2014
39,Readers Write - February 2014,We used the measurements of the sides to find the area of each square to then divide the area by the number of crystals inside and find the average of the area of each crystal. We used the same thing to find the average areas on B and C.,39,Readers Write - February 2014
40,Readers Write - February 2014,You can look at the work  we did and see the way we found the answer. We found that bat A would be the best choice to lead your team to many victories.,40,Readers Write - February 2014
41,Readers Write - February 2014,"Sincerely,",41,Readers Write - February 2014
42,Readers Write - February 2014,"Ashley, Betty, and Meghan students did not include units in the answer, although the numbers represent areas (presumably in mm2). CCSSM discusses the importance of using appropriate units within  mathematical practices. For instance, within the practice of reason abstractly and quantitatively, it states: “Quantitative reasoning entails habits of creating a coherent representation of the problem at hand; considering the units involved; attending to the meaning of quantities, not just how to compute them; and knowing and  flexibly using different properties of operations and objects” (CCSSI 2010, p. 6). Within the practice of attend to precision, CCSSM states that students must be “careful about specifying units of measure” (p. 7). NCTM (2000) advocates for students to pay attention to units: “understand measureable attributes of objects and the units, systems, and processes of measurement” (p. 44) and “understand, select, and use units of appropriate size and type measure” (p. 240). Although the students highlighted in the article may have known the units of their answers, the fact that their letter to the coach left out that important information exemplified a missed opportunity to promote mathematical practices and accuracy.",42,Readers Write - February 2014
43,Readers Write - February 2014,The issues described here have an  overarching purpose of preventing errors in the article from propagating further. We also wish to ensure that the Common Core’s Standards for Mathematical Practices that the author intended to emphasize are not dismissed because of oversights. We emphasize that including units and reporting correct solutions are critically important in any classroom activity. We hope that the readers can reflect on such questions as these:  a.  How does the value of an MEA  change if the numerical solution is incorrect?  b.  Are the pedagogical objectives and  values of the activity diminished?  c.  How are the mathematical processes and practices substantiated through students’ work in a case like this?  d.  What can we learn about mathematical modeling from teaching with MEAs? ,43,Readers Write - February 2014
44,Readers Write - February 2014,"These are important questions in learning and teaching mathematics. A suggestion that is appropriate and important for these kinds of MEAs is  for the activities or tasks to be accompanied by an assessment rubric because it forces the teacher and students to evaluate their answers in some objective way, which is likely to detect possible errors.",44,Readers Write - February 2014
