1,Making Squares - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,1. What are the dimensions of the largest squares that Ms. Harper can create without having any leftover cardboard? Remember that all squares must be congruent. How do you know that no other larger size is possible?,,
2,Making Squares - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,2. How many squares of that size will Ms. Harper be able to create?,,
3,Making Squares - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Ms. Harper decides that a nonsquare rectangle might work better for her students’ craft project. She cuts the 588 cm × 630 cm piece of cardboard into 108 congruent rectangles with no waste.,,
4,Making Squares - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,3. What are the dimensions of the rectangles that Ms. Harper could create? Are there any other dimensions she could have used? How do you know?,,
