"Although they are very mathematically capable, my ﬁ fth-grade students were extremely challenged with the Baby-Boom Loophole assignment because they were distracted by what they called the “hugeness” of the numbers involved. They took a lot longer to complete this assignment than they had when working on others of this type. One student in particular had a ﬁ eld day thinking of ideas that could negatively alter the population growth of the earth; I had no idea she knew of so many ways that people could die. When she shared her ideas, other students’ interest was piqued because they wanted to think of more “weird things” that would adversely impact population growth.  3. a.  Answers will vary, depending on the current population when the activity is assigned. In a 365-day year, the population will grow by  216,000 people daydayda 365 = 78,840, 000 daysdaysda year people year  In a leap year, the population will increase by an additional 216,000 people, or 79,056,000 people in a leap year.",16,mtms2011-12-268a,,

"5.  Answers will depend on the initial  population when the activity is explored. The rate of increase will change over time. On one hand, an increased population usually leads to an increased growth rate (growth is often exponential). On the other hand, many industrialized countries’ population growth rate has declined. Limitations on food supply and energy could also limit population growth. ",18,mtms2011-12-268a,,

I think students will be very enthusiastic about discovering the “grossness” of the events and their effects on the population. Students could also be asked to write reports that could be performed and videotaped. The reports could be presented as if they were the televised evening news. I like having my students do research in math class and use technology in a variety of ways.,28,mtms2011-12-268a,,

"This cartoon and the math directly embedded in the calculations and the questions, as well as the ecological and social implication extension, provided my eighth graders (one section each of Math 8 and Algebra/Geometry 1) with a terriﬁ c context in which to engage their brains with real-life data. Students in both courses explore data and mathematical models for real data, rates of change (both linear and nonlinear), and multiple representations of contextual information.",30,mtms2011-12-268a,,
"Students raised signiﬁ cant socio- political issues during the discussions about factors that may inﬂ uence the rate of population growth, including global climate change, birth control, antibiotic resistance, access to clean water, wars, pandemics, and growing income inequality in the United States and elsewhere in the world. Finally, there were the students who, referring to a popular movie, stated their conviction that the “world will end in 2012, so there is no need to worry.”",31,mtms2011-12-268a,,
"Students are truly engaged when  their passions surge to the point of arguing about the mathematics involved in a task, which is exactly what happened. My students debated  intensely for more than thirty minutes, demonstrating not only their mathematical content knowledge but also their capacity for persuasive arguments based on evidence about the question surrounding the concept of “turning the clock back/ahead with eyes on the impact on the rate of population growth.” To me, the answer to the question was obvious; not so to many of my students. They all have insisted that they be able to view the real-time population counter in class every day for the rest of the school year. Even though they all have computers, I embedded the population clock on my welcome screen that students see every  otheR ideas day when they enter my classroom (http://www.census.gov/main/www/ popclock.html). A full week after this cartoon activity was concluded, my students continued to argue about when the population of the earth will reach the 8 billion mark. ",32,mtms2011-12-268a,,
I have never experienced such  enthusiasm for work with rates (including the infamous “show all of your work and explain your responses” directions) than I have with this cartoon-inspired lesson. Thank you so much for providing this learning opportunity.,33,mtms2011-12-268a,,
