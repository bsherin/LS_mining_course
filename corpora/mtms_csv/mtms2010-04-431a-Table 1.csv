"Podcasting for Understanding tThe sixth graders were in my face.  “How’d I do?” “What did I get?” “Do you even have them graded yet?” I had graded their unit tests on operations with fractions, and the results were catastrophic. The class of twentyfour students had a range of 0 points up to a perfect 32 out of 32, with a mean score below 50 percent. How could their grades be so low after we had spent six weeks on this material? ",2,mtms2010-04-431a,,
"I felt as if I had been teaching for conceptual understanding and computational fluency. I had been tough all the way through the unit, giving no points for partial answers. Although we had identified certain generalities about types of problems that required certain operations, their understanding had not accurately transferred to  a novel set of problems. I decided  to try something new. ",3,mtms2010-04-431a,,
"Using technology in the math classroom is powerful. It can allow students and teachers to achieve new heights in terms of thinking and problem solving and can deepen understanding. One such technology that can be successfully employed to elicit student explanations is a podcast, which is a digital audio recording. Podcasting can be especially fruitful for those students ",4,mtms2010-04-431a,,

who struggle with writing. It can also help document multiple facets of understanding and misunderstanding in a manageable way for teachers.,6,mtms2010-04-431a,,
"As I looked back through their  work, I noticed that students’ responses to this particular problem requiring the multiplication of fractions were often incorrect:   Find 1/4 of a 2 1/2 pound carton of blueberries. ",7,mtms2010-04-431a,,
"I started grouping students’ test papers into those that contained similar mistakes on the problem and those that had demonstrated either correct or incorrect but similar strategies to find an answer. I created six different groups of papers, and chose one student from each group to perform and record an interview. The goal of the interviews was to have the students give a thorough explanation of their strategies and try to convince their classmates that they were correct.",8,mtms2010-04-431a,,
"These interviews would be recorded as a podcast using Macintosh’s GarageBand® software. GarageBand is an application that was originally sold as a way to record and produce music tracks, but it was updated in 2005 to allow users to make professional sounding spoken-word broadcasts on any topic. GarageBand is part  of the iLife software package that is standard on Macintosh computers. Propaganda® and Audacity® are two of the many other podcasting applications that run on PCs.",9,mtms2010-04-431a,,
"Using GarageBand to record the interviews is similar to videotaping students or using a tape recorder. However, the process of recording and storing the interviews is much less labor intensive. We simply find a quiet spot, press record, complete the interview, and then hit save. ",10,mtms2010-04-431a,,
These interviews provided useful feedback and showed a wide range of understanding. One student showed me her algorithm and explained the picture she had drawn that proved it was correct. I realized that some students who correctly employed the algorithm had a very shallow understanding. This shallow understanding became evident when I asked them why they had not ,11,mtms2010-04-431a,,

that multiplying by 1/4 is the same as dividing by 4. ,17,mtms2010-04-431a,,
"After collecting the interviews and  getting permission for their use in class, my plan was to play the interviews over my sound system while looking at the students’ work projected on the Smartboard. I wanted the students to see the different approaches that could be taken to solve the same problem and then critique the various methods. I was hoping that by seeing others’ work and hearing others’ thinking that students could better understand. I am also aware of the following point made by Wiggins and McTighe (2005, p. 161): ",18,mtms2010-04-431a,,
"A basic requirement for assessing for understanding is that we need to know the learners’ thought processes along with their “answers” or solutions. Their explanation of why they did what they did, their support for the approach or response, and their reflection on the result that we may gain fuller insight into their degree of understanding. Answers without reasons and support are typically insufficient to “convict” the learner of understanding. ",19,mtms2010-04-431a,,
"I wanted the students to convince each other of understanding. In addition to being able to explain, Wiggins and McTighe outline five other facets of understanding:  1. Interpretation 2. Application 3. Perspective 4. Empathy 5. Self-knowledge ",20,mtms2010-04-431a,,
"Keeping perspective and self-knowledge in mind, I asked the students to listen to each podcast while looking at the work on the board as well as their own. They were then to give each person a score on a scale of 1−10 on the basis of how convinced they were of that student’s understanding. ",21,mtms2010-04-431a,,
"This activity was done during the last hour of the day, which is typically a tough time for my students to stay quiet. However, I knew I had complete engagement when the voices of their classmates filled our room with their explanations. Students actively listened, took notes, discussed scoring, and spiritedly debated whether the student was convincing. The next step was to evaluate their own answers on the basis of what they had seen and heard. If they thought they were incorrect, they had to be able to state their misunderstanding. In most cases, all they had to do was reference one of the podcasted answers that we had judged to be deficient. ",22,mtms2010-04-431a,,
"Students’ misconceptions had been  voiced and they were quite willing to say, “I messed up, just like one of them.” Students were empathetic and found comfort in realizing this shortcoming about themselves and then seeing several correct alternatives. In the past, I have tried to present other students’ misunderstandings on the board in the hope that students will recognize themselves in the problems completed; the podcasts seemed much more engaging to students. ",23,mtms2010-04-431a,,
"This final facet of self-knowledge  is often unnoticed. Self-knowledge is hard to identify and communicate for students who do not write well, which is another reason why the podcasting can prove effective. While studying the role of vocabulary acquisition in the math classroom during the fall semester, I used a strategy in which the first and last assignment for a previous fractions unit was the same problem.",24,mtms2010-04-431a,,
I asked the students to create a podcast of their explanations of a problem before and after the unit and then listen to themselves. It was exciting to have the preunit explanation filled with unused and misused terminology juxtaposed in GarageBand with the postunit explanation. ,25,mtms2010-04-431a,,
"Students hear their improved strategies and their use of more precise, formalized mathematical vocabulary. They can literally hear in their mathematical growth that their hard work has paid off. If students do not see the connection between their hard work and the result, they are less likely to work hard in the future. The sense of pride that comes with realizing the reformation of one’s mind is another way that podcasting can be useful in the classroom.",26,mtms2010-04-431a,,
"Podcasting has made me think  about assessment differently. I now see  that if I want to assess for information transfer, my assessments cannot be too fact centered and superficial. The student who received a zero on my unit test does know something, and the student who got a perfect score does not know everything. ",27,mtms2010-04-431a,,
"When assessment is taken a step  further, inconsistencies in understanding will become clearer. Once you see a pattern, more informed decisions can be made about grouping and lesson planning. Podcasting can be used as an effective tool in this extremely challenging process. ",28,mtms2010-04-431a,,
