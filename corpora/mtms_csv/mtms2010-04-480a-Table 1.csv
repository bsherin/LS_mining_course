"G r a p h i n g c a l c u l a t o r t o o L S mMiddle school mathematics classrooms are changing. Whiteboards are replacing most chalkboards. Tables are supplanting individual seating arrangements. Document cameras and computer projection systems are taking the place of overhead projectors. Communication technology, such as clickers or the TI-NavigatorTM system, are appearing. Computers may be found along the classroom perimeter. These are just a few of the changes that time and technology are rendering.  enhance and extend students’ learning experiences. Of these many important advances, graphing calculators are particularly notable for their portability, ease of use, relatively low cost, and extreme functionality. We highlight several graphing calculator activities and focus on what we believe are four powerful ways to use this technology as a tool to explore mathematical ideas:  1.  Collecting or generating raw data 2.  Examining multiple cases 3.  Providing immediate feedback 4.  Showing graphical and numerical ",2,mtms2010-04-480a,,
"The many uses of handheld technology for learning mathematics inherently involve specialized knowledge that is framed as TPACK: technology, pedagogy, and content knowledge.",3,mtms2010-04-480a,,
"The curriculum has changed as well. Instead of an annual return to previously encountered topics, many middle school students encounter mathematics of a varying nature, characterized in Principles and Standards for School Mathematics (NCTM 2000) as the five Content Standards of Number and Operations, Algebra, Geometry, Measurement, and Data Analysis and Probability. ",4,mtms2010-04-480a,,
"As students explore these multiple  areas of mathematics, activities in some texts encourage, if not require, the use of various technologies such as graphing calculators, spreadsheets, or dynamic geometry systems to help  displays",5,mtms2010-04-480a,,
"However, using these ideas effectively requires teachers to initially focus on when, where, and how to incorporate appropriate technologies for teaching and learning mathematics. ",6,mtms2010-04-480a,,
"The specialized knowledge suggested above has become known as TPACK (technology, pedagogy, and content knowledge) (see fig. 1). TPACK is the interconnection and intersection of technology, pedagogy, and content knowledge. It goes beyond the teacher having personal knowledge of how to use technology or being proficient with it. TPACK  requires teachers to integrate their understanding of the students, mathematical content, instructional strategies, classroom management, and assessment with careful consideration of how technology impacts the learner and the learning process (Niess 2008). ",7,mtms2010-04-480a,,
"In most cases, any graphing calculator could be used in the following activities, although we have chosen to focus on Texas Instrument’s TI-73 model, a platform specifically designed for middle school students. Many graphing calculators also include access to applications, or self-contained programs, that can be either linked or  downloaded to a calculator and then used in the same manner that students might use an applet on the Internet.  investigating algebra  One technological tool in particular gives students an opportunity to “use graphs to analyze the nature of changes in quantities in linear relationships” and “to model and solve contextualized problems” (NCTM 2000, p. 222). Motion detectors—stand-alone portable devices for data collection that link to a calculator using a cable—allow students to physically investigate the nature of change in linear relationships ",8,mtms2010-04-480a,,

"Fig. 2 When students “walk” a function path, their motion can be recorded for conjecture and analysis.",10,mtms2010-04-480a,,

A piecewise function (b),12,mtms2010-04-480a,,
"A concave-down parabola as well as other functions. In so doing, students can model problems involving rate, distance, and time. The slope of the linear equation becomes the rate of change or speed that students walk rather than simply viewing it as m. ",13,mtms2010-04-480a,,
"Students can connect meaning to positive and negative slopes as either walking away from, or toward, the motion detector. The y-intercept becomes the initial distance from the detector, not just b. As students create their lines, they soon see that they must walk at a constant rate or they will begin to produce curves. ",14,mtms2010-04-480a,,
They also notice that how fast or  how slow they walk relates to the slope of the line and that greater speeds produce steeper or greater slopes. The ranger application on the TI-73 used with the CBR or CBR 2TM (Calculator-Based Ranger) motion detector can set up predetermined piecewise linear functions for students to match with their motion. They can then focus on pieces of linear functions that have positive or negative slope or even no slope (see fig. 2a). ,15,mtms2010-04-480a,,
"Another option on the program   allows students to freely explore and attempt to create or “walk” various functions. Since the data-collection process using the CBR provides immediate graphical feedback, students can determine if their conjectures about their motion and the related graphs are correct or incorrect. However, a necessary component in such an exploration is the classroom teacher who encourages the students to provide a mathematical argument as to why the graph should be possible or not. For example, when asking students to walk a parabola that is concave down (see fig. 2b), their first attempts tend to mimic how the graph looks by walking a path that looks like an inverted U. ",16,mtms2010-04-480a,,
"Invariably, only a portion of their  walking is detected, since they tend to move out of the range of the detector as they walk the upside-down U, and  students wonder what happened. This situation gives the teacher an opportunity to probe students’ thinking about what the graph is displaying. ",17,mtms2010-04-480a,,
"Through examining and discussing the immediate feedback from the data gathered and displayed, students begin to take a more analytical approach to thinking about the display and how they should walk. They determine how far away from the motion detector they should be, how far away they should walk, how fast or slow they should walk, and how long it should take for them to walk the total trip. Students then attempt to walk the parabola again. This time, they simply walk away from the motion detector first and then walk straight back. ",18,mtms2010-04-480a,,
"We have also seen many middle school students making valiant attempts to produce graphs for vertical lines, such as t = 5, by running as fast as they think possible, but then noticing the steep but visible slope in their produced function. Again, when pushed to think about what the equation is stating with respect to distance and time, students see that at time t = 5 seconds, the person walking or running needs to be at all distances, or basically everywhere, at once. After that revelation, one middle school student piped up, “Only God could walk that line.” We believe that these examples illustrate several valuable uses of the graphing calculator for exploring fundamental algebraic ideas. The combination of the calculator and the motion detector allow students to collect real-time data and examine multiple cases in a relatively short period of time, both of which provide immediate feedback. The motion graphs created by the walking students also give the teacher an opportunity to ask questions that push the connections seen between the motion and the display, making the concept of “rates of change” more meaningful to the students rather than “it’s the m in y = mx + b.”  ∠ ÑApplying tpAcK to a Lesson  on the meaning of Angles",19,mtms2010-04-480a,,
"While teaching a lesson, the classroom teacher is working from three sets of knowledge simultaneously—technology, pedagogy, and content knowledge—to facilitate and maximize the learning around that activity. If we specifically consider the example of using the graphing calculator to explore angles using the SmileMath application, we see that the knowledge needed by the teacher does indeed lie at the intersection of the three components of TPACK. ",20,mtms2010-04-480a,,
"The teacher’s knowledge related to technology includes understanding the  specifics of how angles are represented in the application, such as that they turn in a clockwise direction, vary in orientation, and range from 0 degrees to 360 degrees. This particular application also provides students with the quick feedback helpful for improving their estimation skills and facilitates their understanding of angle as representing a turn. The teacher also needs to understand the particular aspects of angle measure that students must grasp but may have difficulties with, such as thinking that there is a limit to angle size or that the length of the rays can determine the size of the angle, as well as how to design classroom activities to draw out and at times resolve these conceptual issues, thus furthering students’ understandings. ",21,mtms2010-04-480a,,
"Such tasks require the teacher to tap into her pedagogical content knowledge. Finally, none of this is possible without the teacher having solid content knowledge about angle, such as understanding that the concept of angle is threefold, that an angle’s measure is independent of its orientation, or that a degree can be thought of as being a tiny turn of the terminal ray away from the initial ray. Thus, when using the SmileMath application, the teacher is actively drawing on all these ideas simultaneously and using the intersection of those areas of knowledge to facilitate student learning about angle and angle measure. ",22,mtms2010-04-480a,,
"Thinking carefully about the implementation of technology-based classroom activities within the TPACK framework reminds us of the complexity of effectively teaching middle school mathematics today and the considerations that teachers must carefully make when using such technological tools as graphing calculators. However, developing and using this specialized knowledge is well worth the teacher’s effort, as it can make the exploration of different content areas of mathematics much more engaging, meaningful, and worthwhile for their students.",23,mtms2010-04-480a,,
"investigating geoMetry and MeasureMent A defining characteristic of any shape is the type of angles it contains. Many classifications of two-dimensional shapes are based at least in part on the notion of angle. Thus, the understanding that students have about shape is somewhat dependent on their understanding of what an angle is and of how it is measured. Previous studies with sixth-grade students (Browning  and Garza-Kling 2007/2008, 2009) have indicated that the use of the SMILE application on the TI-73 has the potential to strengthen students’ conceptions of angle and angle measure. Most middle school students have typically encountered definitions of angle that are static in nature, such as the classic “two rays that share a common vertex” definition or their natural tendencies to think of angles as “corners.” ",24,mtms2010-04-480a,,
Fig. 3 Students can view and estimate angle measures using the SmiLE application on the ti-73 graphing calculator.  a motion detector linked to a calculator allows students to gather data for analysis.,25,mtms2010-04-480a,,
"Although these are reasonable  conceptions, they do not complete a student’s understanding of angle. For example, if students can only conceive of an angle as being a “corner,” how are they to make sense of an angle with a measure of 720 degrees, such as the angle that a snowboarder might make when completing a complex trick? In such situations, the idea of an angle as a representation of a turn is useful for a student to have. This conception, as well as other important ideas, can be promoted by the SMILE application. Students can watch as an angle is created by one ray turning away from an initial, adjacent ray. In the activity, they either stop the turning motion to create an angle of a desired measure or attempt to estimate the angle measure of a calculator-chosen angle after its turn is complete (see fig. 3). Because of the dynamic nature of the application, students begin to see angles as representing turns.  180 degrees (angles up to 360 degrees are used in the application). They also recognize that an angle need not have the typical orientation of one horizontal ray. Thus, students’ experiences with the SMILE application allow them to “understand, select, and use units of appropriate size and type to measure angles,” “use common benchmarks to select appropriate methods for estimating measurements,” and “select and apply techniques and tools to accurately find . . . angle measures,” as described in the Measurement Standard for Grades 6−8 (NCTM 2000, p. 240). In addition, the application gives students opportunities to understand angle and angle measure that move beyond paper-and-pencil work for several reasons: 1.  Seeing an angle as a representation  for a turn would be a challenge if the only tool was an illustration in the textbook. ",26,mtms2010-04-480a,,
"Students can continue to practice  2.  Our work with middle school  their estimation of angle measures, particularly with the aid of such benchmark angles as 90 degrees or  students shows that the majority of students initially believe that the largest angles that can be made  are 180 degrees. Watching the rays move and make angles greater than 180 degrees in SMILE allowed for questioning and conversation in class to push students beyond that limiting measure, allowing them to realize that there is no limit to the measure of the angle.  3.  The multiple examples provided in the application allowed students to estimate measures for far more angles than they normally would using text materials alone. The immediate feedback provided in the application encouraged students to continue to improve their scores (and thus their angle estimation skills). In contrast, text materials alone would not have offered immediate feedback and may not be as effective for such quick improvement.  4.  The dynamic nature of the application helped keep the students engaged with the activity far longer than they would have been while working with activity sheets, because the students genuinely seemed to enjoy making and matching the angles.",27,mtms2010-04-480a,,
"investigating data analysis and Probability Many interesting probability scenarios, particularly those related to realworld contexts, cannot be analyzed theoretically with the conceptual tools that middle school students have. ",28,mtms2010-04-480a,,
Fig. 4 A probSim application provides a number of simulation choices for students to choose from.,29,mtms2010-04-480a,,
Simulation 1. toss coins 2. Roll Dice 3. pick marbles 4. Spin Spinner 5. Draw cards 6. Random Numbers,30,mtms2010-04-480a,,
"In such cases, students can turn to probability simulations to help them develop estimates of experimental probabilities for the problems they are interested in investigating. Although the Data Analysis and Probability Standard suggests that middle school students “make and test conjectures about the results of experiments and simulations” (NCTM 2000, p. 248), traditional tools such as dice, spinners, and colored chips have their limitations. They include the time it takes to conduct the large number of trials needed to produce a reliable expected value or probability estimate and the fact that many real-life probabilities are not the unit fractions (such as 1/2 or 1/6) that these tools most easily represent. ",31,mtms2010-04-480a,,
"For a more versatile and efficient  way of finding experimental probabilities, the Probability Simulation application on the TI-73 helps students quickly generate results. With this application, students choose an object type to use in the simulation (coins, dice, marbles, spinner, and so on) as well as set the probabilities for each outcome in the problem (see fig. 4). For example, suppose students were trying to simulate shooting free throws with a player who has a 65 percent rate of success. They can set up a simulation using the application’s coin simulation tool, but unlike a physical coin that has a 50 percent chance of either heads or tails, they can choose to weight their coin to have a 65 percent chance of  making the basket (heads for example), and a 35 percent chance of missing the basket (tails). They can then conduct a number of trials to see how many shots one would expect the player to have to shoot to make a predetermined number of baskets, say, five. Such examples are not only interesting for middle school students to explore, but they also use the power of the probability simulation application, allowing students to efficiently collect raw data for a very large number of trials.  conclusion",32,mtms2010-04-480a,,
"Often the use of graphing calculators in the middle grades has been limited to computation and graphing simple functions. As these examples show, graphing calculators and their applications can be used as tools to explore and address the Content Standards. We have used graphing calculators while working with elementary school and middle school students as well as in-service and preservice teachers for many years and for many purposes. The examples chosen represent the advantages that such tools have over conventional approaches to these topics, including the useful graphical displays, the opportunity for immediate feedback, and the ability to efficiently collect or generate raw data and investigate multiple cases.",33,mtms2010-04-480a,,
"We hope that these examples will help convince our colleagues who do not currently use or have access to graphing calculators that it is worth the time and energy to explore available training and grant opportunities to make using such tools a norm at their schools. However, as with the use of any tool, careful consideration of it must be given by the teacher so that it can be incorporated in a conceptually meaningful way. This decision-making process requires a thorough understanding of the mathematics involved and knowledge of the learners. It also requires knowledge of the available  technologies and their capabilities as tools for learning. These knowledge sets, when understood both jointly and separately, comprise the specialized knowledge suggested by the TPACK framework. ",34,mtms2010-04-480a,,
