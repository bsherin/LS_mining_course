12,Cartoon Corner: Lets Talk Turkey,"solUtions 1.  a. 9 ÷ 1.25 = 7.2, so about 7 people  should be fed.",12,Cartoon Corner: Lets Talk Turkey
13,Cartoon Corner: Lets Talk Turkey,"  b.  Because Dagwood will be eating  too, 5 people will be at dinner. Thus, 5 × 1.25 = 6.25, so  Dagwood needs a 6.25 pound turkey.",13,Cartoon Corner: Lets Talk Turkey
14,Cartoon Corner: Lets Talk Turkey,"2.  a.  186 ÷ 114 ≈ 1.63, so 3 ounces of dark meat has about 1.63 times as many calories as 3 ounces of white meat.    b.  Because 186 is about 1.63 times as great as 114, it is 63% larger than 114; 3 ounces of dark meat has about 63% more calories.",14,Cartoon Corner: Lets Talk Turkey
15,Cartoon Corner: Lets Talk Turkey,"c.  Methods will vary.    Method 1: 114 calories are in  3 ounces; therefore, 114 ÷ 3, or  38, calories are in 1 ounce;  5 × 38, or 190, calories are in  5 ounces of white meat.  Method 2: Solve the proportion 3/114 = 5/x to obtain x = 190.",15,Cartoon Corner: Lets Talk Turkey
16,Cartoon Corner: Lets Talk Turkey,"  d.  Methods will vary.    Method 1: Because dark meat has 1.63 times as many calories as white meat, multiply the number of calories in 5 ounces of white meat by 1.63 to find 1.63 × 190 = 309.7, or about 310 calories in 5 ounces of dark meat.  Method 2: Solve the proportion 3/186 = 5/x to obtain x = 310, or 310 calories in 5 ounces of dark meat.  3.  Sample method: Multiply grams by  calories to obtain the number of calories in a particular nutrient. Then find the sum.    Fat: 2.5 grams × 9 calories       = 22.5 calories    Protein: 19 grams × 4 calories       = 76 calories    Carbohydrates: 0 grams ×       4 calories = 0 calories    22.5 + 76 + 0 = 98.5; therefore,  98.5 calories are in 1 serving.",16,Cartoon Corner: Lets Talk Turkey
17,Cartoon Corner: Lets Talk Turkey,"4.  Fat: Solve the percent proportion  2.5/x = 4/100, or the equation 0.04(x) = 2.5, to obtain 62.5 grams for the total daily value.",17,Cartoon Corner: Lets Talk Turkey

45,Cartoon Corner: Lets Talk Turkey,"The sixth-grade prealgebra students enjoyed talking turkey. Most students easily calculated that seven people could be fed with a nine-pound turkey. However, a few students did not read carefully and misinterpreted that there were nine people and then looked for pounds. Similarly, for the second part of the question, several students calculated the size of the turkey for the four guests. I asked them, “Does Dagwood eat?” One student answered, “Yes, and you better plan for his wife and leftovers.” ",45,Cartoon Corner: Lets Talk Turkey
46,Cartoon Corner: Lets Talk Turkey,"The second and third series of  questions related to calories in food and correlated well with the life science topics that these students see daily. They had many strategies to solve the proportional relationships. The most confusing part was 2b,  because they wanted to use proportions and solve 114/186 rather than realizing that 1.63 times as great meant 63 percent more calories.",46,Cartoon Corner: Lets Talk Turkey
