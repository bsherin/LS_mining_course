15,"Book, Product, _ Software Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1)","In Breaking Through! Helping Girls Succeed in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math, authors Mosatche, Lawner, and Matloff-Nieves address the critical factors that are necessary agents in promoting female equality in the STEM fields. Inherent in this exploration is that students learn what they live.",,
16,"Book, Product, _ Software Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1)","To promote the advancement of females in traditionally male-dominated fields, many institutionalized modifications must be assertively challenged and reconstructed. Messages both direct and subliminal are the visceral lens in creating the standards and expectations for accessibility and integration of women in the fields of science, math, and technology. An environment that not only promotes but also supports inquiry, investigation, and respect for trial and error must supersede the mindset that ability is inherent or genetically predisposed.",,
17,"Book, Product, _ Software Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1)","The authors extensive research has demonstrated the positive and negative influence that feedback from teachers, parents, and mentors has on the sustainability of interest and advancement in these critical content areas. Recommendations and suggestions for creating a culture of inquiry and empowerment are explicit throughout the text. This book is a must-read for parents, educators, school administrators, and policy makers who have a voice in changing the mechanistic lever to deeply embedded structures and educational practices that diversify and engage all learners.",,

23,"Book, Product, _ Software Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1)","This book gives students excellent opportunities to master grade-level standards and mathematical practices with greater depth and understanding. The lessons cover five sections: (1) Ratios and proportional relationships; (2) the number system; (3) expressions and equations; (4) geometry; and (5) statistics and probability. Each section contains from two to six different lessons and can be used for whole-group and small-group instruction. Teachers can use the practice problems and assessment questions for individual instruction. A listing of Common Core State Standards, mathematical practices, estimated time, key terms, materials, and objectives is found at the beginning of each lesson.",,
24,"Book, Product, _ Software Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1)","The lessons begin with an activity that helps students explore the concept, followed by practice problems that challenge students to think beyond calculating for an answer. Lessons conclude with Common Core assessment practice that prepares students for standardized tests.",,
25,"Book, Product, _ Software Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1)","Students will likely find the Fantasy Football lesson interesting. In it, they conduct a minidraft, choose professional football players on the basis of their statistics for two years, and determine players per-game averages. Simulated games using dice to calculate the points earned conclude the activity.",,
26,"Book, Product, _ Software Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1)","This book provides a variety of activities that motivate students to really think. A quick answer is not necessarily the correct one, and problems must be read carefully. An answer key is provided.",,
27,"Book, Product, _ Software Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1)","I highly recommend this book for teachers and students. Gifted students and advanced learners will find that the varied activities will extend their thinking. The activities will also be challenging but enjoyable. In short, the activities will provide enrichment and extend the grade-level mathematics content rather than accelerate students to the next grade level.",,

33,"Book, Product, _ Software Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1)","Making Sense of Student Work by Daehler and Folsom steers collaborative groups of teachers through a highly structured road map of student understanding. This road map focuses on mental models, learning gaps, next steps, task analysis, and modifications of those tasks to engage in a professional learning community (PLC). Because this book essentially serves as a workbook focusing on educational practice rather than theory, it is a quick and easy read.",,
34,"Book, Product, _ Software Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1)","The protocol is structured in a workshop model, highlighting minilessons, work time, and reflections. Other best practices featured in this bookincluding group roles, solo and small-group work, and whole-class reflectionsencourage teacher voice, choice, engagement, and buy-in for a successful PLC. The structure of the model discourages wasted time with its focused outline, time restraints, and anchor charts. With implementation of this design and with collaboration, educators will better understand the needs of each student and what to do about those needs. Considering that data and feedback are most successful in real time, unfortunately, the sessions are not crafted to accommodate a typical 4590 minute planning period, which could force communities to break into more than the protocols already worrisome five sessions.",,
35,"Book, Product, _ Software Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1)","With the reservations above, I recommend this protocol. It allows teachers to collaborate in a safe environment and enhances teacher understanding and effectiveness, which, in turn, enhances student learning. This protocol seems to be easily modifiable to meet the needs of any PLC.",,

42,"Book, Product, _ Software Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1)","Geometric construction sets have been around for years, but Lux Blox brings a different approach to this field. These small, plastic blocks stand out from other construction sets in two significant ways: Lux Blox link together with an unusual joint that allows them to flex and bend in ways that most building components do not, and each piece is identical. Lux Blox makes only one type of construction piece: a flat, square block with connecting points on each of its four sides. There are no separate connectors to lose, and you will not run short of specialty pieces because every piece is the same.",,
43,"Book, Product, _ Software Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1)","The set is intended for play and exploration. The pieces combine well with pencils, straws, and craft sticks. Students seem to have a bit of a learning curve before they become confident with the joining mechanism. Since the uniformity of the blocks does not suggest an obvious direction in which to build, constructions can be more creative than what I have observed with other building sets. It takes a little creativity to apply Lux Blox to some of the traditional classroom tasks of construction sets, such as relating nets to surface area. However, these blocks provide for new exploration and problem solving. The design of the blocks allows an organic discussion about minimizing surface area, for example.",,
44,"Book, Product, _ Software Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1)","I found Lux Blox to be a novel approach to geometric construction sets. Although they are not intended to replace more traditional demonstration models, they offer new flexibility and seem to foster open exploration.",,
