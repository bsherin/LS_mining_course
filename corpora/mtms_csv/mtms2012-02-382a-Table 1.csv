"Math teachers will find an opportunity “to learn, reflect, and grow” in this concise, userfriendly guide on classroom discussion. It covers  the entire process from planning to implementation to assessment. The plan is developed through case studies that are based on current research and the authors’ experience.",6,mtms2012-02-382a,,
Stein and Smith introduce the five practices and then lay the groundwork for these practices through setting goals and selecting tasks. They then share a case study and analyze the teacher’s use of these five practices. The chapters contain information on ,7,mtms2012-02-382a,,

Final chapters include a lesson planning method and suggestions for implementation support. The final section, a professional development guide, includes explanations of teacher activities included in earlier chapters and questions for group discussion.",8,mtms2012-02-382a,,
"This framework requires teachers to commit a considerable amount of time to the process, but the result is students who are able to discuss mathematics at a higher level. Teachers who want to prepare their students to write about mathematics will find that this book sets the foundation.",9,mtms2012-02-382a,,
"I would recommend 5 Practices to  mathematics teachers from kindergarten through high school who are willing to adapt the material to their particular situations. As a veteran teacher, I found that the book diagnosed several problems that I had unknowingly created for my students’ classroom discussions; I also saw where teachers I have coached have done the same. I now have a prescription for curing these problems.  —Lori Lovato, Moffat Consolidated School District, Moffat, Colorado",10,mtms2012-02-382a,,
Using Formative assessment  to differentiate Mathematics  instruction: seven Practices  to Maximize learning,11,mtms2012-02-382a,,

This book defines formative assessment and describes how it can be integrated in the teaching and learning of mathematics from grade 4-6. The author’s main purpose is to provide math educators with specific classroom practices that will help them gain additional insights into students’ conceptual and procedural learning.,13,mtms2012-02-382a,,
"By taking the formative self-assessment in the book, the authors clarified for me the difference between formative and summative assessment. The powerful principles described can enhance students’ learning of mathematics inside and outside the classroom and help teachers modify their lessons and teachings. I was impressed by the description of each practice, based on research from the literature, and the information about the importance of doing preassessments. The vignettes helped me focus on classroom situations and what insights can be gained from assessing students as they are learning. The NCTM Standards were clearly present in the surveys, rubrics, and tiered lesson plans that were presented. ",14,mtms2012-02-382a,,
"One major weakness, however, is that students in grades 4 and 5 tend to be very brief in their explanations. A classroom teacher might need to do clinical interviews to clarify surveys.",15,mtms2012-02-382a,,
"As suggested by the author, I used  daily homework logs to help my students keep track of what they were learning. Students found this task challenging, especially when doing an in-depth analysis of their mistakes while problem solving. The practices described are a great way to enrich the teaching and learning of mathematics concepts in middle schools as well as reaching low and high mathematics achievers in the classroom.",16,mtms2012-02-382a,,

"I strongly recommend this book for a professional development program that involves rational numbers for teachers in grades 4-5. Additionally, the research and pedagogy described in this book are common to other grade levels and topics in mathematics. A skilled facilitator could use the structure of this book to develop professional development in these other areas.",19,mtms2012-02-382a,,

"These books are a collection of daily math practice for grades 8-10. The weekly sections contain twenty problems that cover four days. Each book contains forty weeks of problems, which are arranged so that the types of problems each week correspond to the same numbers. For example, question 16 for each day during week 2 in the grade 8 book involves adding fractions. This is helpful if students are struggling with a particular skill. They can look back at their problem sets and see which numbers they consistently missed. The teacher can then work with them on improving that skill. A teacher’s guide, included with  each grade-level set, explains (1) why it is necessary to have students practice mental math and (2) how to use the books. It also discusses teaching strategies to help students with computation. The teacher’s guide recommends that manipulatives and visual displays be used when introducing new strategies.

"These books cover a broad range  of mathematical skills and can be used to challenge students at different grade levels or provide extra help to elevate students to their grade level. Problems are available for a wide range of student abilities. The skills gleaned should help students become more effi cient with mental computation and calculator skills and should strengthen their mathematical foundation and allow it to grow stronger with practice.  —Pam Evans, Jefferson Elementary School,  Charleston, Illinois teaching by design in elementary Mathematics",25,mtms2012-02-382a,,

"This book is one of a series of professional development guides to help teachers deepen their content knowledge, increase their  understanding of how students learn mathematics, develop more effective lessons, and improve collaboration. The guides are designed for use with a variety of professional development models including lesson study and professional learning teams. This particular book targets those who teach grades 4 and 5. ",27,mtms2012-02-382a,,
"During the fourteen sessions  outlined in the book, teachers journey through activities that model ways to conceptually teach an understanding of fractions and decimals. The fi nal sessions explore how to develop, teach, discuss, and revise a prototype lesson. A by-product of this process is that teachers will also deepen their own conceptual understanding of rational numbers.",28,mtms2012-02-382a,,
"Each session includes an overview, facilitator notes, a description of each activity, references and resources, and all necessary handouts. The overview and facilitator notes reduce preparation time and also make it easy to rotate the job of facilitating among all participants. The activities are excellent. They not only provide strategies for teaching conceptually but also incorporate NCTM resources, such as the Illuminations website, the fi ve strands of mathematical profi ciency established by the National Research ",29,mtms2012-02-382a,,
