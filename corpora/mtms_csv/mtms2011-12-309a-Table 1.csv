"Prices on software, books, and materials are subject to change. Consult the suppliers for the current prices. The comments reflect the reviewers’ opinions and do not imply endorsement by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics.  ment to Improve Student Learning is a thoughtful, thorough book that teachers can use to improve their skills in using formative assessment to push student thinking and understanding. ",7,mtms2011-12-309a,,
"The book begins by making a strong case for the value of formative assessment. By “making students’ thinking visible,” teachers can effectively plan lessons and make better decisions during instruction to help students make the mathematical connections that will lead them to standard mastery. The book provides a framework of what effective formative assessment should look like. It then outlines nine specific strategies for implementation, grouped into four main types: assessing prior knowledge, assessing students at work, probing students’ thinking, and using assessment to plan instruction. Each strategy is discussed in enough detail for teachers to immediately fold it into their instruction.",8,mtms2011-12-309a,,
"The real strength of this book is  the extensive space it takes in providing useable classroom activities, organized by grade level, each accompanied by detailed examples of how the nine formative assessment tools could be used to enhance student understanding. This book will prove particularly valuable for instructional  coaches and teacher educators as they guide new and preservice teachers through the complicated workings of high-quality mathematics instruction. The veteran teacher will also benefit from the detailed account of what effective formative assessment looks like and the specific strategies included in this text.  —Ryan Kelly Roxbury Preparatory Charter School Roxbury, Massachusetts",9,mtms2011-12-309a,,

"Kadhir Rajagopal, 2011. 147 pp., $24.95 paper. ISBN 978-1-41661113-4. ASCD; www.ascd.org.",11,mtms2011-12-309a,,
"In Create  Success! Unlocking the Potential of Urban Students,  author and mathematics  teacher Kadhir Rajagopal shares a set of strategies he has used to promote student achievement well above the norm for the mostly African American and Latino students in his inner-city classes at a comprehensive public high school. Although this  discusses the myths and realities of the effectiveness of video games and clarifi es the negative image that video games have a tendency to incur. He uses his book to provide a convincing argument that all humans are naturally interested and curious to learn and explains that video games are essentially a disregarded resource that, when used effectively, can engage and provide higher-level thinking experiences for students. In addition, he emphasizes that there is a hierarchy of game types and demonstrates how certain game features are more relevant and effective in their purpose of maintaining a captivated and engaged learner.",12,mtms2011-12-309a,,
"book was written for teachers of any subject, many of the examples and experiences shared are from his mathematics classroom. One cannot help but notice Rajagopal’s passionately held belief that teachers must have high expectations for urban innercity youth in public schools and take responsibility for creating a learning environment in which such students can and do succeed. ",13,mtms2011-12-309a,,
"The core of the book focuses  on what Rajagopal refers to as CREATE, an acronym for six strategies that he argues will lead to greater success with urban students. The chapters explore each letter of the acronym: “Culturally Responsive Instruction,” “Rigorous Expectations and Rewards,” “Essentials-focused Planning,” “Assessing for Mastery during Class,” “Test Models,” and “Extra One-on-One Tutoring for Struggling Students.” ",14,mtms2011-12-309a,,
"The fi rst of these, culturally  responsive instruction, is perhaps the most critical because if a teacher cannot connect students with what is being learned, engagement is low. The second strategy, rigorous expectations and rewards, implores teachers to set goals for each student and take responsibility for changing one’s practices when data show that students are not reaching their goals. The specifi c approach he describes—teacherdirected instruction emphasizing quick question-and-answer sessions driven by external student rewards (points and candy)—is less unique. Although this reward system may motivate students, such an approach may be less helpful in establishing motivation toward learning itself as the goal. ",15,mtms2011-12-309a,,
"Compelling evidence is shared  about how Rajagopal’s efforts have helped close the achievement gap, with his low-income African American and Latino ninth graders performing as well as students at  a higher socioeconomic status. Not explicitly addressed is whether or how his strategies might support English language learners (who comprise a growing proportion of many of the nation’s schools serving low-income communities). This information would have made his book of even greater interest to those working to address inequities in (mathematics) education within underserved communities. In addition, the sole indicator of Rajagopal’s students’ success is their performance on standardized assessments of procedures and skills, an acknowledgment of the value currently placed on narrowly focused exams. One is left to wonder whether his strategies helped students also develop profi ciency with mathematical knowledge beyond what is measured on such tests (e.g., the mathematical practices outlined in the Common Core State Standards in mathematics). Perhaps that will be the topic of the next book by this truly committed educator.",16,mtms2011-12-309a,,

Mathematics Education for a New Era is an insightful book promoting learning through video games. It uses up-todate research and embeds its fi ndings into a theory of mathematical education that is geared toward a technological era of learners. Devlin ,21,mtms2011-12-309a,,

BizWiz 2.0 curriculum Kit 2010. $95. Teacher Manual and Resource Guide included. The Biz- World Foundation; www.Bizworld.org.,27,mtms2011-12-309a,,
"BizWiz is a fourteen-lesson program designed to teach fifth through eighth graders the basics of money management and investment and includes both a preassessment and a  postassessment. This program is one of three that the BizWorld Foundation has written to teach students about business, entrepreneurship, and finance. The lessons are written for fifty-minute class periods and require students to work in teams to make and track investments using investing cards and Biz Bucks to model the process.",28,mtms2011-12-309a,,
"The first five lessons introduce the concept of investing, the stock market, and diversification. In the next eight lessons students work together in teams to build and track investments such as CDs, real estate, bonds, stocks, and collectables. Teams work to build investment portfolios and track both short-term and long-term gains and losses. The program requires some background knowledge about personal finance, which is an emerging concept for  middle school students. The  BizWiz English Learner Support Guide available at the BizWorld (www.bizworld.org) site helps build that knowledge and contains materials to scaffold for all students working on these concepts. Decimals, percents, and graphing are the mathematics topics emphasized in this curriculum. The main focus of BizWiz is on investments and the risk involved. ",29,mtms2011-12-309a,,
"With BizWiz taking at least  twelve hours to teach, the mathematics is not strong enough to replace a curriculum that is moving students toward meeting grade-level standards. However, this program would make a great after-school or elective program in financial investment.",30,mtms2011-12-309a,,
