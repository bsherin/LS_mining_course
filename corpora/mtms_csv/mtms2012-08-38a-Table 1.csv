"g a i into the common core of statistics iIn education, it is common to set  aside older curriculum documents when newer ones are released. In fact, some instructional leaders have encouraged the “out with the old, in with the new” process by asking teachers to turn in all copies of the older document (Balka, Hull, and Miles 2010). Doing so makes sense when the old curriculum document is incompatible with the new. However, when the two documents are complementary, a great deal can be lost by discarding the older curriculum. ",0,mtms2012-08-38a,,
Two recent sets of guidelines that intersect statistics and complement each other can be used to plot an orderly progression of study.  documents are useful for helping to implement CCSSM and other middle school curricula. ,1,mtms2012-08-38a,,
"The GAISE report (Guidelines for Assessment and Instruction in Statistics Education Report: A Pre-K–12 Curriculum Framework) (Franklin et al. 2007), for example, contains valuable insight about teaching and learning the statistical content prescribed in CCSSM. This document, endorsed by the American Statistical Association, provides a framework for students’ learning progressions that aligns well with CCSSM. CCSSM places a large amount of statistics content in the middle grades, thus charging middle school teachers with the responsibility of delivering a major portion of students’ statistics education. We will explain how GAISE (available online ",2,mtms2012-08-38a,,

"Randall E. Groth and Anna E. Bargagliotti s e ing into the common core of statistics at http://www.amstat.org/education/ gaise/) is an important tool for practitioners who are working to implement CCSSM for statistics and probability in grades 6-8.  connecting gaise  and the coMMon core The pre-K-grade 12 GAISE guidelines were written to provide a vision of how data analysis and probability in Principles and Standards for School Mathematics (NCTM 2000) can be attained in the classroom. GAISE recommendations span three developmental levels—A, B, and C—corresponding roughly to elementary, middle, and high school, respectively (in lieu of grade bands). Essentially, level A competencies form the foundation for level B, and level B does the same for level C. If students do  not study level A content in elementary school, they need to do so in middle school or high school before progressing to levels B and C. At each level, it is recommended that teachers engage students in these four processes of statistical investigation:  1.  Formulate questions 2.  Collect data 3.  Analyze data 4.  Interpret results  CCSSM contains ambitious  expectations for statistics in grades 6-8. Middle-grades students are to develop an understanding of statistical variability, summarize and describe distributions, use random sampling to draw inferences about populations, draw informal comparative inferences  about two populations, investigate chance processes, and investigate patterns of association in bivariate data. These learning expectations for statistics naturally fall under GAISE, thereby allowing practitioners to use GAISE as a roadmap to help implement CCSSM. In addition, GAISE is a compelling supplement to CCSSM because it offers these ideas not contained in CCSSM:  •	 Pedagogical	approaches	for	statistics •	 Meaningful	statistical	connections •	 Developmental	trajectories	for	 students’ statistical learning •	 Enhancement	of	the	curriculum	 prescribed by CCSSM",5,mtms2012-08-38a,,
What follows in an exploration of each of these features.,6,mtms2012-08-38a,,
Pedagogical aPProaches for statistics,7,mtms2012-08-38a,,
The following rationale explains why CCSSM writers intentionally avoided prescribing pedagogy: ,8,mtms2012-08-38a,,
"The best understanding of what works in the classroom comes from the teachers who spend their days with students. That’s why these standards will establish what students need to learn, but they will not dictate how teachers should teach. Instead, schools and teachers will decide how best to help students reach the standards. (CCSSI 2011, n.p.) ",9,mtms2012-08-38a,,
"The lack of pedagogical recommendations in CCSSM means that teachers and schools are responsible for seeking, testing, and refining teaching approaches. This responsibility can be quite challenging in the case of middle school statistics, where much of the content prescribed in CCSSM is new to existing curricula.",10,mtms2012-08-38a,,
"GAISE recommends the overarching pedagogical approach of teaching through the process of statistical investigation. For example, one sample activity asks students to investigate which types of music are preferred by students at their grade level (level B, pp. 38-40). As students conduct surveys to address the question, they begin to recognize individual-to- individual	variability	(CCSSM	6.SP.1,	 p. 45), since not all respondents answer the survey in the same way. Students also begin to develop strategies for describing data with an appropriate measure of center (CCSSM 6.SP.2,	p.	45),	not	focused	solely	on	 the mean. Since data on favorite type of music are categorical, the mode is a useful tool for summarizing students’ preferences.	Percentages	and	proportions of students preferring each type of music are also described as ways to help summarize the data.",11,mtms2012-08-38a,,
Mathematics  teachers need not  bear sole  responsibility for helping students attain the learning goals in CCSSM if activities in science  classes address  them in a  complementary  manner.,12,mtms2012-08-38a,,
"After carrying out the investiga- tion, students can discuss whether the survey results would vary for different populations	(CCSSM	7.SP.1,	p.	50).	",13,mtms2012-08-38a,,
"As middle school students engage in the investigation and its follow-up, they simultaneously attain learning goals set forth in CCSSM and other curriculum frameworks.",14,mtms2012-08-38a,,
"As students expand the scope of their statistical investigations from surveying students in one class to surveying larger populations, random sampling can be introduced as a tool for drawing trustworthy inferences. One of the goals in the seventh-grade CCSSM	(7.SP.2)	is	that	students	are	 to “Use data from a random sample to draw inferences about a population with an unknown characteristic of interest” (CCSSM 2010, p. 50). Appreciating the power of random sampling is a nontrivial matter.  According to Rubin, Bruce, and  Tenney (1991), students often make  two types of mistakes when working with random samples: 1.  They believe that a random sample  should be perfectly representative of the population.  2.  They have little trust in random samples because the samples do not contain the entire population.",15,mtms2012-08-38a,,
"Students need to reach middle ground between these two extremes. In so doing, they will recognize that the characteristics of random samples will likely vary somewhat from the population but still can be used as a basis for inference. ",16,mtms2012-08-38a,,
"According to CCSSM, students  are to develop sound intuitions about inference from random samples as they “generate multiple samples (or simulated samples) of the same size  to gauge the variation in estimates  or predictions” (CCSSM 2010,  p. 50). The music survey example from GAISE sets the stage for this type of activity. Groups of students can choose random samples from their classroom or school population and administer a music preference survey. Once complete, it is possible to compare the samples with one another. ",17,mtms2012-08-38a,,
"Suppose, for instance, fifteen pairs of students from a class each selected twenty-five students from the entire school population by drawing names from a hat. The students in each random sample could be asked, “What is your favorite type of music?” This question could be accompanied by this set of choices: country, rock, classical, pop, blues, jazz, and other. When the surveys have been completed, each pair of students could compute the proportion of their sample preferring country music. Data from the entire class could then be pooled by having each pair plot the proportion they computed on a dot plot (see fig. 1).",18,mtms2012-08-38a,,
"In most cases, the proportions will  vary from one another yet tend to cluster around the actual population proportion. In figure 1, for example, the sample proportions tend to cluster around 0.3. The clustering behavior helps illustrate that moderately sized random samples may not capture the population proportion exactly, but are not likely to grossly misrepresent the population. Given a display such as that shown in figure 1, students can be asked to form reasonable estimates of the actual proportion of students in the entire school who prefer country music.",19,mtms2012-08-38a,,
The music survey activity also helps lay the groundwork for the study of sampling distributions and hypothesis testing. Level C in the GAISE document (pp. 71-75) provides suggestions about how to extend the activity to address such concepts.,20,mtms2012-08-38a,,
Meaningful statistical connections,21,mtms2012-08-38a,,
"The process of statistical investigation outlined in GAISE helps connect statistics done in the classroom to the broader discipline. Rather than producing graphical displays and summary statistics for their own sake, students’ work can be closer to the heart of statisticians’ work when these activities are performed in the context of investigations. Graphical displays then become tools for revealing patterns and trends in data. Summary statistics become useful measures of center and spread for describing and comparing distributions. Statistical tools, in general, become a means to the end of answering questions during statistical investigations rather than ends in themselves. As students are encouraged to delve into the process of statistical investigation, they can begin to adopt the same modes of inquiry and patterns of thinking used to address authentic problems in practice.",22,mtms2012-08-38a,,

"CCSSM and GAISE provide a set of desired learning outcomes for students. GAISE, however, also provides a developmental perspective on students’ attainment of the outcomes. Such a perspective can help teachers “unpack” the expectations in CCSSM and construct coherent sequences of learning experiences for students. To illustrate this point, two standards from CCSSM are discussed below (CCSSM	6.SP.4,	6.SP.5,	p.	45),	along	 with implications from GAISE about helping students attain the given standards.",28,mtms2012-08-38a,,

In turn, this process helps open the door for communication between mathematics and science teachers about how their classes might jointly address CCSSM for statistics and probability.

"The intricacies of learning about  measures of center described in GAISE suggest that work with the mean and median must occur over several lessons, even though both are mentioned in a single standard in CCSSM. When first working with the median, GAISE recommends that students be given data sets with odd numbers of values (level A, p. 30).

This demonstration forms a basis for learning the addand-divide algorithm for the mean with understanding, since students physically add all lengths together and divide by the number of objects in the set.

"One GAISE-recommended activity alerts students to how changing the wording of a survey question may influence the data obtained (level B,  p. 41).

Students can also study how leading questions may influence responses (e.g., “Country music is the least popular form of music in school.
