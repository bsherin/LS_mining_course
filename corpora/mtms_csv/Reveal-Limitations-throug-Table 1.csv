4,Reveal Limitations through Fraction Division Problem Posing,"Division of fractions is a common area of diffi culty for seventh graders, despite having had numerous experiences with both division and fractions in earlier grades. Teachers who anticipate limited conceptions can help students  overcome the challenges they may face with this important topic. Asking students to write story problems regarding a particular mathematical concept can offer unique insights into their thinking. The ways that students decide to have characters interact with various quantities can reveal their knowledge of numbers and operations and their abilities to access each in realistic scenarios. To identify areas of concern, teachers can use problem posing to assess students’ thinking about division of fractions and plan  instruction accordingly (Silver 1994).

5,Reveal Limitations through Fraction Division Problem Posing,"BacKgRoUnd Helping students develop conceptual understanding of fraction division in a profound manner, based on abstractions of existing knowledge, is a critical, yet complicated, enterprise. Rational-number knowledge stems naturally from realistic scenarios that introduce a need for nonwhole numbers (Streefl and 1991), whereas rational-number algorithms stem from generalizations of whole-number  operations (Park, Güçler, and McCrory 2013). At the same time, students need to become comfortable moving back and forth between thinking about whole numbers and rational numbers (Kieren 1988) and viewing fractions in more fl exible ways than afforded by the standard part-whole interpretation (Behr et al. 1983).

7,Reveal Limitations through Fraction Division Problem Posing,"To open a “window into students’ mathematical understanding” (Silver 1994, p. 24), 201 seventh graders from an urban middle school in the Midwest presented evidence of their fractional thinking by writing fraction division stories. All these students had experienced operations with fractions in prior grades and had already participated in grade-level lessons on fraction addition, subtraction, and multiplication. On the third day of their fraction division sequence, the students responded to this open- ended, problem-posing task:   Write a division of fractions  problem and solve it.

The instructional goal was to identify conceptual limitations that students exhibited that might then give the teacher information on  which to base the final fraction  division lesson.",8,Reveal Limitations through Fraction Division Problem Posing
9,Reveal Limitations through Fraction Division Problem Posing,"Although many students constructed well-conceived, engaging stories of division, 32 of the  201 students left the task blank  (28 of whom were English language learners), and an alarming number of students wrote stories calling for fraction multiplication (23 students), subtraction (22 students), or addition  (2 students). Some created sophisticated stories demonstrating precise use of fractional units, reasonable contexts, and clear wording; unfortunately, their problems did not require division. For example: •	 Ashley	wrote,	“John	had	3/4	of	a	 cup	of	tea.	Marcus	had	2	and	1/4	 cups of coffee.

15,Reveal Limitations through Fraction Division Problem Posing,1. Mishandling Remainders,15,Reveal Limitations through Fraction Division Problem Posing
16,Reveal Limitations through Fraction Division Problem Posing,"One of the first trends we noticed was the way in which several students carefully selected fractional values to prevent their division problems from having remainders. Although choosing fractions in this way was an exciting demonstration of number sense, it suggests that students were uncomfortable working with mixed numbers. This notion was strengthened by the number of students who demonstrated a misunderstanding of the mixed-number solutions that occurred in their problems. ",16,Reveal Limitations through Fraction Division Problem Posing
17,Reveal Limitations through Fraction Division Problem Posing,"For example, after successfully  using the multiply-by-the-reciprocal algorithm to find a correct numerical solution, Anna was unable to appropriately	interpret	her	answer.	Instead	 of seeing the mixed number as one holistic value, she viewed it as a whole number with a fractional remainder (see fig. 1). Notice how she reported her answer using two different unit words:	28	days	and	1/2	cup,	instead	of	 28	1/2	days.",17,Reveal Limitations through Fraction Division Problem Posing
18,Reveal Limitations through Fraction Division Problem Posing,"Instructional recommendations: Students like Anna may be viewing division of fractions as a completely new, unrelated concept, instead of seeing it as an extension of their experiences with whole-number division. Teachers can reinforce this connection using a series of problems that transition from (a) dividing whole numbers to produce an answer with a whole-number remainder to (b) expressing a   whole-number remainder as a fraction (with emphasis on the associated units) to (c) dividing fractions to produce interpretable answers involving a mixed number. For example, start with this problem—“McKenna has  21 friends coming to her birthday party.	If	8	kids	can	sit	together	at	each	 table, how many tables will the children fill?”—and its answer 2R5. ",18,Reveal Limitations through Fraction Division Problem Posing
19,Reveal Limitations through Fraction Division Problem Posing,"Labeling the answer with associated units can be beneficial for students to see that in 2R5 the 2 represents full tables and the 5 represents children. The next instructional challenge is to help students see that 5 children would	fill	5/8	of	another	table. From here, the lesson should illustrate how mixed numbers can be used to represent the number of full tables and leftover children in a single way, using the	same	unit	(i.e.,	2	5/8	tables). ",19,Reveal Limitations through Fraction Division Problem Posing
20,Reveal Limitations through Fraction Division Problem Posing,"Understanding appropriate use of units is crucial to students’ interpretation of mixed-number solutions when applying algorithms to divide fractions. Anna may have interpreted her solution to the question in figure 1 more accurately if she had been asked targeted questions related to renaming her remainder. Gregg and Gregg (2007) suggest using questions such as these:  •	 How	many	full	days	will	the	food	 last?  •	 How	much	food	will	be	leftover?	 •	 Is	it	enough	to	feed	Happy	for	 another whole day?  •	 How	about	a	partial	day?	 •	 If	so,	what	portion	of	the	next	day	 could you feed Happy?",20,Reveal Limitations through Fraction Division Problem Posing
21,Reveal Limitations through Fraction Division Problem Posing,"It	is	also	important	for	students	to	 understand that in some contexts, a mixed-number answer may be unreasonable. Consider a modification of Anna’s	story:	“I	have	99	3/4	cups of dog food, and each dog at the shelter	is	fed	3	1/2	cups	of	food.	How	 many	dogs	at	the	shelter	can	I	feed?”	",21,Reveal Limitations through Fraction Division Problem Posing
22,Reveal Limitations through Fraction Division Problem Posing,Fig. 1 Anna incorrectly interpreted the fractional part of the answer to her question.,22,Reveal Limitations through Fraction Division Problem Posing
23,Reveal Limitations through Fraction Division Problem Posing,A bag of dog food is 99 3/4 cups. My dog Happy eats 3 1/2 cups each day. How many days until the dog food is gone? (a) the question (b) anna’s solution,23,Reveal Limitations through Fraction Division Problem Posing
24,Reveal Limitations through Fraction Division Problem Posing,"It	would	be	reasonable	for	a	student	 to answer this question with 28 dogs or	28	dogs	with	1	3/4	cups	of	leftover	 food. However, since the appropriate unit is dogs, such a story could not realistically have a mixed-number solution. Yet when students apply algorithms for fraction division, they are faced with mixed-number results (i.e.,	99	3/4	÷	3	1/2	=	28	1/2).	Since	 1/2	refers	to	one-half	of	a	serving, not one-half of a dog, this could cause dissonance between the students’ algorithmic solution and their emerging conceptual understanding of fraction division.	In	such	cases,	students	may	 need guidance to carefully select units and pose contexts in their problems so that mixed-number answers are sensible.",24,Reveal Limitations through Fraction Division Problem Posing
25,Reveal Limitations through Fraction Division Problem Posing,"When students can anticipate  how their problems will be answered, they can learn to conceptualize scenarios that better lend themselves to mixed-number answers. That is, to pose problems in which remaining amounts of one item can be realistically imagined as a fractional amount  of another item (e.g., remaining children can be realistically imagined as a partial table; remaining cups of food can be imaginable as a partial day but not a partial dog).  2. Failing to Label Units",25,Reveal Limitations through Fraction Division Problem Posing
26,Reveal Limitations through Fraction Division Problem Posing,"Many students did not use unit words in their story problems, creating uncertainty as to whether their stories involved division or multiplication. This may result from students’ thinking about fractions as operators, a definition that creates unitless fractions.

In	addition	to	reminding	 students to label units, discussion can clarify how fractions without units are understood to represent operators and indicate multiplication.",32,Reveal Limitations through Fraction Division Problem Posing
33,Reveal Limitations through Fraction Division Problem Posing,3. Misusing Discrete Fractional Quantities,33,Reveal Limitations through Fraction Division Problem Posing
34,Reveal Limitations through Fraction Division Problem Posing,"Despite the fact that both discrete quantities (such as a number of bicycles) and continuous quantities (such as distance) can be correctly used in fraction division, nearly all students who successfully wrote a division of fractions word problem used continuous fractional quantities to represent measurements. On the other hand, problems that involved discrete objects were often unrealistic or failed to make sense. Katie was one of the few students who successfully applied the process of repeated subtraction to a set of discrete objects (see fig. 2). Katie’s question (“How long will it  take . . . ?”) encapsulates a sophisticated shift from the usual discrete counting of days (“How many days will it take . . .?”), which is an important step in students  being able to effectively handle discrete objects in fractional contexts. However, insight into Katie’s thinking about division of fractions was limited by her use of a whole-number divisor. Also, her knowledge of fractions in the real world is unclear because the scenario she created was unrealistic.",34,Reveal Limitations through Fraction Division Problem Posing
35,Reveal Limitations through Fraction Division Problem Posing,"As shown in her ingenious table, Katie ignored the fractional amount of a butterfly remaining after she gave away her last full set. This may have stemmed from the way discrete objects like these can generate unreasonable	fractional	amounts	(like	1/2	of	a butterfly) or the difficulty created by her decision to give away butterflies every other day. ",35,Reveal Limitations through Fraction Division Problem Posing
36,Reveal Limitations through Fraction Division Problem Posing,"Instructional recommendations:	“It	 is reasonable to assume that cognitive structures involving simple rational-number problems referring to a discrete model are different from those involved in solving rationalnumber problems referring to a continuous model” (Behr et al. 1983, p. 94). Teachers can bridge this gap by familiarizing students with continuous units during whole-number instruction	(5	miles	+	3	miles	=	8	miles).	",36,Reveal Limitations through Fraction Division Problem Posing
37,Reveal Limitations through Fraction Division Problem Posing,"Emphasizing unit words can help students think about the benefits of using the kinds of continuous items that can be realistically subdivided. Had Katie written	about	running	57	1/2	miles over the course of 3 months, her answer would have been less cumbersome. Also, natural extensions of  this type of problem include rates  (19	1/6	miles	per	month).",37,Reveal Limitations through Fraction Division Problem Posing
38,Reveal Limitations through Fraction Division Problem Posing,4. Redirecting Fraction Contexts to Solve with Whole-Number Amounts,38,Reveal Limitations through Fraction Division Problem Posing
39,Reveal Limitations through Fraction Division Problem Posing,"Contexts that allow fractions to be redirected toward whole-number amounts can interfere with the necessity of solving a problem by dividing one fraction by another. For example, “Dylan	has	3	3/4	packs	of	football	 cards, and each page protector in his  collector’s	album	can	display	1/3	of	a	 pack of cards. How many pages will he fill?” Knowing that each pack contains 24 cards, Dylan could re-visualize this context as dividing 90 cards into groups of 8 for each page. Although a clever demonstration of number sense and a possible application of the quotient	definition	for	fractions	(90/8),	 such modifications can negate the opportunity to assess students’ understanding of division of fractions. ",39,Reveal Limitations through Fraction Division Problem Posing
40,Reveal Limitations through Fraction Division Problem Posing,"Instructional recommendations:	It	is	 exciting to see students demonstrate strong number sense by thinking ahead to create situations where fractions can be easily converted; however, these problems do not offer evidence of students’ conceptual knowledge of fraction division. Fraction-towhole-number redirection was most consistently illustrated by students’ conceptualization of pizzas as a whole number set of slices, instead of a set of slices collectively representing a whole unit. Gabe demonstrated this issue in	his	problem:	“If	I	had	2	1/4	pizzas	 and each pizza had 8 pieces in it, how many	days	could	I	eat	pizza	if	I	ate	 3 pieces a day?”",40,Reveal Limitations through Fraction Division Problem Posing
41,Reveal Limitations through Fraction Division Problem Posing,"Teachers may need to clarify the  intended objective and pose problems that require division of fractional values. Doing so can help students develop realistic contexts in which fractions are not as easily transferred into whole numbers. Teachers can also discourage students from potential redirections by restricting conversions, such	as	1	2/3	feet	=	20	inches, in the problem-solving process.",41,Reveal Limitations through Fraction Division Problem Posing
42,Reveal Limitations through Fraction Division Problem Posing,5. Relying Disproportionately on Repeated Subtraction,42,Reveal Limitations through Fraction Division Problem Posing
43,Reveal Limitations through Fraction Division Problem Posing,We believe that students who selected non-whole-number divisors tended to apply repeated subtraction as their division process because it can be difficult to imagine sharing fairly across a non-whole-number set of groups. ,43,Reveal Limitations through Fraction Division Problem Posing
44,Reveal Limitations through Fraction Division Problem Posing,Fig. 3 Ethan used the common pizza context and a whole-number divisor for his  fair-sharing question.,44,Reveal Limitations through Fraction Division Problem Posing

46,Reveal Limitations through Fraction Division Problem Posing,"In	fact,	fewer	than	10	percent	of	the	 seventh graders attempted to write fair-sharing stories. Only one student, Ethan, did so using a non-wholenumber divisor (see fig. 3). Ethan was also the only student who used the familiar pizza context without converting his pizzas into slices, even though his divisor represented people. He	creatively	divided	his	8	9/16	pizzas	by	a	fractional	amount	(8	1/2)	by	 suggesting, “One person just wanted half of what everyone else got.” ",46,Reveal Limitations through Fraction Division Problem Posing
47,Reveal Limitations through Fraction Division Problem Posing,"The rest of the students who posed fair-sharing problems divided fractional amounts by whole-number divisors. For example,	Kinlee	shared	6	2/3 pounds   of salt between 2 people. Notice how Kinlee selected a dividend in which both the whole and fractional parts were easily divisible by her divisor, creating a problem that could be solved without applying a fraction-division algorithm (see fig. 4). Although Kinlee demonstrated sophisticated number sense, problems like these also make it difficult to assess a student’s understanding of division of fractions. ",47,Reveal Limitations through Fraction Division Problem Posing
48,Reveal Limitations through Fraction Division Problem Posing,Instructional recommendations: ,48,Reveal Limitations through Fraction Division Problem Posing
49,Reveal Limitations through Fraction Division Problem Posing,"Because so few students intuitively posed fair-sharing problems, wholeclass discussions aimed at identifying, creating, illustrating, and solving meaningful fair-sharing problems  involving fractions would be valuable. Fair sharing does not necessarily offer improvement over repeated subtraction. However, balanced instruction should incorporate both types of problems so that students experience division from multiple perspectives. Familiarity with both methods can help students generalize their knowledge of whole-number division toward a deeper understanding of dividing rational numbers. ",49,Reveal Limitations through Fraction Division Problem Posing
50,Reveal Limitations through Fraction Division Problem Posing,"Students often apply the standard multiply-by-the-reciprocal algorithm without having a conceptual awareness of why the algorithm works. Teachers can address this issue by posing and discussing a well-designed series of fair-sharing problems, moving from whole numbers to fractional values throughout. For example, one problem to pose can be borrowed from Kinlee’s salt context: “Kinlee evenly	sprinkles	2/3	of	a	teaspoon	of	 salt	across	1	1/4	bowls	of	popcorn.

The fair-sharing   process separates the fractional divisor’s numerator and denominator, fi rst dividing the dividend by the numerator of the divisor and then multiplying that quotient by the denominator of  the divisor. Although the fair-sharing process requires two steps, one can see how these steps correspond to multiplying the dividend by the reciprocal of	the	divisor.
