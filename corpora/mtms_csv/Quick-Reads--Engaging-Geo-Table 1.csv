In geometry, for example, students are expected to “identify and describe relationships among inscribed angles, radii, and chords” (CCSSM G.C.2, p. 77), including the relationships among central angles, inscribed angles, and intercepted arcs. This article provides pedagogical strategies to develop students’ ability to use appropriate tools strategically as well as engage students in identifying and using mathematical structure. More specifically, this article illustrates how dynamic mathematics software tools can be used to enable students to strategically explore mathematical relationships and structures among angles, radii, and chords in a circle as well as investigate more complex problems.  dYnaMic geoMetRY soFtWaRe",6,Quick Reads: Engaging Geometry Students through Technology

9,Quick Reads: Engaging Geometry Students through Technology,"Little to no understanding of the  underlying mathematical structure occurred from teacher-led demonstrations. Additionally, when students attempted to solve more complex problems, many tasks were out of reach because of the difficulty in representing and exploring the problem with the accessible tools. With the advent and use of dynamic geometry software, students can examine the structure of mathematics in meaningful and efficient ways and approach seemingly unreachable tasks. Although multiple software packages can be used for the purpose described in this article, we will focus on GeoGebra.  eXPloRing ciRcles,  angles, and aRcs",9,Quick Reads: Engaging Geometry Students through Technology
