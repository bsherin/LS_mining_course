37,How NOT to Be a Whiz on a Quiz - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Field-Test Comments,,
38,How NOT to Be a Whiz on a Quiz - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I used this Cartoon Corner to review probability with my middle-ability grade 7 students in preparation for our state standardized tests. The students had worked on probability earlier in the year and had created tree diagrams, but they had forgotten some of the basics. Students worked in groups and were motivated by the context of the cartoon. Almost all students mentioned that using the tree diagram as a tool was helpful in calculating the probabilities.",,
39,How NOT to Be a Whiz on a Quiz - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Students initially used denominators of 2 (true-false) and 11 (11 items) indiscriminately, so in the future, I will discuss questions 1 and 2 together as a class, then assign questions 35 as group work. This activity was an especially good exercise to practice reading directions carefully because I found that students were not distinguishing between such questions as What is the probability. . . . ? and How many questions. . . . ? For the latter type of question, I frequently saw fractions being used.",,
40,How NOT to Be a Whiz on a Quiz - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I assigned this activity the week before the running of the Kentucky Derby; it was a great way to tie probability to the real world. Students calculated the probability of winning the exacta (choosing the first two horses in the correct order) from a field of twenty horses (1/20  1/19). They were fascinated that, true to the theoretical probability, no one from a group of about sixty students chose correctly to win the exacta!",,
41,How NOT to Be a Whiz on a Quiz - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In terms of Other Ideas, I ran a simulation of a ten question true-false quiz using material with which students were unfamiliar: The questions were in German! Since they truly did not know any of the answers, it was a great way to compare experimental and theoretical probabilities.",,

44,How NOT to Be a Whiz on a Quiz - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Columbia, South Carolina",,
45,How NOT to Be a Whiz on a Quiz - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We covered probability in January and worked on this Cartoon Corner in April. The students did not read the first question correctly and ended up using 11 as the total. They also initially had trouble with the tree diagrams. They believed that they needed to start the diagram as shown in the diagram below, which led to the misconception that there were eight possible outcomes for a two question true-false quiz. This made me realize that my students needed a refresher on tree diagrams.",,
46,How NOT to Be a Whiz on a Quiz - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
47,How NOT to Be a Whiz on a Quiz - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"By the time we investigated true-false tests with both four and five questions, the pattern was established. Some of the students called it doubling, or multiplying the previous by 2 to get the next denominator. They realized that the tree diagram was the route they needed to figure out those answers.",,
48,How NOT to Be a Whiz on a Quiz - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,This was a great activity and could be an introduction to tree diagrams and probability.,,

52,How NOT to Be a Whiz on a Quiz - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The students in my grade 4 enrichment group worked on this Cartoon Corner. Although they had already seen tree diagrams in class, we made one together as a warm-up exercise. That problem involved picking tiles in three different colors out of a hat and then replacing them. We discussed the possible outcomes and the probability of events, such as picking the same color twice in a row. After reading the cartoon together, we shared stories about similar experiences that we have had taking true-false and multiple-choice tests and why guessing is not a good strategy.",,
53,How NOT to Be a Whiz on a Quiz - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"As students began creating a tree diagram for the Peanuts cartoon, many chose to use T and F for true and false rather than C and I for correct or incorrect. They were able to see that this naming convention became an issue once they read questions 2a and 2b. Once all students successfully made a tree diagram for the first two questions on a true-false quiz, they were able to work through the next few problems in their groups.",,
54,How NOT to Be a Whiz on a Quiz - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"They became frustrated with question 4b after realizing that it would be inefficient to continue the tree diagram to 11 questions. With some guidance, they were able to find a pattern by making a table to find the answer. They were also able to complete question 5 with little help.",,

58,How NOT to Be a Whiz on a Quiz - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"My grade 8 algebra students had completed several lessons on probability, including making sample spaces and using more than one independent event. After discussing the humor of the cartoon and the different definitions of smart, the students worked with partners. Calculators were not used.",,
59,How NOT to Be a Whiz on a Quiz - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"As the pattern emerged, several students mentioned that they were glad they knew the powers of two. A few initially found question 2 confusing; they wanted to know why they could not just use true and false instead of correct and incorrect. As the class checked the answers together, we reinforced the concept of permutations versus combinations.",,
60,How NOT to Be a Whiz on a Quiz - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The Kentucky Derby had just occurred, and several students wanted to know the difference between probability and odds. We took the opportunity to convert several of the answers to odds. Referencing ratios, we distinguished between part-to-part and part-to-whole as well as the odds of something happening or not happening. All students quickly grasped the concept. We then extended that discussion to our state lottery. After everyone read the fine print on the back of the ticket, the class gave both the probability and the odds of  winning.",,
61,How NOT to Be a Whiz on a Quiz - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"This was the first time that my grade 5 students had worked with the probability of two or more independent events. After reading the cartoon together, we discussed other times when they had guessed on a test and what their strategy had been. They had not seen a tree diagram before, so the first four questions really helped them understand exponential growth in the denominator.",,
62,How NOT to Be a Whiz on a Quiz - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Students always enjoy lessons on probability. They dive into the activity, practicing fractions along the way, because of their natural curiosity.",,

68,How NOT to Be a Whiz on a Quiz - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Have students repeat problem 3 for a twelve-question multiple-choice quiz where there are four possible answer choices for each question.,,
69,How NOT to Be a Whiz on a Quiz - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"March Madness: Have  students compute the  probability of guessing the winning team in each of the  64 bracket games of the NCAA basketball tournament. (You have 1 chance in 263, or 9,223,372,036,854,780,000, which is about 1 chance in  9 quintillion.)",,
