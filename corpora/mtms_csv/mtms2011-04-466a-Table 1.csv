"Playing mathematical games enables middle school students to engage their minds while discovering and using meaningful strategies. Blokus® is one such game. While playing, students exercise spatial awareness, analyze attributes of two-dimensional shapes, compare patterns, and use logic—all of which encompass NCTM’s Content Standards. Students must also engage in problem solving for their offensive and defensive plays and reasoning and proof as they investigate and justify their moves. They make connections as they link mathematical concepts and communicate as they record strategies and answer “What if?” questions—all tenets of the Process Standards.  school math teacher preparation course. After playing the game, they wrote about the embedded mathematics. They also produced a list of math problems that they could ask future students while playing this game. Some of these creative problems were explored and solved by two sixth-grade classes who played Blokus. (Throughout the remainder of the article, the preservice teachers who took part will be called teachers; the middle schoolers will be referred to as students.)",5,mtms2011-04-466a,,
PLAYING THE GAME,6,mtms2011-04-466a,,
"Blokus uses a 13 in. × 13 in. game board and 84 colorful game pieces (21 each of blue, yellow, red, and green) (see ﬁ g. 1). The pieces include all twelve pentominoes and all ﬁ ve ",7,mtms2011-04-466a,,

"tetrominoes. Games can be played by two, three, or four people. In a fourplayer game, each chooses a color and places that colored set of 21 pieces in front of him or her to be used throughout the game. The objective is for each player to use as many of the 21 pieces as possible. Although this goal would appear to be easy at ﬁ rst, students laugh at the trouble they ﬁ nd themselves in as play progresses. A typical game lasts twenty to thirty minutes.",10,mtms2011-04-466a,,
"To begin, the ﬁ rst player chooses any piece and covers one of the four corners of the game board. The game continues clockwise, with each player choosing and placing any piece to cover a corner square. Each player then places one piece at a time, following three particular rules:  •  Each new piece placed on the  board must touch at least one other piece of the same color but should only touch at the vertices.  •  No sides of the same color can  touch.  •  There are no restrictions on how different colored pieces can touch one another. ",11,mtms2011-04-466a,,
"The game ends when all players are unable to use any more game pieces. The player with the highest score wins, as tallied by the following: •  Each player counts the number of unit squares in his or her remaining pieces (1 unit square = −1 point). In ﬁ gure 1, game piece 1 is called the unit square, so, for example, unplayed game piece 9 is −4.",12,mtms2011-04-466a,,

•  A player earns 15 points if all his or her pieces have been placed on the board plus 5 additional bonus points if the last piece placed is the unit square. ,16,mtms2011-04-466a,,
"The scoring involves basic mathematics. It requires using operations with integers and understanding area based on the unit square. Although most players tried to save their smallest piece to earn the bonus points, they found they needed it earlier in the game to break through an opponent’s region.",17,mtms2011-04-466a,,
GAME-PLAYING STRATEGIES,18,mtms2011-04-466a,,
"The teachers approached their ﬁ rst game with high expectations for placing all their tiles. However, midway through play, they recognized their botched attempts and considered what they would need to do differently in future games. This was a clear indication of problem solving in action. They also recognized intelligent moves by an opponent and responded, “Hey, what’d you do that for?” Consequently, their defensive and offensive moves improved in subsequent plays. Comments heard throughout the classroom included, “You’re not getting  through there this time” and “Ha! Now how do you like it?” ",19,mtms2011-04-466a,,
"When the teachers completed their  ﬁ rst game, they were asked to write how they would play the next game differently and to list offensive and defensive strategies used. The most common strategy listed was to use the largest pieces ﬁ rst because there may not be space for them later in the game. Many also suggested branching out toward the center of the board as quickly as possible to begin blocking other players. By hovering around their corner too long, they noticed other players moving in to gain control of that territory. One player wrote this in his math journal:",20,mtms2011-04-466a,,
"I tried getting as many pieces on as I could by trying to keep all my pieces together. However, when the others put their pieces on, they quickly came into my area, which messed with my strategy so I had to expand my area.",21,mtms2011-04-466a,,
"Some players wrote about the advantage of looking ahead. Foreseeing future moves helped them to know which particular pieces should be  saved or used. For instance, if a player was able to create a bordered territory that no one else could break into, then it was wise to recognize what pieces should be saved to play later to maximize the use of that space. While reserving that protected space and those particular pieces, the player could spend time using other pieces in unprotected territory. Also, by looking ahead, a player could focus on keeping as many vertices of game pieces exposed as possible to pursue further expansion. Advanced reasoning skills were applied as students used foresight to maximize escape routes.",22,mtms2011-04-466a,,
"The shapes of the pieces were also  discussed for strategic play. Game piece 10 (see ﬁ g. 1) was labeled as a poor choice for the ﬁ rst piece played in a corner because only one vertex was left exposed. Only one exposed vertex was not problematic early on because no other colors were able to reach that corner early in the game. However, players suggested that it was defensively wiser to preserve this piece for later use as a long blocking wall. They also commented on paying attention to the characteristics of each piece  (e.g., game piece 14 might (e.g., game piece 14 might wrap around an opponent’s wrap around an opponent’s piece to block more of its piece to block more of its vertices). Some players vertices). Some players  also wrote that they often also wrote that they often  peeked to see which remaining pieces their opponents still had to play. This helped them plan their play when they knew their opponent did not have the correct piece to break through. ",23,mtms2011-04-466a,,
THOUGHT-PROVOKING QUESTIONS,24,mtms2011-04-466a,,
"While writing about the mathematics found in Blokus, the teachers were asked to list at least ﬁ ve math problems or questions that they would then use in a middle school classroom the following week. They were given crayons (to draw the colorful tiles) and graph paper (to act as the game board) so that they could draw a game piece on the board and ask questions about intelligent next moves. Their list of questions were collected and reviewed, and an activity sheet was created for a future middle school class (see ﬁ g. 2). ",25,mtms2011-04-466a,,
"The questions connect different  12 10 11 13 mathematical concepts. For example, question 3 coupled the use of estimation with the visual comparison of area. Questions 8 and 9 asked stu14 dents to troubleshoot particular situations. The ability of the teachers to create clever and insightful questions immediately following one game of play was a promising sign that Blokus did indeed spark mathematical vision.  19 17 18 20 15 12 19 21 15 14 20 13 16",26,mtms2011-04-466a,,

"After a trial run with the teachers, this game was brought to two sixth18 grade mathematics classrooms. Laughter and groans (from unwelcomed opponents’ moves) could be heard throughout the classroom as students played this game. Many struggled to decide if they should use their next move as a preventative block or as an aggressive advance. It ",28,mtms2011-04-466a,,

"To allow for adequate feedback time  after students completed the activity sheet questions, this Blokus activity was extended into the next day’s math lesson for a total of one and a half class periods. To close the activity, students were asked to recognize the math used in Blokus. Many students commented on their constant need to look ahead in this game as opposed to concentrating too much on their current move. They suggested that this planning will help them improve their problemsolving skills. Other answers echoed the responses described above from the teachers related to strategies used and connections to geometry and logic. ",41,mtms2011-04-466a,,
"However, one student’s interesting  discovery involved the strategy of creating boxed-in territory similar to a fence (by using, for example, game pieces 5 and 10). She recognized later that this plan backﬁ red because she had many exposed sides on the interior protected side of the fence but few vertices to connect to. In her attempts to plan ahead, she had overlooked the restrictions she was placing against herself. She admitted that, during her ﬁ rst attempt at this game, she would not have foreseen these limitations had she not found them through exploration.",42,mtms2011-04-466a,,
ALTERNATIVE USES OF BLOKUS IN MATH CLASS,43,mtms2011-04-466a,,
"The clever constructions produced in the game make it a worthy addition to any math class. For instance, teachers may use it to help their students explore the four-color theorem as well as the one-player brainteaser suggested on the game’s instruction page. To solve, one student pretends to be four separate players and follows the rules of the standard four-player game. The goal is to play all 84 pieces on the game board. This clever version requires that the student strategize differently as compared with ferently as compared with  was fun to watch their thinking patterns evolve.",44,mtms2011-04-466a,,
"The sixth graders could be heard  discussing the same strategies as those explored by the teachers. They were asked to verbalize their reasoning as they played each move so that the teachers and their classmates could hear their thought processes. Although this may seem unfair because it exposed individual strategies, it made the game interesting because each student divulged his or her game plan. Their comments offered moments of real mathematical communication in the classroom and perhaps increased the challenge of play since the secrets were out in the open. ",45,mtms2011-04-466a,,
Option 1,46,mtms2011-04-466a,,
"After their ﬁ rst game, students were asked to answer the questions designed by the teachers. They were encouraged to talk within their group and were very engaged as they shared their results. Some of the answers varied, based on the different ﬁ nal game boards in each group, but some answers were common: •  To question 4: Which piece(s) do  you try to save? “Pieces 1 and 2 because they are small enough to ﬁ t through cramped regions.” ",47,mtms2011-04-466a,,

the four-player game. Moves must be altered so that empty spaces are not necessarily preserved. The individual wants to play pieces of all colors next to each other as tightly as possible to minimize unused spaces. ,49,mtms2011-04-466a,,
"After playing the regular game, it  can be a challenge to transition to this thinking pattern. One teacher, who had not yet heard of this brainteaser, suggested this idea in her journal, with the exception that she recommended four players (not one) work together to play their colors tightly. As her group attempted this idea, their approach resulted in a valuable classroom discussion. ",50,mtms2011-04-466a,,
"This group’s plan of attack involved symmetry. Note in ﬁ gure 5 that the pieces have 180-degree rotational symmetry about the center of the board. However, the clever scheme fell apart as these teachers neared the center of the board and were unable to break through to other corners. They found themselves restricted and unable to follow the rules of placing their own colored piece so that only vertices touch. Progressing that only vertices touch. Progressing through each step of their challenge, through each step of their challenge, they clearly achieved more of the they clearly achieved more of the “Aha!” impact than would have been “Aha!” impact than would have been encountered through chalk and talk.",51,mtms2011-04-466a,,

"The original Blokus is a square  game board with a square lattice grid. A variation on the theme is Blokus Trigon®, a hexagonal game board with a triangular lattice grid.

"•  Investigating invariants: Analyze an invariant, which is something about a situation that stays the same, even as parts of the situation vary. This occurs, for example, in analyzing which attributes of a ﬁ gure remain the same and which change when the ﬁ gure is transformed in some way. •  Balancing exploration Balancing exploration and reﬂ ection: Try and reﬂ ection: Try various ways to apvarious ways to approach a problem and proach a problem and regularly step back to take regularly step back to take stock.

"The geometric thought processes required by the sixth graders during the Blokus activity used these four GHOM criteria. For example, the students reasoned with relationships when they examined each of their 21 two-dimensional game pieces to compare the different attributes and determine which shapes were effective defensive blockers and which were helpful to save for later. Students generalized geometric ideas when they searched through their pieces to ﬁ nd all that ﬁ t in the location they planned to attack next. They investigated invariants when they wanted to use one of their largest pieces (with an area equal to 5) although it would not ﬁ t unless it was turned over. A reﬂ ection of that shape made an impossible play possible, even though the area of the shape remained an invariant.",59,mtms2011-04-466a,,

"GHOM criteria was the students’ efforts to balance exploration and reﬂ ection. That is, they commonly looked back at their previous plays to recognize which were sensible and which were ﬂ awed. Their conversations revealed that their decisions about game play were inﬂ uenced by their earlier attempts. Through these various four habits of mind, students were able to compare and contrast shapes, generalize within their given set of shapes, recognize attributes that did not change, and alter strategies based on past outcomes.",61,mtms2011-04-466a,,
"In Battista’s research related to  learning school learning school  geometry, he geometry, he  claims that “physical claims that “physical objects can be objects can be thought of as the input thought of as the for geometric conceptualization. Geometric concepts are generally derived through an analysis of such objects: the objects become represented or described by the concepts” (Battista 2009, p. 96). In the case of these students, the physical objects of the game pieces did indeed become the input for their interpretations and observations. Analyzing these physical objects strengthened their concepts of area, symmetry, and spatial reasoning. ",62,mtms2011-04-466a,,
"Battista further notes that “geom- etry instruction and curricula generally neglect the process of forming concepts from physical objects” (2009, p. 97). Although these middle-grades students had prior hands-on experience with some geometric manipulatives, such as creating polyhedra from twodimensional nets, their playing with and handling of game pieces advanced this process of forming concepts.",63,mtms2011-04-466a,,
"CONCLUSION Geometry is a dynamic ﬁ eld. Its diverse use in today’s professions is  advancing at a rapid pace. Therefore, although traditional geometric lessons can be useful, students deserve the opportunity to engage in geometric activities that will enhance their problem-solving abilities and stimulate geometric reasoning. Although some may oppose investing classroom time  playing a game, one hour of natural learning and true engagement playing this board game created mathematical interest and furthered critical thinking. ",64,mtms2011-04-466a,,
"The game play fostered geometric thinking, which was also enhanced by journal writing. This written assessment caused the students to reﬂ ect on and communicate their ﬁ ndings. “When asked to describe how they solved a problem or how they reacted to a topic presented in class, students are challenged to engage in metacognition—the process of analyzing their own thought processes (‘thinking about how they think’)” (Brahier 2001, p. 24). The game itself provided an environment for inquiry, and the results of the written assessment depicted increased reasoning skills. Furthermore, subsequent classroom lessons revealed problem-solving strengths that conﬁ rmed that this activity was a worthwhile use of valuable class time. ",65,mtms2011-04-466a,,
