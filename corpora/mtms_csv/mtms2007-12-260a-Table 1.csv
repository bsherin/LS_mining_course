"Slope is one of the most important mathematical concepts that students encounter in middle school and high school. The concept of slope “weaves its way through algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and calculus” (Anderson and Nelson 1994, p. 27), yet research with high school students shows that they can often calculate slope but are unable to interpret its meaning (Newburgh 2001; Stump 2001). This is a familiar problem in mathematics education; students learn a formula for solving a particular type of problem without conceptually understanding the relevant mathematical ideas. One way to enhance students’ understanding of slope is to introduce it conceptually in middle school (Beckmann and Rozanski 1999), with the understanding that this conceptual foundation will provide a basis for the formal definition of slope to be introduced later on. In this article, we describe two related lessons for sixth-grade students that were designed to accomplish this goal.",7,mtms2007-12-260a,,
"According to the NCTM’s Principles and Standards for School Mathematics (NCTM 2000), slope forms part of a set of interrelated algebraic concepts that middle school teachers should target. These Standards specify that middle school students should be given the opportunity to “use graphs to analyze the nature of changes in quantities in linear relationships” (NCTM 2000, p. 222), including studying the meaning of the slope of a line. This Standard formed the core objective for the instruction described here. ",8,mtms2007-12-260a,,
"We designed two lessons to introduce the concept of slope to sixth-grade  students, with a number of guiding principles. First, we wanted to link the concept of slope to students’ everyday observations and experiences as a “bridging context” so that students could link their experiences to the classroom (Kalchman 2005). Students compared graphs showing rates of growth for different kinds of trees to draw their attention to the contrasting slopes of lines on graphs. Second, we wanted to expose students to a variety of different representations of slope (Friel et al. 2001; NCTM 2000). In the lessons described here, students worked with multiple representations of slope, such as graphs and tables, to deepen their understanding of this concept. Third, we used mathematical modeling to teach students about slope. We graphed average changes in the growth of trees and discussed with students that the actual growth for any given year might be more or less than the average. ",9,mtms2007-12-260a,,
"We designed two related lessons on slope for sixth graders. Because the students were on a block schedule, we taught the two lessons back to back without a break in between. However, the lessons could be taught separately. The teacher, coauthor Vicki Oleson, had taught sixth grade at this school for eight years and was currently an instructor in the affiliated university’s mathematics department. She was a guest teacher for the two lessons described here and knew many of the students. ",10,mtms2007-12-260a,,

"Before beginning the lessons, we asked students to respond to a number of written questions that asked them to interpret the slope of line graphs. For example, we gave students two simplified graphs showing different rates of growth in plants. They were asked to choose the graph that showed the faster growth and to explain why they made their choice (see fig. 1). We also asked them to make a prediction about the future growth of these two plants if the plants kept growing at the same rate. Students were given these questions again at the end of the unit to document the impact our instruction had on their understanding.  elana Joram, joram@uni.edu, prepares preservice teachers and graduate students at the University of Northern Iowa, Cedar Falls, IA 50614-0607.

"Oleson began the first lesson by introducing students to the giant sequoia trees of California. She showed pictures of this type of tree from several Web sites and shared some facts that were of interest to the students (see www.cdr3.com/growers.gr00001.htm). For example, the General Sherman is considered to be the largest tree in the world, and giant sequoia trees can live over 3,000 years. Judging from the students’ engagement in this part of the lesson and their willingness to share their own knowledge about tree growth, this introduction whetted their appetites for the mathematical exploration of tree growth that followed. ",13,mtms2007-12-260a,,
"Oleson communicated to the class that another type of sequoia, known as the coast redwood, grows from 6 to 8 feet in height per year and can reach over 300 feet tall. She then posed this question to the class: “If a tree can grow to 300 feet tall, how many years will it take for this to happen?” She pointed out that because each tree might grow at different rates throughout its life span, more growth in its first 50 to 100 years, then less growth, the class would be considering the average rate of growth of the tree over its lifetime. In actuality, trees might grow faster or slower depending on rainfall in a year, but we chose to disregard that variable when mathematically modeling tree growth over a long period of time and treat the growth as if it occurred in the same increment every year. ",14,mtms2007-12-260a,,
"To figure out how many years it  would take the sequoia to grow to 300 feet, Oleson showed students how to construct a table, known as a T chart, to represent the hypothetical growth of a tree. She asked students to provide input to fill in the values of the chart (see fig. 2a). She suggested using 6 feet per year as the height increment. As she constructed the T chart, Oleson ",15,mtms2007-12-260a,,

After the T chart was constructed, Oleson explored the mathematics and noted that at the end of year 1, the tree would be 6 feet tall; at the end of year 2, it would be 12 feet tall; and so on. Students remarked that the chart stops at 42 feet and that the chart would have to have many entries to show the growth up to 300 feet. As a class, students decided that a second T chart should be constructed, with greater increments of time. After further discussion, students agreed that the time increments should be 5 years (see fig. 2b). ",20,mtms2007-12-260a,,
"In previous work with sixth grad- ers, we discovered that they would sometimes create graphs on which the x-axis showed different increments. For example, if showing time, the student might show 1 year, 3 years, and 4 years without spacing them accordingly. This aspect of the lesson was designed to highlight the logic underlying the construction of a graph, including the increments on the x- and y-axes. In addition, constructing two T charts, each with different time increments, illustrated that tables can be constructed in multiple ways,  representing the same relationship of variables (e.g., age and height). ",21,mtms2007-12-260a,,
"While the class looked at the T  charts, Oleson asked, “What can we say about how fast this tree grows?” Looking at figure 2a, Raquel responded, “For every year over 0, there’s 6 feet more than the last year.” Oleson then asked, “Is there a number sentence we could write to show that?” She suggested that age be represented by “x” and height by “y.” Students responded with x • 6 = y, where x was the age of the tree and y was the height of the tree. Although Raquel had described the T chart in terms of an additive relationship between the increments (i.e., add 6 for every year as you go down the chart), seeing the array of numbers on the chart seemed to make the multiplicative relationship (i.e., x • 6 = y) between the variables obvious to the students, especially when Oleson asked them to construct a number sentence. Students also noticed that the same number sentence worked for the other chart that contained increments of 5 years. Examining the T charts and describing the systematic relationship between years of growth and the height of the tree set the stage for students to explore growth in other types of trees.

"Students were divided into pairs, and each pair was given a picture of a tree with several pieces of information, including the name of the tree, the rate of growth (feet per year), and the maximum height it will reach (see  fig. 3). Information was taken from  a Web site titled “Which Trees and How Fast?” (www.cdr3.com/growers  /gr00001.htm). We selected trees for the class that varied in their rate of growth: About one-third were relatively slow growing (1–3 feet per year), one-third grew at a moderate rate (4– 6 feet per year), and the remaining third grew at a fast rate (8–12 feet per year). This ensured that students’ graphs would look different enough that the slopes of the lines would visually jump out at them when viewing all the graphs at the same time. ",27,mtms2007-12-260a,,
"Each pair of students began by  constructing a T chart as preparation for creating their line graph, showing height as a function of age. The purpose of this activity was to allow students to see number patterns in the linear relationship of age and height, and, therefore, we allowed students to go beyond the maximum height ",28,mtms2007-12-260a,,
"Fig. 4 Christian and Kyle’s T chart and graph that their particular tree would attain. After making her T chart, Jacey described it this way: “For every year, it grew 5 more feet in my chart.” This comment shows that Jacey focused on the rate of change of height as a function of age and on the relationship between the two variables of age and height (as age increases by 1 year, height increases by 5 feet) when constructing and reflecting on her own T chart. Many other students made the same kinds of comments, expressing the relationship between the age and height variables as a rate of change. However, some students described the relationship in a more procedural way. Terri commented that “I looked at the T chart to see how much it would grow each year. You have to times the years by 8 to get the feet.” Molly said, “You count by 5s for us.” Jyothi stated, “The relationship between the numbers is you multiply the year by the height it grows per year.” The remaining parts of the lessons were designed to deepen students’ understanding of rate of change or growth in height as a function of age.",29,mtms2007-12-260a,,
"After constructing their T charts,  students plotted the data points to show the growth of their tree. Figure 4 shows Christian and Kyle’s finished T  chart and corresponding graph. They completed the T chart to model the mathematical relationship of age and height up to 100 feet. However, when they constructed their graph, they stopped at 60 feet because they had been told that height is the maximum that a Paulownia tree can reach. As shown in figure 4, students constructed their T charts just to the left of their graphs so that they could simultaneously view both representations of the age-height relationship for their tree. Note that we had set up the graphs for the students by labeling the x-axis as age and the y-axis as height to ensure that students would spend the bulk of the lesson creating the T charts and graphing the growth of their tree.  coMParing sloPes oF lines For diFFerent trees",30,mtms2007-12-260a,,
"Each pair of students taped the graph to the chalkboard so as to display the work. We asked them to tape the graphs in order from the slowest growing to fastest growing trees by comparing the rates of growth that were in the description of the tree given to each pair (e.g., “grows 2 feet per year”). Some students said they had looked at the number of feet per year the trees grew, whereas others said they looked at the  slant of the lines. Still others expressed some confusion about what the graphs represented (e.g., “I’m not exactly sure, but I think they’re in order from shortest to longest lived or shortest to tallest”). When finished, students had taped ten graphs to the chalkboard, with the slopes becoming progressively steeper, going from left to right. ",31,mtms2007-12-260a,,
"We next asked students to identify  class, “If the line is steeper, what does it tell you about the rate of growth of that tree? Is it growing faster or slower?” were powerful in getting students to focus on the meaning of the steepness of the lines as representing rate of change. For example, Brittney responded, “If the line is steeper, it means it grows a lot each year so the rate of growth is high.” Kyle stated, ",32,mtms2007-12-260a,,
"Slope is one of the most important mathematical concepts that students encounter in middle school and high school, yet research with high school students shows that they can often calculate slope but are unable to interpret its meaning which tree’s graph had the steepest slope, directing their attention to the relative steepness of the lines. Through this activity, many students were able to connect the idea of rate of growth they had perceived in their T chart to the steepness of the lines on the graphs. Rachel’s comment illustrates her understanding: “The most abrupt growth goes last [the steepest]. The ones at the beginning are more gradual. You look at how many feet it grows a year. The more feet, the further toward the end it is.” ",33,mtms2007-12-260a,,
"We asked students to reflect on  the graphs and write down an answer to the question, “What story does your graph tell about your tree?” This question prompted most students to compare the rate of growth of their trees with those of other students’, as Trai’s comment illustrates: “Our tree is called a Canadian hemlock. It grows 3 feet every year. It can get to 60 feet tall. It’s the sixth fastest graph to grow. But it does grow tall.” ",34,mtms2007-12-260a,,
"Oleson’s final questions to the  “The line that is steeper means it is growing a lot of feet a year.” These comments suggest that by the end of the lessons, many students could relate the slope of the line to the rate of growth of their trees and that they understood that a steeper slope indicated a faster rate of growth.  what students learned",35,mtms2007-12-260a,,
"Before instruction, students’ answers to assessment questions (see fig. 1) were based on the perceptual properties of the graphs. For example, when students were asked which graph shows a plant growing at a faster rate, they often responded, “Graph B is halfway, and graph A is lower than B” and “Because the height line goes higher.” After our instruction, however, the majority of students’ answers indicated that they were paying attention to the rate of growth represented by the lines. They also used the word slope appropriately: “the slope is steeper” and “because the slope of B is greater than the slope of A.” ",36,mtms2007-12-260a,,
"Responses to a question asking  students to predict which of two plants would be taller in 2 years if they continued to grow at the same rate illustrated the same pattern. Before instruction, students noted the visual properties of the lines on the graphs (e.g., “Plant B because it is already 1/2 of the graph, and graph A is 1/4 of the graph”). After instruction, students based their answers much more often on a conceptual understanding of the graphs (e.g., Plant B—the slope will keep moving at the same rate”; “Plant B because it has a bigger slope so it grows faster”). Students’ responses suggest that the instruction helped them to more deeply appreciate the relationships that graphs are designed to represent and to understand the meaning of the slope of a line.  reFlections",37,mtms2007-12-260a,,
"Students’ responses to the pre- and postassessment questions suggest that the lessons described here were effective for introducing the concept of slope in such a way that students were able to build from familiar perceptual experiences, that of observing growth in trees, to a more mathematical understanding of slope that integrated pictorial, tabular, graphic, and verbal representations. Change-over-time relationships appear to be an effective context for exploring slope in middle school in that students were able to relate to the familiar context of the growth of different kinds of trees and compare these growth patterns by examining line graphs. Students’ responses to our assessments indicate that they were more comfortable using appropriate mathematical vocabulary to describe their graphs after our instruction. The following are some extensions that we considered for our unit: 1. Exploring additional change-overtime relationships.

Although written for fourth-grade students, the authors note that it can be used for fifth- and sixth-grade students, as well. Activities describe graphing plant growth and population change over time.  2. Introducing slope in other contexts. ",40,mtms2007-12-260a,,
"To broaden students’ understanding, introduce students to slope in contexts that do not involve change over time. For example, Joram, Oleson, and Sabey (2005) asked students to compare the relationship between square footage of houses and house prices in two widely varying cities: La Jolla, California, and Cedar Falls, Iowa. Students graphed the asking price as a function of square footage for a number of houses in both cities and constructed a line of best fit for each city’s houses. They discussed whether there was a linear relationship between square footage and asking price in both cities. Students compared where the lines fell on the graph with differences in their slopes, generating reasons to account for the patterns they perceived.  3. Extending symbolic algebra. ",41,mtms2007-12-260a,,
"Given that the NCTM’s Principles and Standards (2000) identifies slope as a concept to be targeted in grades 6–8, continued experiences in seventh and eighth grade, particularly focusing on linear relationships and the use of symbolic algebra, should deepen and extend students’ understanding. Providing tasks that link students’ experiences with both graphing and algebraic formulae will be necessary for students to fully understand the concept of slope.  conclusions",42,mtms2007-12-260a,,
"Students have been repeatedly exposed to real-life data that embody changeover-time relationships. By drawing on these experiences, students should be able to perceive that pairs of variables change together systematically, even when they have not seen this relationship represented graphically. Change- over-time relationships, such as those highlighted in our exploration of tree growth, seem like a fruitful context in which to introduce the concept of slope to middle school students. In addition, as suggested by Smith (2003), instruction on stasis and change can potentially provide a “conceptually rich theme” that cuts across the K–12 mathematics curriculum.
