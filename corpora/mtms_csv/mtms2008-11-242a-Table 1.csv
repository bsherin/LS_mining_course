After-School Programs: A Different Kind  of Learning,2,mtms2008-11-242a,,
"My sixth grader attends an after-school program to get help with mathematics. My child gets passing grades but struggles with assignments. Lately, I have heard complaints that the program is boring; the work is the same as that in class, but my child still does not “get” it. The assignments appear to be simply pages out of a workbook. I thought the after-school program would be different. Is it just about getting more practice? Is my expectation wrong?",3,mtms2008-11-242a,,
"This question brings up an important issue about after-school programs. Traditionally, these programs have involved electives, such as music, art, sports, and health. Recently, however, after-school programs have been asked to focus on core academic subjects, such as mathematics and reading, with the goal of increasing academic achievement. ",4,mtms2008-11-242a,,
"The after-school program can be a lively and enriching experience for students, filled with opportunities to explore mathematics, work with others in examining mathematical concepts, and learn at their own pace.",5,mtms2008-11-242a,,

"As a classroom teacher, you can assist in several ways to support afterschool staff in providing appropriate yet engaging tasks that help students understand topics that they are struggling with in mathematics. Do you have a mathematics investigation or a problem that helps students develop an understanding of a particular mathematics concept? Share it with the after-school staff. Often, those staff members will have more time to allow students to explore or investigate mathematics without the next bell looming over the class. ",7,mtms2008-11-242a,,
"In-depth investigations have the capacity to increase students’ motivation, enthusiasm, and interest in learning mathematics and solving problems. Furthermore, these opportunities can be fostered by giving students problems that are interesting or relevant to them. As students consider possible solutions, they must rethink their preconceptions and  (Continued on page 244)",8,mtms2008-11-242a,,

I thought the after-school  program would be different. Is it just about getting more   practice? Is my expectation wrong?aAt times, students may need a little  more practice in mathematics. However, if your child is struggling with assignments, it could be that he or she does not understand the mathematics at hand. Furthermore, students often find it frustrating to be given more work in an area in which they are experiencing difficulty or not understanding the concepts or tasks.",11,mtms2008-11-242a,,
"Your child may be having difficulty in mathematics class for a variety of reasons. So, your first step is to speak with him or her about any problems being encountered. Some of the most common issues are that he or she may— •  be hesitant to ask questions in class  because of the teacher’s pacing; •  be reluctant to ask questions so as  not to let peers know that he or she does not understand something that everyone else seems to know; or •  feel that the teacher does not have the time in class to stop and help him or her.",12,mtms2008-11-242a,,

"After-school programs in the past provided a variety of activities or were a place for students to do their homework with some assistance. Recently, the focus has been on showing evidence of increased student achievement. As a result, many after-school programs are now providing support in content areas such as mathematics, reading, and science. This might explain the worksheets that your son or daughter is finding frustrating.",15,mtms2008-11-242a,,
"After-school programs have the advantage of more time to dedicate to problem solving, discussion, and peer-to-peer teaching and learning.

"Let the instructors know that you want to work together to ensure your child’s success and that the sessions are becoming frustrating. Ask the staff for advice, suggestions, or resources to help your child understand the mathematics at hand. ",18,mtms2008-11-242a,,
"Another action you might take is to volunteer in the after-school program. You will have an opportunity to see how it is organized, how many students attend, how it is staffed, and what other types of mathematics activities or work are being given to students. ",19,mtms2008-11-242a,,
"You can also take on an important  role, not just for your child but for other students as well, by joining a parent advisory group at your school. In this capacity, you can make suggestions for school programs. Joining or attending the Parent Teacher Organization at your school can also provide another resource: other parents. Chances are that other families have the same concerns or questions. You might recommend that the after-school program provider host a workshop on how parents can support their children’s mathematical understanding.",20,mtms2008-11-242a,,
"Many Internet sites support mathematics learning and teaching. Some offer specific mathematics problems, explanations, and answers to problems that are similar to those in textbooks. Some sites are free, whereas others charge fees for their use, but sample activities are on most of them. There are also Web sites for parents and students seeking hints, solutions, and models for mathematics problems. Some afterschool programs feature technologyassisted tutoring as well.",21,mtms2008-11-242a,,

"The following components of  high-quality after-school programs can be found in the toolkit provided by the National Partnership for Quality Afterschool Learning (U.S. Department of Education).  •  Mathematics projects: Projects allow students to form working groups that meet the needs of the task at hand. Choosing the necessary materials and creating timetables are all parts of organizational thinking. Integrating content or providing choices that allow students to integrate other content areas, such as history or art, adds depth to a project.",32,mtms2008-11-242a,,
•  Mathematics stations: Stations allow students to explore ideas without the pressure of having to complete assignments by a predetermined time. Stations can incorporate problems or tasks that allow for varied ability levels and divergent ways of thinking and finding solutions.,33,mtms2008-11-242a,,

•  Tutoring: Tutoring should be specific to the needs of the individual student. It is important that the  teacher and the tutor communicate to find out where the student is having difficulty understanding or applying the concept.,36,mtms2008-11-242a,,

"The family is a crucial part of a student’s mathematics education. However, middle school is a critical fork in the road for many families. Many parents hit a wall in their own understanding of the mathematics that students encounter at school. Invite parents to become partners in mathematics education by communicating with them and providing resources that they can use to help their children.",38,mtms2008-11-242a,,
"Working closely with after-school staff is important if we as classroom teachers are to meet the specific needs of students. Discussing difficulties as well as successes in the classroom can help the staff identify how best to work with students in effective and motivating ways. If you are a principal, ask staff members to note which students are making noticeable progress and to acknowledge them appropriately.",39,mtms2008-11-242a,,
