0,Empowering Mathematical Practices - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"As mathematics teachers, we want to empower students as mathematical thinkers and doers (NCTM 2000). Specific ways of thinking and doing mathematics were described in the Process Standards (NCTM 2000); they were further characterized as habits of mind (Mark, Goldenberg, and Sword 2010); and more recently, they were detailed in the Common Cores Standards for Mathematical Practice (CCSSI 2010). Mathematical practices (or MPs) are essential practices that students use to make sense of concepts and procedures. Through formative assessment, students work can be used to help them become aware of MPs and improve their capacity to think and behave like mathematicians: that is, to use mathematical tools to explore situations and solve problems, to uncover and describe the structure of relationships, and to create and evaluate mathematical arguments. In this article, we describe and illustrate a formative assessment process to improve students proficiencies in the MPs and suggest differentiated feedback to support learning progressions for MPs.",,
1,Empowering Mathematical Practices - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We use Heritages (2007) definition of formative assessment as a planned process occurring during a lesson in which teachers collect data on their students current learning and use it to adapt the lesson and provide feedback. Students are also part of the process in that they know the learning goals and are expected to act on the feedback. Our process involved interpreting each element in Heritages (2007) Planned for Interaction framework in light of improving student proficiencies in the MPs. Although we sometimes use a similar process to support learning concepts and procedures, this focus on the MPs changed what we looked for and the types of feedback we gave students. Students increased use of the MPs then supported conceptual understanding and procedural fluency. Table 1 describes Heritages four elements and relates them to formative assessment of the MPs. While planning the lesson, we embedded elements 3 and 4 in element 2. That is, we provided feedback (element 2) that indicated our expectations for student responses (element 3) to use higher levels of the MPs (element 4).",,

3,Empowering Mathematical Practices - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We illustrate the process with a task (see fig. 1), which we used in three developmental algebra classes at a public university and also in a professional development project for middle school and high school teachers teaching first-year algebra. Students had graphing or scientific calculators, and after working alone for a few minutes, they worked in small groups. The student work and explanations are not from specific students, but are typical of what we saw and heard during the lessons.",,
4,Empowering Mathematical Practices - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
5,Empowering Mathematical Practices - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We chose this task to introduce the structure of quadratic functions. This task contrasted with linear functions from a previous unit and gave students a new situation for writing expressions to represent repeated calculations. By leaving the task open, we expected students to use a variety of representations to explore the pattern; then we used their representations to develop conceptual understanding of quadratic behavior. Too often, students create tables, graphs, or equations only when directed to do so, but this task gave them the opportunity to choose representations as tools for thinking, which would also indicate proficient uses of the MPs.",,
6,Empowering Mathematical Practices - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We wanted students to make connections from the arithmetic structure to algebraic structure, and planned our formative assessment to target this goal. Since they had only worked with linear functions, we expected students to struggle with the nonlinear situation, but we wanted them to resolve their difficulties through improved use of MPs. Because of this goal, when planning we focused on ways to support MP 7: Look for and make use of structure, as students explored the new structure of quadratic functions (CCSSI 2010). We also planned to encourage proficiency in MP 8: Look for and express regularity in repeated reasoning, as they performed the same calculation with different numbers and wrote an expression to represent their calculations; and MP 3: Construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others, as they provided justifications for their conjectures (CCSSI 2010). Although they used other MPs, these three practices best matched our goals for student learning, so we anticipated what they might do in terms of these and planned ways to help them further develop.",,
7,Empowering Mathematical Practices - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"During the lesson, we examined student work for evidence of how they looked for patterns or structure, how they described their repeated reasoning, and how they justified their conjectures. Student work fell along a learning progression of these practices and could be categorized into three levels, as shown in table 2, which encapsulates our planning for the four elements of formative assessment. The first column describes element 1: the gaps between student work and proficient uses of the MPs. The second column refers to element 2, providing ideas for feedback as well as questions designed to support students reflection and involvement. Element 3 comes into play with the expectation that students will respond to the feedback. Element 4 of the framework is illustrated by the progression of levels of MP use.",,
8,Empowering Mathematical Practices - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
9,Empowering Mathematical Practices - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In the following sections, we illustrate how we used the framework in classroom interaction. Note that as students responded to the feedback or answered questions, they created new work at higher levels, so the levels describe not students but rather snapshots of their proficiencies in the MPs at particular times in the lesson. Also, some student work manifested proficiency in one MP but not another. For example, a students work could show beginning proficiencies in MP 3 by providing some reasoning, but no awareness of the need to look for structure, which is MP 7.",,

11,Empowering Mathematical Practices - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Identifying the Gap,,
12,Empowering Mathematical Practices - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"As we walked around, we saw some students writing results from their calculators, or guesses and corresponding results, in no discernibly organized way. Their work showed no evidence that they were looking for patterns or structure or that they were aware of their reasoning. These students often gave up when higher guesses did not yield better results. Before working on this task, students had seen linear functions, so we expected this response. Some of their confusion was because they were unaware of their assumption of linearity. However, this problematic aspect was exactly what prompted the need for MPs and made the task such a valuable learning device.",,
13,Empowering Mathematical Practices - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Feedback to Increase Proficiency and Involvement,,
14,Empowering Mathematical Practices - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We also put the work shown in figure 2 into this identifying-the-gap category. Although the student had used a table, she had not used it in a way that could help her see patterns or structure. To prompt her to reflect on what she had done, we asked, You found results for your guesses of 1, 10, 6, and 3. Why did you choose these four numbers? We also asked this question of students with guesses scattered on their papers. It helped the students reflect on why they chose specific numbers and helped them become aware of the need to use reasoning. Students explanations usually involved reasoning based on their latest result rather than on looking for a pattern or structure. We continued, Can you put the numbers youve guessed in an order that could help you look for a pattern? to help her see the purpose in using a table to examine two varying quantities. Indeed, further along the learning progression of proficiency in seeing structure, students should develop a global view of relations. Developing this view requires students to consider an entire table of values, imagine both columns continuing, and focus on the relationship between the columns. But in this situation, to get students to persevere and develop a thoughtful plan, we asked, If you must use three more numbers for the guess column, what numbers would you choose and why?",,

17,Empowering Mathematical Practices - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The scenarios discussed above are examples of what occurred with the majority of students early in the lessons. In response to our questioning, students adjusted their processes and organized their work to look for patterns or structure, resulting in higher-level uses of MPs. This work is described in the next two sections and demonstrates how students improved their use of MPs along the progression described in table 2.",,

20,Empowering Mathematical Practices - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"A second group of student work could be used to notice structure or patterns but did not include conclusions; students needed support to see and generalize about the structure of their expressions. Others in this group had described structure but had reached incorrect conclusions, so they needed to revisit their reasoning.",,
21,Empowering Mathematical Practices - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Feedback to Increase Proficiency and Involvement,,
22,Empowering Mathematical Practices - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The student work in figure 3 shows evidence of structure, but the student may not see or be able to describe it. To prompt her, we asked, Without calculating it, how could you know if guessing 15 would result in a positive or negative? This question helped the student attend to the structure of the two number expressions and of the expression combined. Several students responded to these and similar questions by comparing the expressions and realizing that the first two results are negative because a larger number is subtracted from a smaller number. By reasoning about how the expressions were formed, students noticed that choosing numbers larger than 9 resulted in negative numbers, whereas choosing positive numbers smaller than 9 yielded positive result.",,
23,Empowering Mathematical Practices - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
24,Empowering Mathematical Practices - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In similar instances, we asked, Can you find a number that makes your calculation zero? This question, which helped students notice a special case, was a good way to elicit higher-level reasoning. We expected students to reason that using either 0 or 9 resulted in 0. We then pressed for continued exploration, with What other numbers, besides 5, would give you a positive result?",,
25,Empowering Mathematical Practices - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Other students also benefited from explaining what their expressions told them to doin this case, to understand the expression and compare it with the original game description. After providing feedback to the student that her strategy of writing a general expression was a good step toward solving the problem (see fig. 4), we asked her to compare her expression with the game, so she would notice that she had misrepresented the situation. After she wrote the correct expression, 9(num)  (num)2, we asked, What can you describe about the expression you wrote? For example, can you think of a result you can get without calculating? Again, avoiding the calculation helped her focus on the structure.",,

The next section describes specific examples of their improved proficiencies and how we pressed them for reasoning.",,

31,Empowering Mathematical Practices - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The third group of student work displayed more proficiency in the MPs than the other two groups, but it still showed room for growth. This work included statements of generalizations, or it described clear patterns or structure. An example of a more proficient use of MP 3 was listing conjectures, which showed evidence of breaking the problem into cases (see fig. 5). In other examples, students showed more proficiency in MP 7 by writing two columns of numbers until they saw a pattern (see fig. 6).",,

34,Empowering Mathematical Practices - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Feedback to Increase Proficiency and Involvement,,
35,Empowering Mathematical Practices - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Pointing to the work in figure 5, we noticed aloud that the student seemed to consider cases based on input values: below 0, above 10, and between 0 and 10. We asked, How do you know that 10 and a number above 10 will always give you a negative result? This encouraged her to justify her generalization by going beyond noticing a pattern to reasoning on the basis of structure. Or, to press for reflection on the procedures that resulted in 0 and 10, we asked, How did you find 0 and 10? Several students who wrote conjectures similar to those in figure 5 did not identify a best value to guess, or they identified 8 as the best value. We conjecture that they guessed 8 because it is the highest integer guess before 9; they noticed that only guesses between 0 and 9 gave positive results, but they needed help examining how results varied between guesses of 0 and 9. We asked, What results do you get when you choose values between 0 and 10? Students used their calculators to input the other values and were often surprised at the results.",,
36,Empowering Mathematical Practices - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We saw several students use an equals sign to indicate the relationship between a guess and result (see fig. 6). Although this work could also be considered level 2, the use of all integer values in an appropriate range suggested that one student had used this as an organized list to see a pattern. Before encouraging her to describe and explain the pattern, we prompted her with this statement: I dont think you mean that 2 is equal to 14. What do you mean by all the equal signs in your work? What representation could you use to represent your thinking? We wanted students to use tables as tools for organizing their thinking and seeing patterns or structure. Considering this students work even further, we did not know if she had considered guesses less than 0 or if she could justify that all guesses greater than 9 give negative results. Because our goal was for students to see structure in quadratic expressions, we wanted them to reflect on their work and devise arguments based on the structure of the expression, while considering all real numbers. Can you describe the process you used to find your results? We encouraged students to write numerical expressions to help them see structure and write a general expression. Explain how you know it will keep going down when you choose numbers larger than 10. For example, what if you guess one million? Mason, Graham, and Johnston-Wilder (2005) explain that suggesting large unwieldy numbers for input values encourages students to reflect on structure and process because calculating with the large number seems more difficult.",,
37,Empowering Mathematical Practices - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"As we walked around, we continued to note potential in students work for more proficient uses of MPs and to give them feedback. We asked students to think out loud about the meanings of their choices, such as why they chose specific numbers or why they drew a table; we asked them to write out their expressions, describe general relationships, and use structure to justify continued patterns. We encouraged students who claimed that 4 and 5 are both winning values to find a winning guess rather than be satisfied with a tie.",,

39,Empowering Mathematical Practices - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"With enough time and by working in their groups, all students improved their proficiencies in the MPs. Some students graphed the points in their tables (see fig. 7); some tables included expressions we had used to help the class see structure. Using multiple representations in the whole-class discussion allowed students to justify what they saw happening in the graph. We used their representations to focus class discussion on proficient uses of MPs and how those practices had helped us discern a new type of function, the quadratic function.",,

Adapting Heritages (2007) framework for formative assessment supplied us with a process for planning and for incorporating formative assessment throughout the lesson, which improved students proficiencies in the MPs. This process supported our lesson goals by encouraging students to use MPs to understand the concept of quadratic function and by building their conceptual understanding from seeing and explaining connections among representations they created.",,
