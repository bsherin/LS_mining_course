"When I taught reading, I frequently used literature circles to help students structure their group discussions. This reading strategy involves assigning a different role to each student in a small group as he or she reads a section of the same book. Some of the roles include Illustrator, Discussion Director, Summarizer, and Travel Tracer. This strategy allowed each student to focus on a different aspect, such as vocabulary or connections, as he or she read an assigned section in a book. When the students finished their section in the book, they would meet as a group and put all the pieces together in their  discussions. The intent of literature circles is “to allow students to practice and develop the skills and strategies of good readers” (DaLie 2001, p. 96). Literature circles are flexible and adaptable; what transpires during a group meeting depends on the book, the roles, and the students’ interactions with the materials and with one another. ",2,mtms2008-11-214a,,
"As a mathematics teacher, I have  sometimes struggled with ensuring that all students remain actively engaged in group problem-solving activities. I began wondering if the concepts found in literature  circles could be applied to my mathematics content. As a result, I developed a set of seven role sheets that would be helpful in problem-solving situations and began using them in my middle school classroom for a variety of applications. As with the various role sheets in literature circles, not all of the seven sheets need to be used simultaneously. Rather, they were designed to be used flexibly, depending on the problem and the group situation. In the sections that follow, each role sheet’s main purpose and justification are described. Examples of successful implementations of “mathematics circles” in different problemsolving situations will demonstrate the usefulness and flexibility of this strategy. The seven roles are described below. Their corresponding role sheets are in the appendix.  1. Situation Summarizer: This leadership role comes naturally to some  students who frequently take the lead in groups and enjoy presenting their findings to the class. The Situation Summarizer records or summarizes what was accomplished during group work. The sheet guides the student through the thought processes necessary to present the problem, the steps the group took to get to the solution, and the solution.",3,mtms2008-11-214a,,
"2. Vocabulary Master: Mathematics is often said to have a language of its own. For students to understand what they are being asked to do, they need to know and use correct vocabulary. The Vocabulary Master records terms that come up in group discussion that are unfamiliar and important to the solution of the problem. Although the focus of this role is on recording mathematical terms, the student may include other terms that were ",4,mtms2008-11-214a,,

"important to the problem-solving process. In addition to recording each  word and its definition, the student is required to draw a picture or give an example of the term and state the importance of the word to the problem.  3. Idea Guy or Idea Gal: Many times during an investigation, students work on an idea only to abandon it later because it did not help them find the solution. Sometimes the failure of these ideas triggers other ideas that are helpful. The purpose of this role is to record all the different ideas that were presented during the investigation and give credit to those who had the idea, similar to a brainstorming session. The student is required to determine at the end of the investigation how helpful the idea was to the group as the students solved the problem. He or she reports this by marking in the column containing a check plus, a check, or a check minus.  4. Model Maker: In mathematics, it is often helpful to draw a picture that represents the problem before one begins to try and solve it. In addition, a picture or diagram drawn at the end of an investigation can help sum up the problem and its solution. The Model Maker must be flexible so that he or she can work in either or both of  help one another as they grow more comfortable using this strategy. The following sections include examples demonstrating how the mathematics circles activity was successfully implemented in my classroom. ",6,mtms2008-11-214a,,
Word Problems,7,mtms2008-11-214a,,
"I used mathematics circles with a problem involving the Pythagorean theorem. The Model Maker, Computation Kid, and Situation Summarizer were the roles that fit the problem well and are essential components for most investigations. Students were placed in groups of three and rotated through these roles, using the correct sheets and taking turns to solve a variety of word problems that required using the Pythagorean theorem. Figure 1 lists the word problem and illustrates one group’s completed sheets. In this example, the group focused on the role of Model Maker first, with all members helping the student complete the sheet. I frequently overheard heated discussions about whether they were solving for the hypotenuse or one of the legs of the triangle. Once all members agreed on the model, the group moved confidently forward to solve the problem. The Computation Kid began calculating the answer, and the Situation Summarizer was able to accurately describe the model and how the answer was obtained. ",8,mtms2008-11-214a,,
"When not actively engaged in  completing his or her role sheet, each group member assisted the others as needed with their sheets. Figure 1’s examples show that the model depicts both the baseball diamond and the right triangle that is needed to solve the problem. In addition, the completed computation connects back to the original problem. The Situation Summarizer effectively describes the problem and the steps required to solve it.",9,mtms2008-11-214a,,
"There are several benefits to using  mathematics circles to replace indepen- these situations if needed. Although many students think that drawing a picture is easy, the thought that goes into this activity is often crucial to the success of the investigation and the presentation of the solution.",10,mtms2008-11-214a,,
"5. Computation Kid: The person in  this role is responsible for recording all required calculations on the roll sheet. Certain students will naturally gravitate toward this activity, and others will run from it. Flexibility is necessary so that the mathematics can occur without students feeling that they are being bogged down with calculations. In addition to performing and recording calculations, the student is asked to explain how he or she used the solution. This process of performing a calculation, recording the solution, and recording the use of the solution is repeated for all computations needed in the investigation.",11,mtms2008-11-214a,,
6. Connector or Link Master: The  student in this role reflects on how the current investigation links or connects to other problems that he or she has worked on or to other mathematical content areas. The student is also asked on the role sheet to make any connections between the investigation and its usefulness in the real world. This role is sometimes difficult for one student and can be completed by all  students to wrap up the investigation.,12,mtms2008-11-214a,,
7. Path Finder: The Path Finder  records the paths that the group members took to reach their solution. This role sheet could also be used as a wrap-up activity by each group member to help him or her focus on the path that the investigation took and what was learned. The Situation Summarizer could then use this information in his or her presentation.,13,mtms2008-11-214a,,

"It is difficult to give specific instructions on how best to use mathematics circles in the classroom because this activity must be tailored to your students and the investigation at hand. After experimenting with this strategy over a full school year, I have some guidelines that may help with implementation. Teachers should begin using the role sheets with word problems that have few steps. With this type of problem, students can focus on their role sheets without being  too overwhelmed with the problemsolving exercise. The role sheets  selected will vary based on the problem. Also, if students rotate through the role sheets in groups while working on problems involving similar mathematical content, they are able to  dent practice or typical group work:",15,mtms2008-11-214a,,
"Fig. 1 Student work on the Pythagorean theorem problem  the base path of a baseball diamond forms a square. if it is 90 feet from home to first base, how far does the catcher have to throw to catch someone stealing second base?  •  Students have group members to help if difficulties arise with any of the concepts.  •  Because students rotate through the different roles, they are able to practice a different skill with each problem. Instead of always performing the same role, students are required to take on different responsibilities. In so doing, they are supported by the scaffolding of the role sheets and peers.  •  This strategy helps students think  through problems. When they need to work independently, they will have developed the necessary skills to do so. ",16,mtms2008-11-214a,,
Open-Ended Situations and Problems with Multiple Paths,17,mtms2008-11-214a,,
"After students become comfortable with the various roles and how to complete the sheets while working with word problems, it is appropriate to move on to more difficult and open-ended problems. Again, the role sheets that are deemed useful will depend on the situation. You might need to provide guidance to your students to tailor the application of the role sheet to different problem types. For example, I used mathematics circles with students to pre-assess their understanding of area and perimeter. Students were placed in groups of four to five and were allowed to select which role sheet to complete. For this activity, the roles used were Situation Summarizer (to present the results), Vocabulary Master, Idea Guy or Idea Gal, Model Maker, and Computation Kid. Depending on the size of the group, some members had more than one role to perform. The groups had a fifty-minute class period to identify various examples of area and perimeter, and each student was required to complete his or role sheets. The next day, each group, lead by its Situation ",18,mtms2008-11-214a,,

"Summarizer, presented one model or example for perimeter and area.",20,mtms2008-11-214a,,
"Through the presentations and students’ written work on the role sheets, I was able to learn what my students both understood and misunderstood about area and perimeter. For instance, I learned that they had a solid understanding that area was “what was inside a shape” and that perimeter was “the distance around the outside of a shape.” I also learned that some students were confusing area with volume because of their reference to area as the amount of “water in a bathtub” or their reference to swimming pools when discussing area. Figure 2a depicts one group’s ideas and a few of the models generated for this assignment. The group found a variety of examples. The Idea Guy or Idea Gal recorded the ideas as well as the name of the student responsible for the idea. An exception is made in the last row because all the students calculated the square miles in a fictitious town—Pechtirijkereevesloveville—named after the group’s members. A few of the models are shown in figure 2b. The trapezoidal model was supposed to represent the idea in row 3 of figure 2a, which states, “You must surround someone’s trapezoid shaped backyard with trees.” Although this idea is an application of perimeter, the model includes area calculations, dividing the shape into triangles and rectangles. My students may have confused area and perimeter. However, I can also see that they had some useful strategies in place for calculating the area of shapes, even though the formulas were unknown to them. Although not all work is shown for this example, using mathematics circles provided a structured approach to brainstorming and recording students’ understanding of area and perimeter. It helped me plan my unit on surface area and volume.",21,mtms2008-11-214a,,
"The mathematics circles activity  has helped my students most with the process of solving complicated problems that may have multiple solution paths or more than one acceptable solution. Using mathematics circles for these types of problems changes the authority in the classroom. The use of the role sheets encourages my students to hold their group members responsible for their work. They have also found that they do not need to rely on the teacher as much. Before I used this strategy, students typically presented just their answers and gave minimal explanation. Since its use, students refer to many different discoveries that they found along the way. When they work on the mathematics found in complicated problems, the role sheets help them record and recall what they discover. ",22,mtms2008-11-214a,,
"In my experience, the Vocabulary Master, Path Finder, and Idea Guy or Idea Gal sheets have been particularly helpful with extensive mathematics problems, such as that in figure 3. There is a lot of mathematics in this problem, from vocabulary words to a variety of patterns. When students presented their results to the class, they were able to effectively trace the path their group took to arrive at the solution. In addition, students pointed out many different patterns that they found, not all of which were central to the problem. ",23,mtms2008-11-214a,,
"Problem solving can be valuable not only for developing new mathematical ideas but also for deepening students’ understanding of previously learned concepts (NCTM 2000, p. 256). My primary goal with the Locker problem was to introduce students to the concept of perfect squares. I discovered through their presentations that in the course of their problem solving, the students’ understanding of previously learned concepts, such as factors, multiples, primes, and composites, were also reinforced and extended.",24,mtms2008-11-214a,,

"I have used mathematics circles successfully with students when they were engaged in simple word problems, more complex problems, and open-ended investigations used to assess current understanding of concepts. One key factor in the success of mathematics circles is to train students to be flexible with the roles. The Model Maker’s role for the Pythagorean theorem problems is completely different from that used in an open-ended assessment problem, such as the area and perimeter problem. The Pythagorean theorem problem requires that the students’ models accurately reflect the problem. The Model Maker’s role for the area and perimeter assessment was to sketch models that accurately represent the concepts of area or perimeter. This open-ended approach elicits a wide variety of models, not only the one correct answer in the Pythagorean theorem problem. ",31,mtms2008-11-214a,,
"Using mathematics circles structures a mathematics task so that all students get to focus on different aspects of how to solve a problem. Students also develop the skills necessary to become better independent thinkers. In the process, I am learning much about how students think through problems. As teachers, we need to expose our students to a variety of mathematical questions and present them with strategies to help them be successful in answering them. Using mathematics circles provides both the structure and the flexibility needed to accomplish this task. If the literature circles strategy allows students to develop into good readers, then it is my hope that mathematics circles will allow students to develop into good mathematicians.",32,mtms2008-11-214a,,
