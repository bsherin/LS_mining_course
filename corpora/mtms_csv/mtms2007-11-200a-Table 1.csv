"Mathematics reminds us that communication is central to a broad range of goals in mathematics education (NCTM 2000). These goals include students’ being able to (1) organize and consolidate mathematical thinking; (2) communicate coherently with teachers, peers, and others; (3) analyze and evaluate others’ strategies; and (4) use language to express mathematics precisely. One part of communication is acquiring mathematical language and using it fluently. This article addresses learning vocabulary as one dimension of mathematics communication. ",3,mtms2007-11-200a,,
"It is not surprising that even the narrow aspect of vocabulary usage presents an array of challenges to students (Kenney et al. 2005; Miller 1993; Rubenstein and Thompson 2002; Thompson and Rubenstein 2000). For example, some words are  found only in mathematics, some words are shared with everyday English but have different meanings, and others are changed significantly by mathematical modifiers. Table 1 lists several of these vocabulary challenges with examples that can be found at the middle-grades level. ",4,mtms2007-11-200a,,
"Many authors have suggested general strategies to promote vocabulary development. These include developing concepts before introducing new terms, promoting cooperative learning, using journal writing, having students develop personal glossaries, making literature connections, implementing open-ended assessments that require explanations and justifications, and using cooperative reading (Borasi and Siegel 2000; Kenney et al. 2005; Rubenstein 1996; Rubenstein and Thompson 2002; Thompson and Rubenstein 2000; Usiskin 1996).

"Kamii and Warrington (1999) note  that of Piaget’s three kinds of knowledge (physical, social, and logicomathematical), language is social knowledge, a convention that is created by people. Although acknowledging that language is a social construct, it is also important to recognize that words have etymologies and relationships to other words that provide some reason for their having been invented or selected to represent certain mathematical ideas or entities. Highlighting these connections in our teaching may help students see some of the logic or reasons behind specific terms. This article suggests how some of this logic can come forward when teachers acknowledge the challenges that students face and incorporate some focused language strategies into teaching.

"Many terms used in mathematics are also used in everyday language, which can present a source of confusion for students. For example, for many years I was puzzled why so many students in a general pre-assessment activity responded, “True,” to the statement, “All rectangles are similar.” Finally, it dawned on me that students were thinking of the nontechnical meaning of similar. In common English, similar describes things that have some commonality. In this everyday sense, all rectangles may be considered similar because they have four right angles and opposite sides that are parallel and congruent. On the other hand, in the world of mathematics, similar has a technical meaning that is more specific. In mathematics, figures are  similar if they are identical in shape except that one is possibly a direct enlargement of the other. In effect, all corresponding angles are congruent and all corresponding linear measures are proportional. In this sense, a 4 in. × 6 in. rectangle and a 10 in. × 15 in. rectangle are similar, but a 4 in. × 6 in. and a 10 in. × 12 in. rectangle are not.",56,mtms2007-11-200a,,
"Another term with different everyday and mathematical meanings is the word difference. When asked the difference between 99 and 100, a young child responded, “Ninety-nine has two numbers, and 100 has three.” This is a difference in the common English sense but not mathematically where difference is the result when two numbers are subtracted. In a related sense, divide in everyday parlance does not mean that a whole is divided into equal parts as the word intends in mathematics. ",57,mtms2007-11-200a,,
"Another example is the word  fraction. In everyday parlance, someone might say, “I make a fraction of what Bill Gates makes.” In common language, fraction refers to a very small portion of some whole. In mathematics, in contrast, 9/10 could be a fraction, as could 20/20 or 15/4. Mathematically, a fraction need not be a value less than 1, let alone a value close to 0. ",58,mtms2007-11-200a,,
"Further difficulties arise when we  find words that are shared with science or other disciplines. For example, prism is used quite differently in the two subjects. In mathematics, a prism is a three-dimensional shape with two congruent parallel polygon faces (called bases) and parallelograms joining their corresponding points that make the lateral surfaces. In science, a prism is a piece of transparent material, often cut glass, that bends light; a pendant or a piece of a chandelier might be a prism. The shape of the prism in science may be a mathematical prism or it may be a mathematical pyramid or some other less special shape.",59,mtms2007-11-200a,,
How do we help students recognize  these nuanced differences of usage? ,60,mtms2007-11-200a,,
"One first step is being aware of the potential for confusion and being alert to words that are used differently in different realms. Next, we need to find ways to make explicit to students that words may have narrower or more specific meanings in mathematics than they do in everyday life or other disciplines. They need to see the mathematical meaning and compare it, both in terms of commonalties as well as differences, to the everyday English word. Through such conversations, students can learn the rationale behind why someone may have chosen a particular word. For example, the word median is both the center section on a divided highway and the center of a set of data when sequenced from the least to the greatest values. Both words share the meaning of “middle.” But the mathematical meaning is more precise, in that we are first sequencing our set of data, then finding the middle value or the average of the two middle-most values.

"Consider the word acute as used in everyday English (acute pain, acute vision) and as used to describe angles. How are the two meanings alike? How are they distinct? How can you help students recognize the everyday meaning and how that meaning may help them make sense of the mathematical meaning? ",63,mtms2007-11-200a,,
Words found only in mathematics,64,mtms2007-11-200a,,
"Some words are found solely within mathematics. When students encounter words like denominator, isosceles, or polynomial, they sometimes wonder, “Who thought up these hard words?” Words that are used solely within mathematics make some students believe that mathematics is a foreign language. How do we help students make sense of these terms and feel comfortable using them? One powerful strategy is to introduce students to the etymologies, or historical roots  of words. A good source for mathematical word origin explanations is Schwartzman’s The Words of Mathematics (1994). He provides a dictionary of nearly every term used at every level of mathematics, its etymology, related everyday words, a mathematical definition, and often graphics or other tools to support the understanding of meanings. He notes that “technical terms aren’t just arbitrary syllables designed to make [students’] lives more difficult” (1994, p. 1). He reveals the clues within word origins that can help students and teachers see why someone chose or created that word to describe a mathematical idea. Other sources contain specific ideas for middle school and high school teachers (Rubenstein 2000; Rubenstein and Schwartz 2000, 2002, 2003). ",65,mtms2007-11-200a,,
"Word origins provide a valuable link to the hidden meanings in words, and they help us understand why related words have the same roots. For example, denominator comes from the root for “name.” From the same root, we have nominate, which can mean “to name someone for an office.” In addition, when someone uses a misnomer, they are using a “wrong name” or “wrong word.” When we work with fractions, the denominator names the unit. For example, to understand the meaning of 3/5, we must imagine some whole that is broken into five equal parts. Each of these parts is called one-fifth. Then we need to replicate that one-fifth three times to produce three-fifths. The 5 names the unit, which is fifths, and the 3 tells how many (the number, called the numerator) of those fifths. The words denominator and numerator are far less strange when we connect them to their different roles. [Siebert and Gaskin (2006) provide an article that focuses carefully on these two basic fraction concepts of partitioning a whole (corresponding to a denomi-",66,mtms2007-11-200a,,
"Many terms used in mathematics are also used in everyday language nator) and iterating that unit fraction (corresponding to a numerator).] Another strictly mathematical  word is isosceles. It derives from the roots isos meaning “equal” and skelos meaning “leg.” Both an isosceles triangle and an isosceles trapezoid have two legs, or sides, that are equal. Students may be familiar with weatherrelated words having the same root, like isotherm, or isobar, referring to lines on a weather map that join points with the same temperature or barometric pressure. ",67,mtms2007-11-200a,,
"Polynomial, another specialized  mathematics term, is used in algebra to describe expressions like x2 + 3x + 5 or xy – 2 where two or more terms are added (or subtracted). Poly means “many” and nomial derives from a root meaning “part” or “name” (as we earlier saw in denominator). A polynomial is an expression with “many parts” or “many terms.” Related mathematical words are binomial (“having two terms”) and trinomial (“having three terms.”)",68,mtms2007-11-200a,,
"In general, sharing word origins serves many purposes. It helps students perceive a sense of history, that words and meanings have evolved over time. It helps students build their general language knowledge and word-attack skills where they may be able to use some roots that are already known to ferret out new terms. But our major goal is that word origins may support students’ making sense of mathematical terms. A suggestion for these mathematics-only words is  to focus on the meaning of the roots and to relate them to familiar English words sharing the same roots. ",69,mtms2007-11-200a,,
Challenge yourself Consider the word percent. What are the meanings of the roots of percent? What other familiar words use one or the other of the two roots? How does knowing the meanings of the roots help us make sense of the word’s meaning?,70,mtms2007-11-200a,,
Words with multiple mathematics meanings,71,mtms2007-11-200a,,
"Sometimes we find the same word, for example, round, range, or square, with distinct meanings in different strands of mathematics. Usually there is some reason why the same term is used in the different contexts. As with earlier cases, we want to help students see both the concept that links the two uses and the distinctions among them. ",72,mtms2007-11-200a,,
"Consider, for example, the term  range found both in statistics and algebra. In general, range refers to the breadth or extent of something, as in how far someone can throw a ball. In music, range describes how high or how low someone can sing. In statistics, the range of a set of data is usually the difference between the largest and the smallest values, although sometimes range refers to the interval defined by those endpoints. In algebra, the range of a function is the set of values that the function produces, the outputs of the function. What links these different ideas? The etymological root means “ring.” The word ranch, describing a large western farm, comes from the same root. So one might imagine a ring of rope or some other material that loops or encompasses all of the range of a function or a data set. ",73,mtms2007-11-200a,,
"Other examples are the words square and cube that arise in both geometry and algebra. Students are usually familiar with the shapes in geometry; with some help, they will see  the relationship to words in algebra. Algebraically, the square of 7, or 72, is the area of a square (“shape”) with edge length 7. Similarly, the cube of 7, or 73, is the volume of a cube (“shape”) with an edge length of 7. Recognizing these relationships is more than vocabulary development; these connections are important mathematical ideas in their own right. ",74,mtms2007-11-200a,,
"For those terms that have multiple  mathematical meanings, we need to recognize and acknowledge that the same word is used in two different contexts so that students will learn to use context to realize which meaning is intended. We can identify and provide meanings in both contexts but need to find the links for ourselves so that we can then help students see them. The links may arise in the origin of the word or in the mathematics itself. ",75,mtms2007-11-200a,,

Word pairs that students often confuse,78,mtms2007-11-200a,,
"Factor and multiple, radius and diameter, and combination and permutation are examples of mathematical pairs that are usually learned together and that often confuse students. One strategy to reduce confusion would be to teach one term and use it so that students are comfortable, then, several lessons later, introduce the other term; in other words, do not teach the terms together. For example, radius might be emphasized in early work with circles before diameter is introduced. Students could complete activities involving the radius of a circle, such as using a compass to draw circles with different radii and using the radii to inscribe hexagons. They could construct the perpendicular bisector of a segment and think about why  they can use the segment as the common radius of two congruent circles constructed from the endpoints as the centers of the two circles. Emphasize the root of radius, which is “ray,” and make connections to familiar words: a ray of light, the circle radiates from its center by way of its radius, and radio waves radiate. In a later lesson, students might study secants, or segments joining two points on a circle. Describe the length of the longest secant as the diameter. ",79,mtms2007-11-200a,,
"Another teaching strategy is to  acknowledge that the terms are easy to confuse and invite all students to help one another keep them straight. For example, in work with number theory, students commonly confuse factor and multiple. One teaching strategy is to emphasize that multiples are numbers found on a multiplication table; for example, multiples of 4 are 4, 8, 12, and so on and are derived from multiplying 4 by 1, 4 by 2, 4 by 3, and so on. We can also help students see the analogy to related English words, for example, that factors produce products, just as factories produce products. Despite these efforts, students often misspeak and confuse these terms. Both factor and multiple come from multiplication, and they are commonly confused. We have to help one another use the right word in the right place. Whenever the words are used, ask yourself and others to double-check the usage. ",80,mtms2007-11-200a,,

Words that sound alike,83,mtms2007-11-200a,,
"Students are sometimes confused by homonyms or near homonyms. An apple pie may be circular, but that is not why the ratio of a circle’s circumference to diameter is called pi. Pi is  a Greek letter, written π, and the first letter of the Greek word for perimeter or periphery, which corresponds to the circumference, the numerator of the ratio on which pi is based. We want students to distinguish pi and pie even though they sound alike. One strategy is to say, spell, and use the two words in context. Students might even be invited to produce cartoons in which homonyms are the source of a joke. ",84,mtms2007-11-200a,,
"Word origins, again, may be  helpful. For example, why does the complement of an angle, the amount needed to make 90 degrees, sound like compliment, telling someone they look good? Both words are derived from a root meaning “to fill.” When we find the complement of 30 degrees (which is 60 degrees), we are “filling up” the first angle so that it is a complete 90 degree angle. When we say something positive about individuals, a compliment, we are filling them up or making them feel fulfilled. ",85,mtms2007-11-200a,,
"In general, for terms that sound  alike, as in other cases, we need to say them clearly, acknowledge that other words sound the same, identify those other words, say and spell each, define them, and use each in context. ",86,mtms2007-11-200a,,
