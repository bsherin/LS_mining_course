We struggled with this question as Casie Redman (an eighthgrade math teacher) and I worked on a 90-minute lesson that focused on representing repeating decimals as fractions.

The main problem was that Redman’s eighth graders had just started learning algebra, and so gaining an understanding of the algorithm while armed with only a basic introduction to algebra was simply too difficult for them. Students  were unable to recall the algorithm or even use it correctly. They knew that they were supposed to subtract the “repeating part” but were unsure about the process. Thus, Redman sought an alternative to the standard algebraic algorithm, offering more engaging classroom opportunities.  repeating repeating repeating decimals: repeating repeating an alternative teaching approach",2,Repeating Decimals: An Alternative Teaching Approach

To help address the diverse learning needs as well as the behavioral issues that Redman observed with these students during instruction, we sought to target the process of small-group problem solving via problem posing, borrowed from The Art of Problem Posing (Brown and  Walter 2005). This process refers to the critical shift for including students as contributors not only in the problem-solving process but  also in the process of analyzing and formulating their own mathematical problems and inquiries.",5,Repeating Decimals: An Alternative Teaching Approach

Many of Redman’s students had very little experience working with repeating decimals in their home countries; therefore, before teaching this standard, she spent one 90-minute lesson going over terminating and repeating decimals, equivalent fractions, and operations on decimals and fractions. Furthermore, her students could not afford calculators and instead used an online calculator for their homework, which they often completed at school or in the library.
