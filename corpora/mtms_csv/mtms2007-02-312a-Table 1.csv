Instructional Games  with Calculators,1,mtms2007-02-312a,,
"The powerful idea of this article illustrates how to use readily available technology to enhance the learning of concepts in ways that are fun for students. It can easily be adapted to all levels, from kindergarten through calculus.",2,mtms2007-02-312a,,
"T HIS  IS  A  brIEf  COLLECTION  Of  CALCuLAtor games that I have played with kids (and adults) over the last two years. Each game can be explained simply enough for first or second graders to understand, yet the games can be played with variations difficult enough to make most mathematics teachers stop and think.",3,mtms2007-02-312a,,
"The mathematics requirements for all the games are  minimal.  Only  the  “before”  and  the  “After” games require a constant for addition and subtraction;  all  the  others  require  at  most  a  constant  for multiplication  and  division,  which  is  standard  on most small calculators. None of the games require a machine memory, and all of them can be played in less than five minutes.",4,mtms2007-02-312a,,
"The kids with whom I have played these games  have enjoyed them very much. I hope you do, too.",5,mtms2007-02-312a,,

Teaches: Addition and place value concepts For: Two players and one calculator,7,mtms2007-02-312a,,
Object of the game: To get 67 on the display,8,mtms2007-02-312a,,
"How to play: The first player pushes a single digit key (not zero), then pushes the + key. The next player takes his turn by pushing a single digit key (again not zero), then pushing the + key. Players take turns until a player pushes the + key and the display reads 67. The player who pushes + and gets the display  to show 67 wins. If a player pushes + and the display shows a number larger than 67, that player has gone “bust” and loses.",9,mtms2007-02-312a,,
"Variations for primary grades: use only the first row  of digits—the 1, 2, or 3 keys—and 21 as the goal.",10,mtms2007-02-312a,,
"Variations for junior high: use the first column of  digits—the 1, 4, or 7 keys—and go to 47.",11,mtms2007-02-312a,,

"A  word  on  the  editorial  approach  to  reprinted  articles: Obvious  typographical  errors  have  been  silently  corrected. Additions to the text for purposes of clarification appear in brackets. No effort has been made to reproduce the layouts or designs of the original articles, although the subheads are those that first appeared with the text. The use of words and phrases now considered outmoded, even slightly jarring to modern sensibilities, has likewise been maintained in an effort to give the reader a better feel for the era in which the articles were written.—Ed.",17,mtms2007-02-312a,,
"How to play: The number-giver picks a number, which  all  players  enter  into  their  calculators,  and says which digit is to be removed. Good numbers are those that have a pattern, so people can tell easily if any digit but the selected one has changed.",18,mtms2007-02-312a,,
"Example:  In the display, 876543, wipe out the 7 without changing any other digit. This is done by subtracting one number from the number on the display. So key in –, then the number to be subtracted, and press =. Does the display read 806543? ",19,mtms2007-02-312a,,
People  can  take  turns  giving  numbers  to  each  other and selecting the digit to be wiped out.,20,mtms2007-02-312a,,

"For: Any number of players and a calculator that has a constant for subtraction. (To see if the calculator will work for this game, key in 1 – = = = = =. If the answer is 0 and does not change, the calculator will not work. If the answer changes from 0 to –1 to –2 to –3 to  –4, . . . , then the calculator will work for this game.)",27,mtms2007-02-312a,,
Object of the game: To predict what number will  show on the display when = is pushed,28,mtms2007-02-312a,,
"How to play: Start the game by keying in the sequences 1 – =. Do not push C, the “clear” key, during the whole game. Check to see if the calculator is set by keying in 10 =. If the display does not read 9, something is wrong. Clear the machine and start over again. Key in a number and ask the students what number will come when the = is pushed. See who  guesses  correctly.  Keep  score  if  you  want  to make a competition out of the game.",29,mtms2007-02-312a,,
"Example:  Key  in  45.  Have  students  guess,  then push =. The result should be 44. If the game is too simple,  use  starting  numbers  of  90,  110,  or  1010. Two students can play, taking turns putting in numbers and seeing if the other can guess what will result after = is pushed.",30,mtms2007-02-312a,,
Variations for grades 4–6: Start with 10 – = or with  100 – =.,31,mtms2007-02-312a,,
Variations for junior high: use .1 – = or .01 – = as  the starting sequence. A real stumper is .05 – =.,32,mtms2007-02-312a,,
"After “After”  is  a  variation  of  “before,”  in  which  the constant is added to rather than subtracted from the number on the display. To set the calculator up, key in 1 + =, or 10 + =, or 100 + =. Then play exactly the  same as “before.”",33,mtms2007-02-312a,,
Example: Key in 1 + =. Then key in 45 and have students  guess  the  result  before  the  =  is  pushed. The result should be 46. ,34,mtms2007-02-312a,,

"Object of the game: using only the  legal  keys,  to  get  the  goal number on the display",38,mtms2007-02-312a,,
How to play: Pick a goal number and a set of “legal” keys. The game is to see who can get the answer in the fewest keystrokes.,39,mtms2007-02-312a,,
"Example: Goal number, 17, and legal keys 5, +, –, ×, ÷, or =. using only these keys, get 17. One answer would be",40,mtms2007-02-312a,,
Strategies  become more sophisticated and  generalizations develop 5 + 5 ÷ 5 = + 5 + 5 + 5 =.,41,mtms2007-02-312a,,
This solution takes 13 keystrokes. There are shorter solutions. ,42,mtms2007-02-312a,,
Pick  different  goal  numbers  or  vary  the  legal  digit.,43,mtms2007-02-312a,,
Variations for primary grades: use goal numbers  that are multiples of the legal digit.,44,mtms2007-02-312a,,
"Example: using 2 and the keys +, –, ×, ÷, or =, get 24. A first grader might do 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 . . . , until he got to 24. A shorter solution would be 22 + 2 =.",45,mtms2007-02-312a,,
Variations  for  junior  high:  use  negative  goal  numbers,46,mtms2007-02-312a,,
"Example: using 5 and +, –, ×, ÷, or =, get –3. Sophisticated solutions can be implied.",47,mtms2007-02-312a,,
"Example: using 5 and +, –, ×, ÷, or =, can you get to 26 in only ten keystrokes? (Try it before looking at the solution at the end of this article.)",48,mtms2007-02-312a,,
Target K guesses,49,mtms2007-02-312a,,
Teaches:  Decimal  place  value  and  bracketing ,50,mtms2007-02-312a,,
"For:  A  whole  class  and  a  calculator,  or  a  small  group or single student and a calculator",51,mtms2007-02-312a,,
"Object of the game: To get the target number on the display. The decimal part of the target number doesn’t count. for example, if the target is 500, a display of 500.4716 is correct.",52,mtms2007-02-312a,,
"How to play: Put a multiplication constant into the machine. (Warning: Do not clear the machine after the constant has been put in, otherwise the constant will disappear.) The object of the game is to guess what number, when multiplied by the multiplication ",53,mtms2007-02-312a,,
"VOL. 12, NO. 6  .  fEbruAr y 2007   313 constant, will give the target number.",54,mtms2007-02-312a,,
"Example:  If  the  target  number  is 500 and the multiplication constant is 17, then key in 17 × =. Make a guess, say 50 =, which gives 850—too large. Make another guess, say 20 =, which gives  340—too  small.  The  correct answer  must  be  between  20  and  50. When  students  find  that  29  =  is  too small  and  30  =  is  too  large,  they  will begin trying decimals.",55,mtms2007-02-312a,,
"Variations for primary grades: Limit the target numbers to exact multiples of the constant. for example, the target number could be 265 and the constant 5 × =. Still simpler is a target of 24 and a constant 8 × =.",56,mtms2007-02-312a,,
for ,57,mtms2007-02-312a,,
Variations  junior  high:  Pick a  small  target  number  and  a  large constant.,58,mtms2007-02-312a,,
The Big One,59,mtms2007-02-312a,,
Teaches: Decimal place value,60,mtms2007-02-312a,,
For: A small group or a single player and one calculator,61,mtms2007-02-312a,,
Object  of  the  game:  To  get  the  display to read 1,62,mtms2007-02-312a,,
"How to play: One person sets up the calculator for the player(s) without the players seeing what was put in the calculator. The calculator is set up by keying a number, then ÷ =. After the calculator is set, players guess numbers and push = until the display is 1.",63,mtms2007-02-312a,,
"Example:  Select  a  “mystery”  number  between  1  and  100—say  27.  Put it into the machine by keying 27 ÷ =. Pushing the ÷ = keys makes the number 27 a constant divisor. (Caution—do not clear the machine at any time after the mystery number has been put in or the number will be wiped out.) Give the calculator to the players, who try to guess the mystery number by keying  in  trial  numbers  and  then  pushing  =.  When  the  mystery  number  is guessed, the display will show 1 after the  =  key  is  pressed.  If  the  number tried is not correct, the display gives clues  by  showing  what  the  guess  divided by the mystery number equals.",64,mtms2007-02-312a,,
Variation  for  primary  grade:  Limit the  mystery  numbers  to  between  1 and 10.,65,mtms2007-02-312a,,
Variation for junior high: use three- digit mystery numbers.,66,mtms2007-02-312a,,
Those  are  the  games.  Here  are  a few tips on how to introduce them to a class.,67,mtms2007-02-312a,,
"Probably  the  best  introduction  is to play the game first with the entire class, or to play it with one person in front of the entire class. Even though the class cannot see the tiny digits on the  calculator  display,  you  can  read the  numbers  out  loud  to  them.  This gives the students a feel for the game that  they  cannot  get  by  just  reading the  directions  at  an  interest  center. After  the  rules  have  been  explained and  they  have  seen  the  game  played once  or  twice,  then  let  the  students play in pairs or in small groups. After they have done that for five or ten minutes,  students  should  be  able  to  play the  game  independently.  If  you  show them  the  game  without  letting  them play it immediately, they have usually forgotten the rules or lost interest by the time their turn at the interest center comes.",68,mtms2007-02-312a,,
"Although  the  kids  get  pleasure from playing any of these games just once or twice, the real benefits accrue to  a  student  after  playing  the  same game  a  number  of  times.  Strategies become  more  sophisticated  and  generalizations  develop.  So  introduce  a single game and let the students play it  briefly  but  regularly  over  a  two-  to three-week  period.  Generate  enthusiasm through contests, posted problems  about  the  game,  or  championship.  Then  introduce  another  game. This strategy allows these games to be real teaching aids, rather than simply amusing pastimes.",69,mtms2007-02-312a,,
Note: The solution to the “Solitaire” puzzle is 5 × = × = + 5 ÷ 5 =.,70,mtms2007-02-312a,,
