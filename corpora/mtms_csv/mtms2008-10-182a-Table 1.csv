"Getting a “Bee” in Mathematics Class iIn 2007, DreamWorks Animation  released Bee Movie, an animated film cowritten and produced by comedian Jerry Seinfeld. In the film, honeybee Barry B. Benson is on a quest to change his predetermined career path, namely, a life of making honey. The filmmakers used various characteristics of honeybees to create an entertaining movie. Teachers can also use facts about honeybees to create interesting mathematics activities. This article describes two activities that combine the characteristics of honeybees with important mathematical concepts. ",2,mtms2008-10-182a,,
"As an expectation for students in  grades 6–8, Principles and Standards for School Mathematics states, “All students should represent, analyze, and generalize a variety of patterns with tables, graphs, words, and, when possible, symbolic rules” (NCTM 2000, p. 222). In activity 1, students analyze the family trees of honeybees and people. A goal of this activity is for students  to discover patterns related to the number of family members at various generational levels of a family tree. Students use a combination of graphs and tables to investigate these patterns. Some students may also be able to describe these patterns algebraically.",3,mtms2008-10-182a,,
"In activity 2, students calculate the  surface area and volume of various prisms and make conjectures about which prism would be the best building block with which to construct a honeycomb. This activity relates to several geometry expectations for students in grades 6–8 (NCTM 2000, p. 232): 1.  Use two-dimensional representations of three-dimensional objects to visualize and solve problems such as those involving surface area and volume 2.  Recognize and apply geometric ideas and relationships in areas outside the mathematics classroom, such as art, science, and everyday life ",4,mtms2008-10-182a,,

In reality, however, only female honeybees have both a mother and a father. Male honeybees, called drones, have only a mother. These fascinating facts about the ancestry of bees provide the basis for an interesting activity related to pattern recognition. Students construct a bee family tree for a female honeybee and a male honeybee  and find patterns to help calculate the number of ancestors for a given generation. ",6,mtms2008-10-182a,,
"To begin, teachers may want to discuss the first few generations of Betty Bee’s family tree as shown on activity sheet 1 before having students construct several more generations. After students add several generations  to the family tree, they can make conjectures about the number of bees in each older generation and record their data in the table on the sheet. ",7,mtms2008-10-182a,,
"The numbers in the table are 1, 2, 3,  5, 8, . . . , which is a portion of the Fibonacci sequence. Hence, the number of bees in each older generation can be calculated by adding the number of bees in the two subsequent younger generations. For example, the number of great-grandparents that Betty has is equal to her number of grandparents plus her number of parents: the number of great-grandparents = the number of grandparents + the number of parents.",8,mtms2008-10-182a,,

"As an extension, teachers can have students compare the family tree of a bee with the family tree of a person, as indicated in problem 11 on activity sheet 1. The number of people in each generation of Tony’s family tree is 1, 2, 4, 8, . . . , which generate powers of 2 (20, 21, 22, 23, . . .). ",11,mtms2008-10-182a,,

"In the movie, Barry is not excited with the prospect of spending his life making honey. However, the process that real honeybees use to make honey is enthralling.

"To begin the lesson, teachers can ask students, “If you were building a honeycomb, would you want it to have gaps? Why or why not?” Teachers may have to point out that a honeycomb with gaps wastes space; therefore, it would be best not to have any wasted space. Give students tracing paper or multiple copies of activity sheet 2 so that the shapes can be cut apart. If students work in small groups, a large number of shapes can be cut out in a short amount of time. ",18,mtms2008-10-182a,,

"Once students identify the triangle, square, and hexagon as shapes that fit together without leaving gaps, teachers can introduce the term tessellation. A Great-great tessellation is created when a shape is grandmother repeated to tile a plane, without gaps or overlaps. After discussing tessellations, teachers should ask students if the three prisms in problem 3 on activity sheet 2 would tessellate (which they do).
