"We present four writing strategies that we used in our classrooms to promote reasoning, sense making, mathematical connections, and clear communication. We found that these strategies were an easy fi t with many topics we taught. Our intentional use of these four helped students explain their understanding of the procedures they used. Each strategy can be easily adapted to various topics in mathematics. ",2,mtms2013-04-492a,,

"Over time, we watched students embrace writing and become critical thinkers. They were able to organize and clearly communicate their thinking to peers and teachers.

"As math teachers, we have often encountered students who could ace a test but not explain their reasoning. This phenomenon was disturbing to us, and we fought for years to help students both understand mathematical concepts and develop meaning for them. Since our primary goal was to develop mathematically literate students, our solution was to help them explain their thinking and focus their efforts on writing. Doing this depended on expanding tools for incorporating writing into our classroom. We worked tirelessly to help students understand that writing in mathematics should consist of— •  drawings, pictures, tables, and  graphs;",7,mtms2013-04-492a,,

"that students work collaboratively in small groups because heterogeneous groups of no more than four students encourage a variety of solution methods. Once students are placed into groups, they discuss a solution to a word problem, without writing or capturing the discussion in any way.",32,mtms2013-04-492a,,
"After reaching consensus on a single solution method, the group silently writes a group report detailing their solution steps. To begin, one individual writes the first step of their solution. The paper is then passed to another member of the group to write the second step. This paper passing continues until the solution is complete. Writing in this way encourages students to clearly communicate orally, come to a consensus, read and understand the writing of their peers, and connect their thinking to the thinking of their group members. Figure 1 illustrates how two different groups in an algebra class approached the following History Club problem.",33,mtms2013-04-492a,,
"  The American History Club is taking a field trip to Philadelphia and Boston. The club has raised enough money to provide transportation and lodging for everyone.

On which day will you and your friend have exactly the same amount of money remaining? ",34,mtms2013-04-492a,,
"As an extension to word problem roulette, groups can share their methods and solution with the class, make a list of the various methods used, and then solve a similar word problem using different methods. This encourages students to use a variety of appropriate strategies to solve problems (NCTM 2000). We found that the Palette of Problems department (formerly called  the Menu of Problems) in this journal and the monthly calendar department in Mathematics Teacher were two good resources that provided a multitude of word problems that could be incorporated into our classrooms.",35,mtms2013-04-492a,,
"When initially implementing this  strategy, we were confronted with students who found it difficult to express their ideas in writing and who were unable to fully understand and appreciate the thinking of their peers. Word problem roulette helped overcome these challenges by requiring that students connect their thinking to that of their classmates. Over time, students became comfortable with this strategy, were able to expand their thoughts to incorporate ideas from others, and learned to view multiple solution approaches to the problems that were presented.",36,mtms2013-04-492a,,
strategy 2: three-way tie,37,mtms2013-04-492a,,
"An instructional strategy called threeway tie, described by Silver, Brunsting, and Walsh (2008), asks students to formulate their thinking and understanding of mathematical terms and concepts through a triangle-shaped organizational tool. From three separate but interrelated terms, such as distance formula, coordinate plane, and Pythagorean theorem, students write at least one sentence describing how a pair of words is connected along each side of the triangle. Then they write a summary describing the relationship among the three terms in the interior of the triangle (see  fig. 2). Additional term triples to promote students’ understanding of relationships among mathematical topics are listed in figure 3.",38,mtms2013-04-492a,,
"The three-way tie can be adapted  in various ways. Once students are comfortable with the strategy, they can select their own three terms from a given unit and exchange them with classsmates. This process can also be reversed. The teacher can provide the ",39,mtms2013-04-492a,,
Fig. 3 Teachers can use the following sets of terms to promote students’ understanding of relationships among topics within mathematics.,40,mtms2013-04-492a,,
• Slope-intercept form – Domain/Range – Function • Horizontal slope – y-intercept – Direct variation • Slope-intercept form – Point-slope form – Standard form •  Greatest Common Factor (GCF) – Least Common Multiple (LCM) – Prime  factorization • Median – Interquartile range (IQR) – Box-and-whisker plot • Rational numbers – Integers – Natural numbers • Permutation – Combination – Factorial,41,mtms2013-04-492a,,
"Fig. 4 Given descriptions in a triangular organization tool, students can determine the terms being described and provide additional information.",42,mtms2013-04-492a,,
"relationship among three unknown terms, and students can fill in the terms and write a summary detailing how the three are connected (see  fig. 4). Additionally, students can present their three-way tie to the class, orally explaining and defending their thinking.",43,mtms2013-04-492a,,
strategy 3: cinquain,44,mtms2013-04-492a,,
"A cinquain is a five-line poetic structure that promotes student writing in mathematics (Fisher and Frey 2004). Writing a cinquain can help students consider a mathematical concept in its entirety, grasp the main ideas related to that concept, and summarize this  information briefly. Through this written representation, students are directed to think about the details and critical information of mathematical concepts.",45,mtms2013-04-492a,,
"Encouraging students to write a cinquain, without the aid of textbooks or notes, can support a deeper understanding of key vocabulary and concepts. As Alvermann, Gillis, and Phelps (2012, p. 243) assert, “Much of the vocabulary learned in content areas requires procedural knowledge, or being able to do things with a concept, to apply it in combination with other ideas.” Writing a cinquain helps students develop the procedural ",46,mtms2013-04-492a,,

Figure 5a displays one possible format for a cinquain; fi gure 5b shows a student’s perception of algebra as a cinquain. ,52,mtms2013-04-492a,,
"Students can work as a class to write a cinquain on the same topic, choose their own topic, or be given individual topics. The latter approach can then be used as a guessing game. Individually, students can read their cinquain to the class, leaving out the fi rst line, and the class can be asked to guess the topic. Students can also exchange cinquains with their peers and write a brief paragraph expanding on the ideas presented in the other poems. Another alternative is to present students with separate elements that they must then arrange into a coherent cinquain. Figure 6a contains multiple elements that can challenge students to select and arrange in a coherent manner, thus allowing them to demonstrate their understanding of the mathematical concept. Figure 6b shows student work.",53,mtms2013-04-492a,,
strategy 4: M + M: Math and MetaPhors,54,mtms2013-04-492a,,
"The instructional strategy called M + M: Math and Metaphors (Silver, Brunsting, and Walsh 2008) challenges students to compare a mathematical concept to an everyday concept or object. In Classroom Instruction That Works (2001), Marzano, Pickering, and Pollock claim that the use of metaphors is a “highly robust activity”  that helps students make meaningful connections to their everyday lives.",55,mtms2013-04-492a,,
"When students are able to create an appropriate metaphor for a mathematical topic, they are demonstrating their understanding of that topic. We used this writing strategy to help students review major ideas discussed in class. Collecting and reading students’ metaphors gave us great insight into students’ knowledge of mathematical concepts and allowed us to adapt our instruction to meet students’ needs.",56,mtms2013-04-492a,,
Figure 7’s student work pertains to a lesson on inequalities.,57,mtms2013-04-492a,,
The following questions can be used to help students connect mathematics to their lives:  •  How is the coordinate plane like  the map of the world? •  How is factoring like digesting  food? •  How is the order of operations like a recipe for chocolate chip cookies? •  How is solving equations like  skateboarding? •  How are proportions like a seesaw? •  How is graphing a line like a road  map? •  How is the real number system like  the United States of America?,58,mtms2013-04-492a,,

There are multiple approaches and  variations of this strategy. Students may be allowed to construct one portion of the metaphor (“How is a function like a ______________?”) or prepare their own metaphor within the constraint of a lesson or a unit.,73,mtms2013-04-492a,,
"An interesting adaptation is to take objects from the home or classroom, place them in a bag, and allow each student to select one randomly. For example, when studying probability, students in groups of three selected items such as an umbrella, a key, a  rock, a miniature baseball bat, and a plastic egg from a bag. Groups then created a list of ideas relating their selected object to probability and wrote their ideas on poster boards, which were posted in the room to invoke classroom discussion.",74,mtms2013-04-492a,,
"Working collaboratively to generate ideas helped students build on and connect to their prior knowledge before writing a metaphor. Figure 8 showcases two different group approaches to this task.

"Initially, our students resisted writing in math class. Expanding their understanding of what constitutes writing in math helped us overcome this chal- lenge. The more practice the students had with writing in math class, the less opposition we encountered. We used writing strategies like these at least once per week. In the beginning, we had to allow students most of the class period to complete such tasks. As students gained experience, they required less time to complete the assignments, and more attention was focused on the resulting mathematical discussions. We adapted and used each of these strategies throughout different units of study as a way to assess student understanding and adjust our instruction accordingly. Using these strategies as assessments for learning tools served us and the students; prompt and specific feedback about their writing helped motivate students and improve their understanding of the topics being discussed.",77,mtms2013-04-492a,,
"Our goal was to develop mathematically literate students who could  effectively communicate their understanding and ideas. Using similar writing strategies frequently and consistently helped us accomplish our goal; writing helped our students clarify their thoughts and helped them build connections between mathematical content and their lives. These strategies made writing a foundation in our math classrooms and promoted an environment that encouraged sense making, connections, collaboration, and communication between students and teachers. ",78,mtms2013-04-492a,,
"We recognize that there is no  one-size-fits-all approach to writing in mathematics. Rather, we hope that other math teachers will find this information useful and will intentionally adapt these strategies and incorporate them in their classrooms. In doing so, writing will encourage students to build on their prior knowledge and make connections that will lead to a ",79,mtms2013-04-492a,,
