0,Zero Pairs_ Learning about Additive Inverses - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Throughout elementary school, students learn about positive numbers and how they fit on a number line. The transition to using negative numbers, after only working with numbers greater than zero for several years, can be difficult for students (Murray 1985). The card game described here was used successfully with fifth graders; through the game, students explore the characteristics of numbers less than zero and how to add positive and negative numbers. The games design allows for students to notice patterns and build their knowledge of negative numbers. The activity addresses the following goals from NCTM (2000):",,
1,Zero Pairs_ Learning about Additive Inverses - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Explore numbers less than 0 by extending the number line (gr. 35),,
2,Zero Pairs_ Learning about Additive Inverses - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Describe classes of numbers according to characteristics (gr. 35),,
3,Zero Pairs_ Learning about Additive Inverses - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Develop meaning for integers and represent and compare quantities with them (gr. 68),,
4,Zero Pairs_ Learning about Additive Inverses - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Understand and use the inverse relationships of addition (gr. 68),,
5,Zero Pairs_ Learning about Additive Inverses - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"This article follows the structure of a Launch, Explore, and Summary lesson.",,
6,Zero Pairs_ Learning about Additive Inverses - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,LAUNCH,,
7,Zero Pairs_ Learning about Additive Inverses - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The beginning of the lesson involves a short, ten-minute whole-class interaction to introduce the topic and capture students interest. As a visual aid, use a number path that stretches from approximately 10 to 10 (see fig. 1), and indicate that all movements start from zero for the equations. Ask students in which direction they will move when adding positive numbers (to the right, or in the positive direction); use this question as well to help them think about which direction to move for negative numbers. Modeling multiple examples with their input should help students recognize that when adding two integers, they are making two movements on the number line, and that the movements depend on what numbers are being added (e.g., 5 + 3 means moving five spaces to the left and three spaces to the right). Students should begin to see a structure.",,
8,Zero Pairs_ Learning about Additive Inverses - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
9,Zero Pairs_ Learning about Additive Inverses - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"As you see their understanding growing, start showing zero pairs, such as 5 + 5 and 3 + 3. Their placement on the number line will end at zero after the two movements. At this point, introduce the idea of Zero Pairs (or additive inverses) and prompt students to think of more Zero Pairs to fully set the stage for the game.",,
10,Zero Pairs_ Learning about Additive Inverses - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,EXPLORE,,
11,Zero Pairs_ Learning about Additive Inverses - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Stand at the front of the class and go through the instructions step-by-step in a mock game with one student. Remind students to communicate at the beginning and end of all turns what they are doing to show their thought processes.,,
12,Zero Pairs_ Learning about Additive Inverses - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The necessary materials per pair of students are one die marked with 4, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1 (see activity sheet 1), one deck of twenty cards labeled 1, and one deck of twenty cards labeled 1 (see activity sheet 2). Students are to follow these general rules for the game:",,
13,Zero Pairs_ Learning about Additive Inverses - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"1.  Find a partner with whom you will play the game. Start with no cards in your hands. At the beginning of each turn, you will tell your partner how much your card hand adds up to. For the first turn, you will say, I have zero.",,
14,Zero Pairs_ Learning about Additive Inverses - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"2.  The younger of the two partners rolls the die first; thereafter players alternate turns. The die will tell you how many cards should be drawn from the decks, for example, a roll of 4 means that the player will draw four cards labeled with a negative sign, or .",,
15,Zero Pairs_ Learning about Additive Inverses - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"3.  After picking up the correct number of negative or positive cards, tell your partner what you are adding. These are called integer addition sentences, such as 0 plus 4 is 4. You will not be able to make a zero pair on the first turn because no cards are in your hand.",,
16,Zero Pairs_ Learning about Additive Inverses - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"4.  Hand the die to your partner, and repeat the process.",,
17,Zero Pairs_ Learning about Additive Inverses - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"5.  As the game progresses, you should be able to make zero pairs to discard. For example, for every 1, you can combine a +1 to discard. [See fig. 2 for examples of questions to ask students as they play the game.]",,
18,Zero Pairs_ Learning about Additive Inverses - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
19,Zero Pairs_ Learning about Additive Inverses - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"6.  The game ends when one player successfully gets rid of all the cards in his or her hand and says, I have zero.",,
20,Zero Pairs_ Learning about Additive Inverses - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,POSSIBLE STUDENT RESPONSES,,
21,Zero Pairs_ Learning about Additive Inverses - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"When working with students who were playing the game, we found the following types of responses to be typical:",,
22,Zero Pairs_ Learning about Additive Inverses - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Pairs only: Some students will only make pairs of 1 and +1. Even when larger combinations are possible, these students consecutively match only pairs of +1 and 1. This technique allows for fewer mistakes as they discard in simple pairs. After a while, students might change this technique and make larger zero pairs, as in combinations.",,
23,Zero Pairs_ Learning about Additive Inverses - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Combinations: These students add multiple +1 and 1 cards to create integers with larger absolute values and can articulate that three 1 cards total 3, which will cancel out a hand of three +1 cards.",,
24,Zero Pairs_ Learning about Additive Inverses - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Thinking ahead: Students may think ahead and realize what roll will be most helpful (e.g., a student has three 1 cards and knows that he or she will need to roll a +3 to cancel all). Rather than drawing cards from the pile, students will think ahead to the result and discard what they can. For example, if they have cards worth 3 and roll 2, they will discard two negatives without drawing any cards.",,
25,Zero Pairs_ Learning about Additive Inverses - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,POSSIBLE STRUGGLES,,
26,Zero Pairs_ Learning about Additive Inverses - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,We found that students experienced several fairly common struggles:,,
27,Zero Pairs_ Learning about Additive Inverses - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Collecting cards: During the game, we found that some students did not discard zero pairs properly or at all. They needed a reminder to cancel out by making zero pairs with +1 and 1. Some students thought that they could discard only one pair for each turn. They need to be reminded to make multiple discards or to group their cards to create new zero pairs to discard.",,
28,Zero Pairs_ Learning about Additive Inverses - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Not enough cards: Students ran out of cards if they rolled only positives or only negatives consecutively. In this case, allow students to reuse cards that they previously discarded as zero pairs to keep the game going. In extreme cases, we allowed them to start over.",,
29,Zero Pairs_ Learning about Additive Inverses - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Addition sentences: Students struggled with using addition sentences correctly. Ask them to think about the cards in their hands. They might need to see different possible solutions: proper pairings, a number line, or sentences written down. Another solution may be to  allow their partner to help them keep track.",,
30,Zero Pairs_ Learning about Additive Inverses - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Correct terminology: Students sometimes used the word minus in their addition sentences or when talking about negatives. Because this exercise is meant to enhance students understanding of negative and positive numbers, remind them throughout the card game to structure their sentences in the form of these examples:",,
31,Zero Pairs_ Learning about Additive Inverses - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"2 + 2 = 0 or 2 + 2 = 0,",,
32,Zero Pairs_ Learning about Additive Inverses - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,instead of,,
33,Zero Pairs_ Learning about Additive Inverses - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,minus 2 + 2 = 0 or 2 minus 2 = 0.,,
34,Zero Pairs_ Learning about Additive Inverses - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,SUMMARIZE PATTERNS OF PLAY,,
35,Zero Pairs_ Learning about Additive Inverses - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"After students clean up the game, have them share what patterns they found for making zero pairs and what different strategies they used. Make a short list of some zero pairs that the students made during the game. Answer any questions that they might have about zero pairs. Present hypothetical card hands, and have students indicate which cards they would need to create a zero pair (e.g, If I have 5 in my hand, what do I need to create a zero pair and get rid of all my cards?). Emphasize that zero pairs result from adding a number and its additive inverse together.",,
36,Zero Pairs_ Learning about Additive Inverses - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,EXTENSIONS,,
37,Zero Pairs_ Learning about Additive Inverses - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,These extensions will allow the teacher to further assess and challenge students:,,
38,Zero Pairs_ Learning about Additive Inverses - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
39,Zero Pairs_ Learning about Additive Inverses - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Recording progress: Aside from saying the addition sentences during the game, students can be assessed on their knowledge as well as how well they kept track of all their card hands on the extension sheet called Card Game: Zero Pairs (see fig. 3). This sheet is meant to help students show their thought processes. For example, results might show that more students think about zero pairs by grouping their cards than individual pairing, which might help with further instruction. It might also reveal difficulties with thinking about the addition problems. Figure 4 shows a completed recording sheet.",,
40,Zero Pairs_ Learning about Additive Inverses - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Fig. 4 This example of a completed recording sheet shows the cards drawn and students associated moves.,,
41,Zero Pairs_ Learning about Additive Inverses - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
42,Zero Pairs_ Learning about Additive Inverses - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Additional cards: To challenge students, especially in sixth and seventh grades, mix in higher-value cards, such as 4, 3, 2, 5. Mix all the cards, have students draw two to three cards to start, and have students draw one card at a time thereafter (no dice are needed). The additional values will force students to group cards in different ways to make zero pairs, which will be more challenging. When adding more cards to the decks, try not to make the cards too high in value; the high value cards might prolong the game beyond the time allotted for it. See activity sheet 3 for a blank card template.",,
43,Zero Pairs_ Learning about Additive Inverses - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Stories: This extension is for sixth graders and seventh graders. Whenever students make a zero pair, ask them to present to their partner a story that represents the problem (e.g., temperatures increasing or decreasing). Students could also create stories to represent the cards that are in their hands. After playing the game, have students share their stories and invite the rest of the class to write equations that match the stories.",,
44,Zero Pairs_ Learning about Additive Inverses - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,BENEFITS TO BREAKING APART NUMBERS,,
45,Zero Pairs_ Learning about Additive Inverses - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"This lesson helps students develop an understanding of zero pairs, or additive inverses, in a fun and straightforward way while learning about integer addition. By the end of the game, students will have constructed their own ideas through active learning and will be able to explain zero pairs. Students can use their understanding of zero pairs to solve other addition problems by breaking apart numbers to make zero pairs. For example, to solve 5 + 3, students could break apart 5 into 3 and 2, cancel 3 and 3, and end up with 2. This idea can be explored in the extensions and through additional explorations.",,
