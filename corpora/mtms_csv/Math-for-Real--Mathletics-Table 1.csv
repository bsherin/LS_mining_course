3,Math for Real: Mathletics Training Camp,"Four friends—Jay, Nadine, Shelly, and Kieran—are lifting weights at the Mathletics Training Center. One exercise requires the use of a bar that weighs 45 pounds (lbs.). Extra weights—a 5 lb., a 10 lb., a 25 lb., and  a 45 lb.—can be placed on this bar. However, the bar must always be loaded evenly, in other words, the same arrangement of weights need to be placed on each side. ",3,Math for Real: Mathletics Training Camp
4,Math for Real: Mathletics Training Camp,"PROBLEMS 1.  Jay warms up using the 25 lb.  weights. How much weight is he lifting in total? 2.  Nadine wants to lift 135 lbs.  Including the 45 lb. bar, what  are the possible ways that she can create 135 lbs. to lift?  3.  Shelly wants to lift fewer than  150 lbs. but more than 100 lbs. What values can she use to do this?

Manuscripts should show how math is used to solve a real-life problem, preferably in the context of one’s profession, and should be no more than 300 words. Submit manuscripts through http://mtms.msubmit.net.  4.  Kieran works through several  weight-lifting sets.  a.  For set 1, he loads eight   10 lb. weights on each side of the bar. How much weight  is he lifting?  b.  For set 2, he removes a   10 lb. weight from each side  of the bar. How much is he  lifting now? c.  For set 3, he again removes a  10 lb. weight from each side. How much is he lifting now?   the weights? Use the equation you wrote for problem 4d to  determine the weight that  Kieran will lift on set 7. ",5,Math for Real: Mathletics Training Camp
