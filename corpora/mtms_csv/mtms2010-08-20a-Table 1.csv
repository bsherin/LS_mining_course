That’s not going to happen.” ,7,mtms2010-08-20a,,
"My students seemed to have a  negative attitude about math. In giving that stirring motivational speech, I apparently overlooked one important point: Students and adults tend to shy away from situations in which failure is probable. Failure can often deal a devastating blow to the fragile psyche of an adolescent. Since feelings of inadequacy are never pleasurable,  the chance that these students would voluntarily choose to spend additional time on math was highly unlikely. After some careful reflection, I determined two reasons why my students were reluctant to attend the school’s math lab. It seemed to be a vicious cycle. Students who did not enjoy math did not want to spend any additional time working on it. Since they did not spend time with ",8,mtms2010-08-20a,,
Making Math Matters Work for You,9,mtms2010-08-20a,,
Anyone can set up math matters and spread the joy of learning about math. here are some practical guidelines.   1. Find a place to meet.,10,mtms2010-08-20a,,
 2. choose your materials.  3. stay away from toys and games that have no learning value.  4. Ensure that set-up and clean-up are quick and easy.,11,mtms2010-08-20a,,
 5. Ask school personnel for support.,12,mtms2010-08-20a,,

"11. schedule it for early mornings.  math, they were not as proficient as they should be. Since they were not as proficient as they should be, they did not enjoy it. ",16,mtms2010-08-20a,,
"First, most of these students did  not believe in their own mathematical capabilities. The way in which individuals judge their own capabilities strongly influences both behavior as well as motivation (Bandura 1986). I also knew that all my students needed to be involved in mathematical experiences as much as possible, especially those who found the subject to be difficult. When given a choice, these students would choose anything but math, maybe because they did not feel it was worth the time and investment.",17,mtms2010-08-20a,,
"Second, the math-lab format was  not appealing to sixth graders. Increasing numbers of students each year could have benefited from extra math help, yet they consistently refused to ask. My middle school offers two math labs each morning. Two math teachers on staff are available in a central location to answer questions or simply help with homework. Although  students often arrived at school early enough, most who needed at least some help in math did not want to attend the labs. Many of these students were also unsuccessful in passing their last state achievement test. ",18,mtms2010-08-20a,,
"I wanted to find out why students who needed help would not ask for it when it was available. Embracing the challenge, I silently wondered: 1.  Would I be able to make a personal  connection that would make a difference in their application of mathematics and also strengthen their personal belief that they could succeed? 2.  Was it possible to design a mathematical environment that was so alluring it could compete with their other morning activities?  3.  Could I provide any activity that  would make my sixth graders leave the gym each morning thinking, “Let’s go see our math teacher”? ",19,mtms2010-08-20a,,
"With those thoughts in mind, Math Matters was born.",20,mtms2010-08-20a,,
PREscRiPtion nEEdEd:  sElf-EfficAcY,21,mtms2010-08-20a,,
"At least the problem was consistent. Each year, a large portion of my sixth graders frequently wrote in their journals that they did not enjoy math: “I feel dumb in math,” “Tests make me nervous,” and “I know I can’t do it, so I don’t want to try.” It seemed that students either loved math or hated math. I needed to get to the crux of the matter and turn the tide for the sake of their future learning. ",22,mtms2010-08-20a,,
"I found that there was an underlying issue at work. When people believe that they are able to accomplish a given task, they persist at it, focus on it, and envision success. This personal belief is called self-efficacy. My students needed to believe in their abilities, persevere in challenging tasks, and envision themselves as lifelong mathematicians. People are much more likely to engage in certain behaviors when they believe they are capable of executing those behaviors successfully than when those beliefs are noticeably absent (Bandura 1986). In fact, House (2000) found a direct correlation between the level of a student’s self-efficacy and the level of his or her achievement. ",23,mtms2010-08-20a,,
"Three reasons, based on research and theory, needed to be addressed with my students.  1. Self-efficacy is particularly critical to the young adolescent because middle school is a time of change. Peer and  social pressures, along with the stronger demands of academics, can cause self-doubt and uneasiness. Adolescents should be finding ways to cultivate a respect for themselves and for their own learning capabilities while they deal with their changing realities. Bruner (1996) noted just how harsh school can sometimes be on a young psyche. He argued that students’ self-esteem develops out of what they believe themselves capable ",24,mtms2010-08-20a,,
Self-efficacy in math is critical to young adolescents as they develop the ability to  persevere in the face of difficulties.,25,mtms2010-08-20a,,
of and from what they fear may be beyond their own capabilities.,26,mtms2010-08-20a,,
"2. Self-efficacy is critical to the young adolescent because it is connected to mathematics achievement (Hannula and Malmivuori 1997). Tartre and Fennema (1995) described self- efficacy as a key player in the learning of math. Their study indicated that self-efficacy is not only important for the immediate accumulation of knowledge but is also an important predictor for future development. Multon, Brown, and Lent (1991) found the correlation between self-efficacy and achievement to be so strong that it was even highly predictive of undergraduates’ choice of major. Bandura (1986) argued that the effort a student invests in a difficult learning task is directly linked to self-efficacy. ",27,mtms2010-08-20a,,
"For instance, when a student feels that it is possible for him or her to find a solution to a problem and when that problem has personal relevance, he or she is more likely to persist and put forth the effort needed to reach a satisfactory conclusion. However, when it is felt that a successful solution is completely out of reach, he or she will often simply give up, feeling the reward may not be worth the effort. ",28,mtms2010-08-20a,,
"Just as schools begin to introduce  adolescents to algebraic concepts, self-efficacy becomes a critical part of the learning process since students may already be struggling through the developmental stages of merging concrete and abstract thinking.",29,mtms2010-08-20a,,
"3. Self-efficacy is critical to the young adolescent because believing in one’s ability to perform a task has been shown to predict learning. Pajares and Miller (1994) found self-efficacy to be more important than either gender or background, meaning that a student’s personal belief in his or her own capabilities is of the utmost importance. A teacher should be aware of this and search for opportunities to validate students’ feelings to set the foundation for increased achievement. ",30,mtms2010-08-20a,,
"I needed to find ways to allow students to develop the belief that they could succeed in mathematics. This would, in turn, lead to perseverance and greater mathematics achievement. I suddenly saw myself in a unique position. Even as the subject matter increased in difficulty, I might be able to help— 1.  my students develop greater self- efficacy; and 2.  make a positive and lasting impact  on students’ self-perceptions.

"During the first week of school, I invited all my students to come in thirty minutes before the first bell and play some math games. In our school, students are required to first report to the gym or cafeteria. With extra time on their hands, I rationalized that they might as well be encouraged to find a useful way to spend that time. My goal was for the students to be exposed to a free space where collabo- ration, as well as peer learning and teaching, could take place. ",33,mtms2010-08-20a,,

Integer War is played with a regular deck of cards and can teach many math skills. Using red cards for negative integers and black cards for positive ones, students draw cards and determine which is greater or draw cards and add or multiply the integers. I also borrowed Fraction Bingo and foam fraction circle packets from our school’s resource room. Figure 1 lists a few of the math activities that can be used. ",35,mtms2010-08-20a,,

"For four days, no one appeared, so I began formulating plan B. It would start with a sweep of the gym the next morning to entice my students to follow me to my classroom. The lure of laptops ought to do it. However, as it turns out, I did not need plan B. On the fifth day, a student sheepishly walked through the door. I told her I was thrilled she had chosen to come and asked what help she needed. Homework became the hook. The student asked for help on some homework problems, so we took care of that first.

Most were struggling with subtraction of integers, so I invited them to retrieve a small white marker board and a marker. “Pull up a chair,” I said. “Let’s see what questions you have.” Within ten minutes, I could see a change.

"Word spread that fun things were going on in room 120 before school and that they could get homework help. In one week, fifteen students were  appearing. I borrowed an Allowance game from a teacher friend and also used a math matching activity that I had made from construction paper, based on new vocabulary we were learning. Writing a vocabulary word on a giant piece of paper and a matching phrase on another, students practiced their vocabulary skills and could self-check. I even used a giant checkers game that I had purchased from a trip to a Cracker Barrel restaurant. I began to set up StudyJams! a Web-based service that uses video  karaoke and tutorials to teach math concepts. Students can log on to watch short videos about various mathematical subjects, using headphones to keep the noise level to a minimum.

"This became a favorite place for the students to go since the cartoons creatively held their attention while math skills were being taught. I began to spend more time searching for new and different math activities while trying to stay away from Web sites that were only about play.
