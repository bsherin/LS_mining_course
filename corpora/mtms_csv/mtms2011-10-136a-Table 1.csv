Three Heads Are  Better Than One  Shirley M. Matteson,1,mtms2011-10-136a,,
"Mathematics teachers and students have had increasing pressure placed on them concerning performance on local, state, national, and international mathematics assessments. In general, assessments have several purposes, such as helping teachers (a) make instructional decisions, (b) monitor students’ progress, (c) evaluate students’ achievement, and (d) appraise instructional programs (Powell 2005, p. 240). However, the “main goal is to advance students’ learning and inform teachers as they make instructional strategies” (NCTM 1995, p. 13).",2,mtms2011-10-136a,,
"As a middle school mathematics teacher, I struggled to find an effective way for students to learn from the problems they missed on major exams. There had to be a better way than asking students to sit at their desks and individually rework problems using class notes or the textbook or methodically write in answers while I discussed each test item. To effectively reteach concepts, I needed to know what students were thinking as they worked through the problems.",3,mtms2011-10-136a,,

I once heard a foreign language  teacher discuss how her students worked through test corrections. The strategy required students to work collaboratively in groups of two or three. I call my adaptation of her strategy Three Heads Are Better ,6,mtms2011-10-136a,,

"Because implementing Three Heads may take a class period or more to complete, I use it only occasionally, such as after a major exam. However, I do not tell students that a certain test will be a Three Heads exam. The activity works well with multiplechoice tests for which students transfer answers to a scanned answer document. However, it can also be used with open-ended exams in which students transfer final responses to a one-answer document, such as a grid format or numbered sheet. To understand what students are thinking as they solve the problems, encourage them to record all work.",10,mtms2011-10-136a,,

"Imagine that your students have completed a major unit and are ready for the exam. They work through the assessment individually and transfer solutions to the answer document. The following steps should occur before implementing the Three Heads strategy, which I try to schedule the day after the exam. ",12,mtms2011-10-136a,,
"Phase 1: Analysis of Test Results and Group Formation 1.  Score the answer document, but  do not mark on the students’ work document or write the test grade. If you provide too much information, such as where they were successful or had problems, students tend to skip to the problems they missed, and any opportunity for deeper learning will be lost.  2.  Sort the test scores from lowest  to highest and run descriptive statistics for each class: minimum ",13,mtms2011-10-136a,,
"What three heads May sound like The following are typical exchanges that you might overhear during a Three Heads activity. Students are discussing this problem and the following answer choices:   What is the area of a rectangle, in square centimeters, that has a length of 5 centimeters and a perimeter of 18 centimeters? a. 90 cm2 b. 65 cm2 c. 40 cm2 d. 20 cm2",14,mtms2011-10-136a,,
"Juan: Ok, what did you get?",15,mtms2011-10-136a,,
Carlotta: C.,16,mtms2011-10-136a,,
Stacey: A.,17,mtms2011-10-136a,,
"Juan: So did i, that’s 2 to 1, so the answer is A.",18,mtms2011-10-136a,,
Carlotta: But i have C.,19,mtms2011-10-136a,,
"Juan: Look, two of us have A, so that has to be the answer.",20,mtms2011-10-136a,,
Carlotta: How did you get that? i don’t see any work on your paper.,21,mtms2011-10-136a,,
Juan: i did it in my head. Just multiplied 5 × 18 and got 90.,22,mtms2011-10-136a,,
"Stacey: That’s what i have. it’s right here on my paper. Besides, area is   length × width, and i multiplied to get my answer.",23,mtms2011-10-136a,,
"Carlotta: Ok, i get that you multiplied and that 5 is the length, but the 18 is  the perimeter, not the length.",24,mtms2011-10-136a,,
"Stacey: She’s right, 18 is the perimeter. [Stacey looks on the formula chart.] Let’s see, the formula for perimeter is 2 lengths and 2 widths, but how do we find the width when they don’t tell us what it is? ",25,mtms2011-10-136a,,
"The three students look puzzled. i wonder if i should step in to redirect them but decide to let them figure out a strategy on their own. i then move to Craig, keran, and Matt, who are huddled together having an animated conversation, but make a mental note to check on Stacey, Juan, and Carlotta later.",26,mtms2011-10-136a,,
"Keran: . . . so i drew a rectangle. See, i put 5 here on this side. We know that  across from that is another 5, which is what i have here. So far we have 10 out of the 18. ",27,mtms2011-10-136a,,
Craig: And 18 minus 10 leaves 8. So 8 times 5 is 40! Told you that C was right! [He raises his hand to accept a high-five from his group members.],28,mtms2011-10-136a,,
"Keran: But that’s 8 for both widths, not just one. [Craig drops his hand.]",29,mtms2011-10-136a,,
Craig: Oh!,30,mtms2011-10-136a,,
"Matt: Now i get it. it’s not 8 plus 8, because that would be 16 to add to the 10.",31,mtms2011-10-136a,,
"Keran: And the perimeter is only 18, not 26. Matt: Since there are two widths, i need two of the same number, uh, widths  that will add up to 8.",32,mtms2011-10-136a,,
"Keran: So, you’ll divide the 8 by 2. That gives you a width of 4. So now you  have 5 plus 5 plus 4 plus 4, or the 18 for the perimeter.",33,mtms2011-10-136a,,
"Craig: Which means the length is 5 and the width is 4, or 5 times 4 is   20 centimeters square. Man! i’ve got to slow down and start showing  work!",34,mtms2011-10-136a,,
Matt: i didn’t get it at all until i saw keran’s picture. ,35,mtms2011-10-136a,,
"As i head back to check on the progress of Stacey, Juan, and Carlotta, i consider ways to incorporate other representations and solution strategies in presenting new mathematical concepts to this class. i also mentally note that keran, who is generally quiet in class, has a much stronger understanding of both area and perimeter than his partners.",36,mtms2011-10-136a,,
"and maximum scores, the range, and the mean. Complete an item analysis, which you will use to determine the specific test item conversations to monitor.",37,mtms2011-10-136a,,
"3.  Use the test scores to determine how to form small groups of students who have very similar scores. Consider students’ temperaments, language skills, IEPs, and prior assessment performance when creating groups. From my experience, students generally work harder in groups in which no one individual seems to be an expert. ",38,mtms2011-10-136a,,
"Activity Guidelines and Disclosure of Descriptive Statistics 1.  Introduce the guidelines concerning group interactions, noise level, and what each group needs to turn in at the end of class, such as any calculations, drawings, or graphs. Be prepared to actively reinforce and monitor these guidelines. Keep in mind that you are relinquishing the control of the class to the students during this activity.",39,mtms2011-10-136a,,
"2.  Give students the descriptive statistics for their class. For example, maximum grade = 92, range = 50, and mean = 66. I prefer to have students interpret the data provided. Students in upper grade levels could interpret the data from a box-and-whisker plot; a histogram of the scores; or a list of the As, Bs, and Cs in the class.  3.  Describe how the retest will be  scored and recorded in the grade book. Averaging scores, replacing a grade, or awarding extra points are possible choices. ",40,mtms2011-10-136a,,
Phase 2: The Three Heads Activity 1.  Return each group member’s original work document and one blank answer document for the group. Group members are to write their names on the blank answer sheet.,41,mtms2011-10-136a,,
"2.  Ask each group to work through  every problem from the assessment and record one set of responses on the answer document. The group must reach consensus on the final answer. If members cannot reach consensus, the group may skip that item and return to it later. If it is left blank at the end of the activity, it will be scored as incorrect.  3.  Prohibit groups from asking for outside help on a problem. Students may, however, consult class notes, their textbook, or other math resources.  4.  Provide sufficient time for the  groups to work through the  assessment. ",42,mtms2011-10-136a,,
Scoring and Reporting Results 1.  Grade the answers the groups  recorded. (I prefer to give students both their independent score and the group grade.) 2.  Provide the new descriptive statistics for each class before engaging in a large group review of the concepts.  3.  Review the answers. ,43,mtms2011-10-136a,,
Students are usually very engaged and have been known to high-five one another or continue discussions if they are still confused about a problem. ,44,mtms2011-10-136a,,
Benefits foR stUdents,45,mtms2011-10-136a,,
The Three Heads activity provides obvious benefits for students beyond the opportunity to improve an assessment grade. Benefits include: ·  Greater engagement in mathematics discussions ·  Positive changes in mathematical  self-esteem and disposition ·  Deeper development of mathematical reasoning and communication skills ·  Opportunities for self-reflection ·  Exposure to different problem- solving strategies ·  Increased flexibility in approaching  and evaluating solutions ·  Greater understanding of the language of mathematics ·  More focused and discriminating reading of mathematics word problems,46,mtms2011-10-136a,,
"I found that my students became more reflective while working on class assignments and homework, so they were able to transfer skills learned from the Three Heads activity to other settings. ",47,mtms2011-10-136a,,
"Mathematics teachers should  be aware of the potential problems that may arise during the activity, so be prepared to be a mediator. For example, developing norms for group behavior or how to use the time provided may have to be negotiated within some groups. I found that some groups assumed that if everyone in the group had the same answer, then that answer had to be correct— only to discover later that everyone answered the problem incorrectly. This is a difficult but important lesson to learn. ",48,mtms2011-10-136a,,
Benefits foR teacheRs,49,mtms2011-10-136a,,
"The benefits for the mathematics teacher include revealing language  issues and misconceptions and uncovering gaps in one’s content or pedagogical knowledge. We tend to teach as we were taught, so gleaning insights about how your students interpret your teaching is beneficial to both parties. I especially preferred to listen in as the more academically capable students worked through those problems that were missed by a majority of the class members. Their explanations of those difficult concepts were often more effective than the ones I provided during instruction. This situation gave me an opportunity to reflect on aspects of lesson delivery such as pacing questions, developing vocabulary, using mathematical representations, and sequencing activities.",50,mtms2011-10-136a,,
gRading issUes,51,mtms2011-10-136a,,
"Students understand that tests and other assessments usually have more impact on their overall average than other categories of grades, so I have not fi elded many grade complaints in implementing the Three Heads activity. However, you may fi nd that students and your colleagues have different reactions to the opportunity to improve test grades, especially when groups are involved. ",52,mtms2011-10-136a,,
"I do not use Three Heads with  every test and, after introducing it the fi rst time, tell students frankly that it is a special activity. For the fi rst use of the strategy, I generally average the individual and group test score, unless the second grade is lower than the initial grade earned by the student. Sometimes, especially if a majority of the students fail a test, I replace the original grade with the second  test score. At other times, I add a set number of points to each student’s grade, no matter what was scored on the second attempt. If you determine ahead of time and let students know how the Three Heads strategy will affect their grade and actively monitor them while working in groups, grading concerns will be minimized.",53,mtms2011-10-136a,,
final thoUghts,54,mtms2011-10-136a,,
"One common complaint from the general public is that teachers spend too much time teaching to the test or using instructional time to teach testtaking strategies. The Three Heads assessment approach lets me know what my students understood and where they were confused. Therefore, I can be better prepared to address their misconceptions. Furthermore, I hear from all students, not just the dominant personalities in the  classroom. It is hoped that you will fi nd the strategy benefi cial for your students, too.",55,mtms2011-10-136a,,
