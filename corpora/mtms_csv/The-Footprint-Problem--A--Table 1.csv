By elevating modeling to the place of mathematical practice, CCSSM invites teachers to consider what modeling entails. Second, the descriptions of each of the mathematical practices are decidedly brief, leaving open the possibility for  paradigm (Lesh and Yoon 2007) away from telling students how important mathematics is in the world (“realizing mathematics”) toward students’ investigating a puzzling context for themselves (“mathematizing a reality”)?

11,The Footprint Problem: A Pathway to Modeling,"In typical problem-solving sequences, teachers tend to prepare students to solve problems in context, such as with word problems, by first teaching them skills, then facts, then big ideas (see table 1). Only after some degree of mastery of these isolated elements do students encounter problems in context, usually for the purposes of practice or application. Modeling differs noticeably in a number of  ways. First, modeling begins with the context and asks students to bring the mathematics they know to the problem. “Preteaching,” or guiding students toward specific mathematical content (e.g., skills, strategies, or models), runs counter to one purpose of modeling: allowing students to construct new mathematical understanding.

29,The Footprint Problem: A Pathway to Modeling,"Pollak (2011) describes modeling  as the act of creating an “idealized version of a real-life situation” that has been “translated into mathematical terms” (p. vi). For example, in the Footprint problem (Koellner-Clark and Lesh 2003), students were not asked to find the height of a particular person whose footprints were left behind, but to develop a “how to” tool kit that could be generalized for any footprint (see fig. 1). In this way, modeling is an iterative activity that begins with a situation (sometimes not particularly mathematical at all) and leads to the formulation of a mathematical question or problem. The “solution” to this question or problem enables us to better understand not only the original situation but also other situations related to it (see fig. 2).

Lorber, several years ago when she was a graduate student (and first-year teacher) in a course I taught at Pace University. We have collaborated on several projects centered on our shared love of middle school students and the math they study. Lorber teaches at a diverse urban middle school where 65 percent of the students are African American, 11 percent Hispanic,  17 percent white, 4 percent Asian,  and 3 percent other. Twenty percent of the students receive special education services, and 64 percent of students are eligible for a free or reduced-price lunch. ",31,The Footprint Problem: A Pathway to Modeling

Our goal here was not to present a perfectly literal, realworld context, but rather one that felt imaginable, was believable, and was intriguing to Lorber’s students.

88,The Footprint Problem: A Pathway to Modeling,"Jade: “Is this a real problem?” important move because the role of students’ questions is critical in modeling contexts for several reasons. First, we wanted to encourage students to be curious and wonder aloud about this situation. Dedicating five full minutes to writing questions was an invitation to think about this context. Second, their questions served as a formative assessment of how they understood the situation. Some were troubled by the motives of the alleged vandal, others questioned the high school’s own investigation surrounding the vandalism, and several others were intrigued by the shoe print itself (see table 2). As Nicol and Crespo (2005) have noted, when students are encouraged to visualize an imaginable situation and to become intrigued by it, a wider variety of genuine questions tend to emerge. Students’ questions about context tend to differ markedly from the kind of contrived, predictable questions often heard in math classes  in which a single, correct answer is ultimately revealed by the teacher.",88,The Footprint Problem: A Pathway to Modeling
89,The Footprint Problem: A Pathway to Modeling,"Finally, there remained an even more compelling reason for us to solicit students’ questions. The heart of mathematical modeling, according to Pollak, is “problem finding before problem solving” (2011, p. vii). Identifying what is interesting, intriguing, and worth exploring about a situation is, in fact, a critical aspect of doing mathematics and one all too often not left up to students. When we tell  students what (and how) to solve or to prove, we miss entirely that identifying the problem or theorem was in fact the essence of the mathematical activity. We publicly listed many of the questions that students wanted to pursue (each interesting, valuable, and worthwhile), but then asked the class to consider which ones could be explored mathematically.",89,The Footprint Problem: A Pathway to Modeling
90,The Footprint Problem: A Pathway to Modeling,"As a class, we decided to investigate the question “How tall is the vandal?” The question, as is, was not noticeably different from other school math problems. So we extended the question to ask, “Is it possible to determine the height of any person, based only on their shoe print? If so, how would you do it?” This subtle extension of the mathematics moved the task from mere problem solving (“How tall was the person wearing this shoe?”) toward modeling (“Does a model exist for predicting height from any shoe?”).",90,The Footprint Problem: A Pathway to Modeling
91,The Footprint Problem: A Pathway to Modeling,"It was vital that students ask and answer their own questions throughout the process, not simply about the initial context. Next, we asked students to generate a list of items that they would need to investigate this situation. We compiled a class list and then reminded students of the tool table that was permanently located in one corner of Lorber’s room. Mindful that “even simple models involve making choices” (CCSSI 2010,  p. 72), we wanted the choice of tool to be part of students’ decision-making process. Because tool choice and strategies are often linked, we witnessed several examples of students having to question, resolve, and negotiate these choices in their groups. Would they measure in inches or in centimeters? Could strips of large graph paper help them average the data? Would measuring the width of the shoe or maybe the perimeter be helpful? Could selfreported heights be trusted, or should students verify these claims?",91,The Footprint Problem: A Pathway to Modeling

94,The Footprint Problem: A Pathway to Modeling,"many choices can lead to unnecessary confusion for them and a difficultto-manage classroom for the teacher. To avoid these possibilities, teachers, textbooks, and even standardized tests often specify not only the tool to use but also the precise way to use a certain tool. We see this quite differently: When we keep students from making their own decisions, we deny them the chance to wrestle with important aspects of the mathematics, and we constrain the range of strategies that might emerge. It is not “unnecessary confusion” to ask students to choose  tools and strategies on their own. In fact, it is a critical aspect of constructing mathematics.",94,The Footprint Problem: A Pathway to Modeling
95,The Footprint Problem: A Pathway to Modeling,"Our creation of a tool table was a direct result of our consideration of another Standard for Mathematical Practice: Use appropriate tools strategically (CCSSI 2010, p. 7). Although many students chose and used the tools that made sense to them, we were sometimes surprised by their choices. For example, we supplied graph paper, imagining a scatter plot of the data, not a doublebar graph with height-shoe length bars. We envisioned that string might be used to measure a person’s height, not the perimeter of the footprint. It was important to encourage students to take risks and sometimes struggle with using tools sensibly (e.g., taping a meterstick to the end of a yardstick) or to abandon tools for ones they found more useful.",95,The Footprint Problem: A Pathway to Modeling

100,The Footprint Problem: A Pathway to Modeling,"Students revealed that they were in different places, developmentally, with respect to their understanding of ratio and proportion. We knew that some students would struggle and that not all students would be thinking multiplicatively. It was clear to us, however, that every student understood the context and the mathematical question we decided to pursue together. Students wrestled with the idea about what it means to form a relationship between two quantities and how to represent and express that relationship. One group imagined a person’s height as measured in shoes (see fig. 4a), another student argued that the ratio between her shoe and the suspect’s shoe gave insight into the ratio between their heights (see fig. 4b), and several tried to distill the mathematical relationship between shoe length and height using a ratio table (see fig. 4c).",100,The Footprint Problem: A Pathway to Modeling

102,The Footprint Problem: A Pathway to Modeling,"Meanwhile, others thought of the problem additively, noting the difference between the vandal’s shoe length and their own, and did not see the problem multiplicatively at all (see  fig. 5). We did not correct this misconception because Lorber’s yearlong plan included returning to proportional reasoning a little later. Additionally, Lorber’s classroom and school culture ensured that students would receive peer feedback (see fig. 6); whole-group feedback using a protocol; and, for those who continued working on the task, feedback from community members during a schoolwide event. Only when additive reasoning continued  to fail as an approach would students come to consider a different strategy and revise their thinking.",102,The Footprint Problem: A Pathway to Modeling

However, we witnessed the ways in which each student developed some new mathematics. Some saw a ratio table for the first time and began to try it out in other contexts. Others wrestled with ideas related to measurement and data collection. We even witnessed a contentious debate around precision: whether rounding data before or after they are averaged will make a significant difference. Experiences like these, we believe, are likely to build on the mathematics that students bring to a modeling task.

Most students experience mathematics as being led down a fairly narrow path, toward some slice of mathematics that has been predetermined by a textbook, teacher, or test. Lorber’s students got to theorize, express, and revise their own ways of thinking mathematically.
