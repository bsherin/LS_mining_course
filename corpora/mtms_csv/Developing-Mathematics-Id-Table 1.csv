0,Developing Mathematics Identity - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Donâ€™t let the noise of othersâ€™ opinions drown out your own inner voice.,,
1,Developing Mathematics Identity - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"â€”Steve Jobs, Stanford University",,
2,Developing Mathematics Identity - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"commencement speech, 2005",,
3,Developing Mathematics Identity - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Many middle school students approach math with caution, often trepidation, and generally less-than-complete confidence. Several factors contribute to their views of what math actually is (a system of rules to follow and formulas to apply) as well as who might be good at it (people who can see the path to an answer and calculate quickly). A few tell us they â€œjust arenâ€™t math peopleâ€â€”something we know to be false. Students at this age are immersed in forming their identity, including their mathematics identity. At a time when they might be embracing math as a powerful tool for reading their world, young people can instead succumb to fixed mindsets, the perpetuation of math myths, and a compromised relationship with math, thus affecting their school and career trajectory for the rest of their lives. Middle school math teachers have a unique opportunity to steer their studentsâ€™ mathematical development in a more positive direction.",,
4,Developing Mathematics Identity - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,WHAT THE RESEARCH SAYS,,
5,Developing Mathematics Identity - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We find the concept of â€œmathematics identityâ€ to be a critical component of framing the knowledge, skills, habits, attitudes, beliefs, and relationships that students need to develop as successful mathematics learners (Aguirre, Mayfield-Ingram, and Martin 2013; Anderson 2007; Boaler 2002; Grootenboer and Zevenbergen 2008). The term identity is one used by researchers across many fields. In the most general sense, it refers to how people see themselves and how others perceive them, taking into account personal histories, abilities, character, culture, and so on. Developmental psychologists often refer to the middle school years as a period of â€œidentity formationâ€ as young people discern who it is they want to become. Students in early adolescence simultaneously grapple with multiple identities on the basis of their identification and association with different groups. Factors such as gender, race, class, language, religion, neighborhood, family, and academic history play powerful roles in shaping how students see themselves in the world.",,
6,Developing Mathematics Identity - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In The Impact of Identity in Kâ€“8 Mathematics Learning and Teaching, Aguirre and colleagues provide this definition of â€œmathematics identityâ€:",,
7,Developing Mathematics Identity - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The dispositions and deeply held beliefs that students develop about their ability to participate and perform effectively in mathematical contexts and to use mathematics in powerful ways across the contexts of their lives. (Aguirre, Mayfield-Ingram, and Martin 2013, p. 14)",,
8,Developing Mathematics Identity - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"They go on to make a strong case for how studentsâ€™ mathematics identities connect to their other identities. Each identity has the potential to influence the other. For example, a particular female might simultaneously have all these identities: an athlete, a good daughter, a Catholic, a Spanish-speaking immigrant, a strong student, and someone who is slow in math. Instructional choices that teachers make have a significant impact on each studentâ€™s mathematics identity (Aguirre, Mayfield-Ingram, and Martin 2013). From the learning communities they create in their classrooms to their daily instructional choices, teachers have the power to shape studentsâ€™ mathematics identities and to debunk many of the math myths operating in our culture.",,
9,Developing Mathematics Identity - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"One research-based concept we regularly use in our mathematics classes to support mathematics identity is â€œmindsetâ€ (see Dweck 2006). Dweck has spent decades studying the benefits of having a â€œgrowthâ€ mindset rather than a â€œfixedâ€ mindset in a wide range of contexts, including schools. Mathematics is an academic area that is particularly prone to a â€œfixedâ€ mindset: Most people think they are either born with or without math ability, something they essentially cannot change. However, when Dweck works with adolescents, she explains to them that their brain is more like a muscle; using it makes it stronger. She tells them,",,
10,Developing Mathematics Identity - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"When you learn new things, these tiny connections in the brain actually multiply and get stronger. The more that you challenge your mind to learn, the more your brain cells grow. Then, things that you once found very hard, or even impossibleâ€”like speaking a foreign language or doing algebraâ€”seem to become easy. The result is a stronger, smarter brain. (Dweck 2006, p. 219)",,
11,Developing Mathematics Identity - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We strongly encourage taking time to teach students about their mathematics identity and the research that confirms that they can grow their math brains (Willis 2010). Here, we share some strategies for supporting the development of our studentsâ€™ positive and powerful mathematical identitiesâ€”quite possibly our most important work as math teachers.",,
12,Developing Mathematics Identity - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
13,Developing Mathematics Identity - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,WHAT TEACHERS CAN DO,,
14,Developing Mathematics Identity - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We have generated four pillars of practice (see fig. 1) for investing in mathematics identity, each of which is described below. The ideas are not necessarily new. However, taken together, they provide a strong start for any middle school math teacher who is interested in promoting the development of powerful and positive mathematics identity for all students.",,
15,Developing Mathematics Identity - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Before discussing the details of the four pillars, we articulate some key elements of our daily teaching that we take as givens. First, students work in groups, meaning that we invest in classroom community all year, make use of roles, and assign group-worthy tasks, with the goals of promoting equity and ensuring that a few students do not dominate interaction. Second, students keep math journals, which they use every day in class; math journals contain a variety of entries including but not limited to warmups, classwork, open-ended reflections, and homework. Third, as teachers, we see ourselves as facilitators of classroom activities and co-learners with our students. Finally, we communicate high expectations for every student to learn mathematics and to contribute to the math learning of others.",,
16,Developing Mathematics Identity - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,KNOW AND BELIEVE IN YOUR STUDENTS,,
17,Developing Mathematics Identity - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Teachers who want to build mathematics identity know their students as people, make an effort to understand studentsâ€™ life circumstances, and believe unconditionally in each personâ€™s mathematical capacity. This means vigilantly viewing student attributes as assets rather than deficits. We find it especially valuable to have students tell their individual mathematical stories at the outset of each course, reflecting on these documents as the year unfolds. Each â€œmathography,â€ essentially a math autobiography (see fig. 2), affords a vehicle for setting the mathematical record straight on the childâ€™s terms (often clarifying past grades or identifying challenges) and initiating direct communication between student and teacher.",,
18,Developing Mathematics Identity - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Students are given these instructions for creating a mathography:,,
19,Developing Mathematics Identity - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
20,Developing Mathematics Identity - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Create a piece of work on an 8 1/2 Ã— 11 inch piece of paper that represents you as a mathematician. Include your strengths, your challenges, and how you plan to actively contribute to our math community this year. Be creative!",,
21,Developing Mathematics Identity - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Ideally, individuals share their narratives with one another and revisit them over time. We have students write reflections on their mathography, one midyear and one at yearâ€™s end. The semester reflection serves as a revision of the initial mathography, encouraging students to evaluate their progress and articulate goals for the months ahead. If feasible, the year-end reflection takes the form of a letter to the childâ€™s next math teacher.",,
22,Developing Mathematics Identity - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,REDEFINE MATHEMATICAL SUCCESS,,
23,Developing Mathematics Identity - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"For students to believe in one another as capable thinkers and problem solvers, they must directly experience the positive contributions each of their peers can make. This requires moving beyond a definition of mathematical success centered on mastering algorithms or quickly generating right answers. As teachers, it means that we must name and make public the skills and talents that each child brings to the work, such as the following:",,
24,Developing Mathematics Identity - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,â€¢ Representing an idea in a new way,,
25,Developing Mathematics Identity - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,â€¢ Asking an insightful question,,
26,Developing Mathematics Identity - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,â€¢ Listening carefully and restating someoneâ€™s thinking,,
27,Developing Mathematics Identity - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,â€¢ Making a systematic list,,
28,Developing Mathematics Identity - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,â€¢ Talking about an idea before writing it down,,
29,Developing Mathematics Identity - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,â€¢ Using or interpreting a graph,,
30,Developing Mathematics Identity - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,â€¢ Breaking a complex task down into smaller ones,,
31,Developing Mathematics Identity - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,â€¢ Working with the calculator,,
32,Developing Mathematics Identity - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,â€¢ Relating a new problem to a previous problem,,
33,Developing Mathematics Identity - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,â€¢ Connecting multiple ideas,,
34,Developing Mathematics Identity - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,â€¢ Using symbols to communicate an idea,,
35,Developing Mathematics Identity - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,â€¢ Drawing a diagram or picture,,
36,Developing Mathematics Identity - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Keeping a class list of such appreciated math expertise encourages all to be mindful of what it really takes to do math successfully. The teacher might facilitate a class conversation at the beginning of the year that launches such a list. Then students could add to it during their work. What proves most powerful is when a teacher notices the work of a â€œlow statusâ€ student and publically acknowledges that personâ€™s contribution. For example, an English language learner who seldom speaks in class might create a visual example or ask a clarifying question that helps the group communicate its idea. The teacher can draw attention to this, boosting the studentâ€™s math status and simultaneously contributing to positive mathematics identity.",,
37,Developing Mathematics Identity - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
38,Developing Mathematics Identity - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"If we commit to honoring the differences in our math classroom, then we will remember that some people need to think, some need to write, and some need to talk as they make sense of a new idea or concept. We will implement classroom routines, like the Tablecloth Protocol (see  fig. 3), that create space for students who need more time to collect and express their mathematical thoughts.",,
39,Developing Mathematics Identity - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"When selecting tasks for the Tablecloth Protocol, we look for problems with multiple access points that benefit from nonalgorithmic approaches and diverse problem-solving strategies. Such tasks promote communication among students and lend themselves to more opportunities for feedback and revision. One of our favorites is the Border problem (Boaler and Humphreys 2005) (see fig. 4). In the Border problem, students use a visual representation to move from concrete calculations to more abstract generalizations using algebra. The central role of the visual display in this problem and the focus on pattern to seed the generalizations invites all learners to share their ideas.",,
40,Developing Mathematics Identity - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
41,Developing Mathematics Identity - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In addition to offering a space for more than one mathematical method, structures like the Tablecloth Protocol also provide a way to positively work with mistakes as points of mathematical interest and conversation. Unless taught otherwise, most students continue to see mistakes as sources of embarrassment and shame. They should be just the opposite because mistakes make our synapses fire and our brains grow, which is not the case with correct answers derived from mindlessly following a procedure. Only in classrooms where errors serve as a cause for inquiry, even celebration, can we cultivate the kind of social safety and alternative definitions of mathematical success that allow every student to truly contribute in meaningful ways that will be honored and respected by every other student in the room.",,
42,Developing Mathematics Identity - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,PRIORITIZE STUDENT VOICE,,
43,Developing Mathematics Identity - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Who is doing the work? This is a question we ask ourselves after teaching or observing any math lesson, especially at the middle school level. We hope the answer is â€œthe students,â€ but too often it is â€œthe teacher.â€ Why is this question so important to us? In our experience, the extent to which studentsâ€™ mathematical voices (both spoken and written) play a role in the math classroom directly influences the mathematics identities they develop. If students spend most of a lesson watching someone else do the math and then duplicate what that person does, then they are unlikely to see how a new idea connects to their prior learning or to generate their own conjectures relevant to the topic at hand. Sometimes, in an effort to make math class a safe place, we reduce the intellectual challenge, depriving students of thinking for themselves, leading to boredom and frustration on everyoneâ€™s part (Willis 2010).",,
44,Developing Mathematics Identity - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Nearly 70 years ago, mathematician and mathematics educator PÃ³lya offered advice to math colleagues that holds to this day:",,
45,Developing Mathematics Identity - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The teacher should help, but not too much and not too little, so that the students shall have a reasonable share of the work. (PÃ³lya 1945, p. 1)",,
46,Developing Mathematics Identity - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Similarly, Dan Meyer advises us to generally â€œbe less helpfulâ€ (Meyer 2009). The inherent message is that students need to take responsibility for their own learning and the learning of each other. We offer a list of some strategies we use to make this pedagogical shift.",,
47,Developing Mathematics Identity - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,1. Limit broadcast questioning.,,
48,Developing Mathematics Identity - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Asking questions of the whole class and then calling on one student among the first raised hands is a habit all math teachers need to break because it inevitably privileges the voices of a small group of students. Instead, give students a chance to write or talk to a partner before anyone speaks publically.",,
49,Developing Mathematics Identity - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,2. Establish routines that help students develop ideas privately and express them in a small group before presenting publicly.,,
50,Developing Mathematics Identity - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Such subtle shifts as having students â€œthink-pair-shareâ€ in the midst of a class discussion or using roles in groups rather simply asking students to work together can have a huge impact because they ensure that every child has a way to take part in the collective work.,,
51,Developing Mathematics Identity - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,3. Leverage formative assessment and self-assessment.,,
52,Developing Mathematics Identity - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Have students do a mid-lesson â€œfist to five.â€ Every student or one from each group holds up a hand, showing a fist or a number of fingers to indicate the extent to which the student or the group is ready to move on. When using this scale, a fist means â€œI/we need helpâ€ and five fingers means â€œI/we can help another student or group.â€",,
53,Developing Mathematics Identity - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,4. Have students help set goals and write learning targets.,,
54,Developing Mathematics Identity - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"When only the teacher sets goals for the class, math can feel like something being â€œdone to studentsâ€ rather than something they do. Asking students to participate in goal setting can shift the power dynamic and send strong messages about the confidence we have in our students.",,
55,Developing Mathematics Identity - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Ultimately, our job as teachers is to draw the math out of students. To do so, we must remember that it is in them. We must create safe spaces in our classrooms for students to express ideas about which they remain uncertain, help them experience the power of making conjectures and verifying or refuting them, and validate the process as much as the end product. This will require withholding judgment, maintaining flexibility in terms of how students express their thinking, being patient, and providing as many tools as possible.",,
56,Developing Mathematics Identity - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,MONITOR IDENTITY FORMATION,,
57,Developing Mathematics Identity - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"If developing each studentâ€™s â€œmathematics identityâ€ is important to us, then we must monitor it regularly. Targeted formative assessments embedded in our daily instruction, such as think warmups, index cards, and exit tickets, allow us to gather valuable data about student progress related to mathematics conceptual understanding as well as identity. Teaching students to authentically self-assess plays a critical role. If students can articulate what they know and what they are working on, then we as teachers stand a much better chance of being able to help them. If they can learn to use the language of â€œmindsetâ€ and â€œmathematics identityâ€ and recognize that such things are always changing and always ripe for revision, then math will become a different subject for them. For us, journals have served as a primary tool for this piece of the work. They provide a running record of each studentâ€™s growth, private documentation of their mathematics identity formation, and evidence of conceptual exploration.",,
58,Developing Mathematics Identity - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,A WORK IN PROGRESS,,
59,Developing Mathematics Identity - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Identity formation, including mathematics identity, is a lifelong process. This holds true for math teachers as well. As we focus more time and energy on supporting students in the development of their mathematics identity, we benefit from examining our own. In doing so, we should challenge ourselves with questions like the following:",,
60,Developing Mathematics Identity - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,â€¢ What is my own mathematics identity?,,
61,Developing Mathematics Identity - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,â€¢ How do I see my own mathematics identity reflected in that of my students?,,
62,Developing Mathematics Identity - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"â€¢ Do I see any patterns in the mathematics identities of my students based on their other identifications, especially gender, class, and ethnicity?",,
63,Developing Mathematics Identity - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,â€¢ What am I still grappling with? Do I fully understand the mathematics myself?,,
64,Developing Mathematics Identity - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,â€¢ How can I invest in my own mathematical identity?,,
65,Developing Mathematics Identity - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,â€¢ How can I share this with my students?,,
66,Developing Mathematics Identity - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Many math teachers are initially attracted to math because of its order and perceived objectivity. Right answers feel good. However, teaching math is not about the answers; it is about the journey we take each year with our students. As the guides who chart the course of exploration, we must believe in ourselves as well as in our students. This means viewing our own mistakes as opportunities to learn and grow. We cannot say too strongly how important it is for us to reflect continuously on how our own assumptions, and potentially skewed perceptions of students, result in self-fulfilling prophesies. Our students become the words we use: brilliant, lazy, high, low, fast, slow. Let us not forget that a budding mathematician resides in every one of them.",,
