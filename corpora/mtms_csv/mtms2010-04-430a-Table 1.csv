Math teacher/basketball coach calls technical fouls!,1,mtms2010-04-430a,,
"I have an issue with one problem in the “Palette of Problems” in the December 2009/January 2010 issue. Problem 2 says that David’s basketball coach assigns uniform numbers 1, 3, 7, 13, 21, . . . . ",2,mtms2010-04-430a,,
Is this a trick question? Is David’s coach looking for technical fouls each game? ,3,mtms2010-04-430a,,
"High school or middle school  coaches know that only certain numbers are allowed in basketball. Jersey number 7 would draw a technical foul every game. It has to do with officials signaling (with their hands) the number of a player who committed a foul to the official scorer. Numbers like 6, 7, 8, 9, 16, 17, 18, 19, and so on, are illegal.",4,mtms2010-04-430a,,

"During a meeting with several seventh-grade teachers, we decided to brainstorm different ways to introduce the distributive property. In our experience, students usually grasp the concept of the expanding component rather quickly, but they struggle with the factoring component. ",14,mtms2010-04-430a,,
"When introducing the idea of  factoring, I began by asking students to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of two numbers. Many students answer the question by using a method in which the common prime factors are factored out until the remaining two factors are relatively prime (see the example below). This method can also be used to simplify fractions. The fraction 4/5 is the simplified version of 120/150.",15,mtms2010-04-430a,,

"The GCF is 2 • 3 • 5, or 30. The remaining factor of 120 is 4.",17,mtms2010-04-430a,,
The remaining factor of 150 is 5.,18,mtms2010-04-430a,,
"I transferred this method to factoring algebraic expressions, but I only used it to help factor the coefficients, not the variables. ",19,mtms2010-04-430a,,
"After I showed this method to my  colleagues, we decided that it could easily translate for use with the variables (see the example at top, right). It provides a nice visual reminder of how to separate out the common factors.  120d 3   60d 3   20d 3     4d 3     4d 2     4d 150d 2   75d 2   25d 2     5d 2     5d 2 • 3 • 5 • d • d • (4d + 5) = 30d 2(4d + 5)",20,mtms2010-04-430a,,
