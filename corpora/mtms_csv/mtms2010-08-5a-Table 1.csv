"They “Get” Fractions as Pies; Now What? pPicture a fifth-grade classroom where  students are learning about fractions. Fraction circles are being used to introduce the topic and build on the basic concepts. Near the end of the fraction unit, the teacher asks his students to compare the relative sizes of 3/7 and 7/8. All but three of his students reach for their fraction circles instead of reasoning about the relationships between the two fractions.",2,mtms2010-08-5a,,
"The teacher had expected many students to compare the given fractions to the benchmark measurement of 1/2, recognizing that 3/7 is less than 1/2 and 7/8 is greater than 1/2. ",3,mtms2010-08-5a,,
The teacher had the same uneasy feeling as occurs when students reach for a calculator to complete a simple calculation. He was concerned that his students’ use of fraction circles was not helping them internalize fraction concepts in the way that he had intended. This concern resonates with research on learning and teaching fractions. ,4,mtms2010-08-5a,,

Mike’s solution in figure 2 illustrates this point.

Notice that Karen’s accurate use of a number line (see fig. 1) in her postassessment response showed growth from her preassessment. However, Mike’s use of unit fractions to compare 3/7 to 3/5 demonstrates a more developed level of understanding. At this level of understanding, students can demonstrate their ability to choose among effective strategies as they compare fractions, such as with the use of benchmarks, unit fractions, equivalence, common denominators, and algorithms. This idea of helping students move along a trajectory that values development of conceptual understanding with a goal of attaining procedural fluency is supported by a National Research Council (2001) panel. ",27,mtms2010-08-5a,,
"The use of models to develop  understanding of fraction concepts is an iterative process. For example, a sixth-grade student, similar to Mike, should no longer need to use a model to compare two given fractions. He should be able to analyze the fractions, the context of the problem, and then flexibly select from a range of strategies to make the comparison. However, as middle school students begin to solve problems involving new concepts, such as multiplication and division of fractions, models can again be used to help bring meaning to these concepts. This idea is demonstrated by Kelyn’s work (see fig. 4a). ",28,mtms2010-08-5a,,

"Using models to highlight the  meaning of division should precede the learning of an algorithm for division involving fractions. Researchers agree that students may struggle with the use and understanding of formal algorithms when their knowledge is dependent primarily on memory, rather than anchored within a deep understanding of the foundational concepts (Kieren, as cited in Huinker 2002). For example, Cameron (see fig. 4b) seemed to have jumped to a procedure without paying attention to the meaning of the operation or the numbers involved. ",33,mtms2010-08-5a,,

For example, a teacher might want to build on Kelyn’s and Abdi’s understandings about division of a whole number by a unit fraction. To do so, the teacher may lead off a discussion using their solutions as a way to engage all students in developing further their understanding of the meaning and impact of dividing by a fraction. In particular, he or she could show these two solutions and pose questions that help all students analyze aspects of the models that reinforce a deeper, more complete meaning of division. A set of well-engineered questions could be posed to extend their reasoning beyond unit fractions, such as the following:  •	 Your	model	shows	that	there	are	4	 one-fourths in every whole. How many one-fourths do you think are  in 5 (or 6, or 10, or 100)? •	 How	many	thirds,	fifths,	or	sixths	 are in 4 (or 5, or 6, or 100)? •	 What	patterns	do	you	see? •	 Make	and	test	a	conjecture	about	 the patterns that you see.
