"The world has entered an age of instant access to larger and larger amounts of information, and the need for methods to deal with this data is growing.  In response to that need, data analysis and probability have become more prominent in the mathematics curriculum. NCTM offers several books on data analysis and probability that provide tools, activities, and lesson plans for educators to help students learn and understand basic concepts and apply them to everyday life.",2,mtms2009-12-252a,,

"This department shares creative solutions to the problems in “Solve It!” articles, which appear a few times a year in MTMS. Classroom teachers can send their students’ work, along with sufficient information to follow their students’ thinking. Send manuscripts to edward s.

Rule of ten,25,mtms2009-12-252a,,
"Malik and Melinda each have an unmarked 4-inch wooden ruler. They realized that if they placed only two well-chosen marks on the rod, they could measure any inch unit length from 1 inch to 4 inches. Malik marked the 1-inch length  and the 3-inch length. Melinda marked the 1-inch length  and the 2-inch length.",26,mtms2009-12-252a,,

Suppose you had a 10-inch unmarked wooden ruler: •  What are the fewest marks needed on the ruler to   measure each inch unit length from 1 inch to 10 inches? • Where would you place the marks on the ruler? lustrates their understanding of how inches measure up. ,29,mtms2009-12-252a,,
"José Francisco Sala García’s stu- tThe student work in this article il- dents realized that the fewest number of marks needed on the ruler was 4. They found different sets of marks that would allow the unit lengths from 1 inch to 10 inches to be measured. Claudia, for example, made marks at the 1-inch, 4-inch, 7-inch, and 9-inch  lengths (see fig. 1a). Vicent marked the 1-inch, 5-inch, 6-inch, and 8-inch lengths (see fig. 1b). Although most solutions have the 1-inch length marked, Ainhoa and Margarita found solution sets that do not require this length to be marked (see fig. 2). In all, Sala García’s students presented ten different solutions (see also fig. 3). If readers are interested in exploring the idea of a minimally marked  ruler, do an Internet search for sparse ruler or Golomb ruler. With a Golomb ruler, an additional condition is that no pairs of marks on the ruler are the same distance apart.",30,mtms2009-12-252a,,
