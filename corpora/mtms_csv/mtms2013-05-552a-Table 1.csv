"allow students to personalize mathematics. In the context of this artic le, we define narratives as short stories, written by students, that contain a mathematical word problem centered on the students’ lives and interests. These narratives can be supported with art, such as drawings or photographs. W hen students conceptualize mathematics through these narratives, they are able to connect the relevance of mathematics to their ever yday lives. It is important to recognize that separating language arts and mathematics into their own individual curriculum slots may not be beneficial for students. Absent a word context and a meaningful setting, mathematical thinking can be unnatural (Moyer 2000). Through stor y creation,  ",4,mtms2013-05-552a,,

"Using Narra tives & Art terri L. kurz and Barbara Bar tholomew mathematical scenarios and numeracy applications are contextualized. Contextualizing mathematics is an important element in student engage- ment. Nicol and Crespo (2005) found that when mathematical tasks contained content familiar to students’ lives, the students were much more curious, engaged, and attuned to the tasks’ mathematical relevance. As students create stor y scenes to illuminate newly acquired knowledge, integrated learning occurs (Bereiter and Scardamalia 1987). Furthermore, integrating language arts and math is a pedagogically useful way to help students learn mathematical material ( Wilcox and Monroe 2011).",7,mtms2013-05-552a,,
This article describes a framework using student-authored narratives to help students build stronger connections to the application of mathematics. ,8,mtms2013-05-552a,,
"The framework allows middle school students to use their creativity while applying and reinforcing mathematical material. The lesson is appropriate for all levels of middle school learners, including students with special needs and English language learners. Students will create narratives at their own ability levels, making the lesson appropriate for learners with a variety of needs (Hitchcock et al. 2002). connecting to standards",9,mtms2013-05-552a,,
"Providing middle school students with the opportunity to write their own narratives directly relates to P rinciples and Standards for School Mathematics (NCTM 2000), as well as the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSM) (CCSSI 2010).

The Connections Standard addresses the need for students to recognize and apply mathematics in contexts outside mathematics. Allowing students to write narratives provides the opportunity to address these various Standards.  guiding the students toward a context",12,mtms2013-05-552a,,
The lesson should begin with a whole-class discussion regarding mathematics in familiar settings. The following prompts can be used: •	 Describe	an	incident	in	your	life	 when mathematics was used.,13,mtms2013-05-552a,,
•	 When	have	you	used	mathematics	,14,mtms2013-05-552a,,
"CCSSM specifies that students will  outside the classroom? make sense of a problem by explaining it to themselves and to others, find entry points during the solution process, employ adaptive reasoning while comprehending meaningful applications, and demonstrate the ability to contextualize. One CCSSM goal is that all students will “read the arguments of others, decide whether they make sense, and ask useful questions to clarify or improve the arguments” (CCSSI 2010, p. 7). Further, CCSSM encourages the flow of curriculum between and across subjects so that students may more fully comprehend the connectivity of knowledge.",15,mtms2013-05-552a,,

"The prompts keep the topic broad  and open for the students’ imagination. Teachers may opt to use commercial literature to guide students’ narratives. We have noted, however, that when commercial literature is  used, students’ ideas and creativity are often restricted to closely match the sample. Students frequently choose a similar theme and structure for their narratives.	Depending	on	the	teacher’s	 goals, commercial literature may be a viable option. Using the students’ responses to the questions as a forum for problem solving and extending the lessons, however, can result in more robust mathematical investigations and more personalized themes.",18,mtms2013-05-552a,,
"Middle school students will likely have a well-developed sense of story schemata, otherwise known as story grammar. Most students are aware that stories rotate around a problem or other goal-directed problemsolving episode. Students who may not have this knowledge will need to learn about simple story elements before beginning this activity  (Mandler and Johnson 1977; Stein and Trabasso 1981; Schank 1995).",19,mtms2013-05-552a,,
creating a FraMework For the narratives,20,mtms2013-05-552a,,
"When creating the narratives, students can be asked to follow several general requirements and include various elements, which can include the following:  1.  A title page 2.  Four to eight pages of text   (depending on students’ ability), with writing on each page 3.  A consistent theme 4.  Art on each page (either drawings  or photographs) 5.  A final page that contains a solvable mathematical dilemma without an answer written in the text ",21,mtms2013-05-552a,,
"A storyboard template can guide students. The template has an area for text and an area to describe (or draw in rough-draft form) the accompanying illustration. If more text is needed, the teacher can provide a sheet of lined paper for the drafts instead. The art portion of the lesson (whether  drawings or photographs) should not be minimized in importance because students enjoy including art. Their fondness for art becomes especially evident when they are sharing the narratives. ",22,mtms2013-05-552a,,
"Excerpts from narratives by a fifth grader and seventh grader, respectively, are shown in figures 1 and 2. Student themes are personal and demonstrate a practical application of mathematics. A pair of seventh graders developed the technology-supported narrative using PowerPoint®, the text of which is displayed in figure 3. The theme is student-centered; creating stilts by flipping over crutches is not often seen in a mathematical context. The text of another technology-created narrative, relating to the student’s cat, is shown in figure 4.  addressing",23,mtms2013-05-552a,,
Potential concerns,24,mtms2013-05-552a,,
"To reduce grammatical and structural errors, ask the students to submit draft storyboards and text. The teacher should be proactive in evaluating the rough drafts. He or she may wish to make the task a peer-editing exercise as well. Critiquing the evolving texts is a time-consuming aspect of this  lesson, but it is critical because students will make mistakes. These mistakes should be tackled early.",25,mtms2013-05-552a,,
"Several important points must be  addressed when evaluating rough drafts.  •	 Is there a theme? Did the student  develop a narrative that makes sense in relation to the theme, or are word problems simply listed? It is important to emphasize theme and plot as the students construct their rough drafts. Students sometimes misunderstand the instructions and just list word problems on each page.",26,mtms2013-05-552a,,
"•	 Is the mathematics logical? Are  the numbers reasonable within the context? For example, a new shirt would not cost $0.25 or a standard ",27,mtms2013-05-552a,,

"car would not go 100 miles per hour on the freeway, but in certain comical or fantasy situations, these attributes may be appropriate.  •	 Is the mathematical dilemma solvable  using the data in the text? Text elements must exist to help the reader answer the dilemma embedded in the narrative. Sometimes students  omit critical information.  •	 Can the author explain and answer the dilemma? It is essential that students be able to solve and explain their own question because they are the experts. Students need to present the solution to the teacher before the final draft is created to be sure they can solve the dilemma.",29,mtms2013-05-552a,,
"Fig. 3 taking Steps on Stilts, involving technology, was a narrative produced by a pair of seventh graders.",30,mtms2013-05-552a,,

Stilt Step Test. a stilt step is about 27 inches long.,35,mtms2013-05-552a,,
The Math Question. How many steps would it take to go 100 yards? How many steps would it take to go 100 yards using stilt steps? (a) the text of the narrative (b) the regular Step test frame,36,mtms2013-05-552a,,
"A final consideration regards gifted  students. Sometimes it may be necessary to encourage deeper, more challenging mathematics. For example, in figure 4 the student challenges the reader to use a pie chart to display the ways in which the cat spent the day. The student originally had listed a simple number of hours (20) that the cat slept. This student was encouraged to make the narrative more mathematically challenging. Elapsed time, fractions, and decimals were integrated into the text with teacher encouragement.",37,mtms2013-05-552a,,
"The technology-supported narratives may take longer to construct  because students may need to share equipment, especially digital cameras. If students develop a clear plan for photograph usage while constructing their rough drafts, they can use time more effectively when taking the necessary photographs. Students can also be given the option of photographing, or otherwise accessing media, at school or at home depending on the technology that is available outside class. Supplies or props should be prepared in advance. Using a cell phone camera to take, use, and download photographs may be an acceptable way to alleviate technology supply problems.",38,mtms2013-05-552a,,
"Another issue with the technology  involves the accuracy of the photographs. For example, the draft version of the narrative in figure 3a had inaccuracies. The student put his foot too far behind the chalk line in the picture first provided. The corrected photograph is shown in figure 3b. The student measured his step at 12 inches, but the image showed a much smaller step because his foot was improperly placed. Although it is very difficult to catch all these errors, it is important to look for them when providing feedback on early drafts. In this instance, the student took multiple photographs and found a more accurate image. Encouraging students to take multiple photographs (perhaps three per subject) can help alleviate potential problems.  coordinating with  other teachers",39,mtms2013-05-552a,,
"At the middle-grades level, students often take subject-specific courses. If this is the case, the narrative project could be a team effort: The language arts teacher could guide the language portion while the math teacher guides the mathematics section. This crosscurricular endeavor could help teachers unify their curriculum. If the students share an art teacher, he or she could then guide art content. In contrast, the math teacher might be the only instructor directing this lesson if coordination is not possible. The benefits of integrating language and mathematics can still be achieved, albeit with a little more effort by the math teacher.  sharing the Math  in the narratives",40,mtms2013-05-552a,,
"After the narratives are written, the teacher should provide an opportunity to investigate them with the entire class. Teachers can make copies of the projects and share them with the class or project them on a large screen for a class discussion. If students used ",41,mtms2013-05-552a,,
"PowerPoint, projecting the narratives to the class would be simple.",42,mtms2013-05-552a,,
"The student author, in the role of presenter, automatically becomes the expert and assumes the role of teacher by answering questions and guiding fellow students (along with the actual classroom teacher) in solving the dilemma. Through rehearsing and retelling, the math lesson becomes processed into comprehensible components. In so doing, learning and mastery of subject matter are reinforced (Gambrell,  Pfeiffer, and Wilson 1985). Students often enjoy this aspect of the lesson.",43,mtms2013-05-552a,,
"Students may not be able to emphasize the most fruitful mathematics in their narratives. Enrichment opportunities to explore deeper mathematical investigations may be needed. In one narrative, the author used the term average; the more appropriate mathematical term is arithmetic mean. The teacher can help the students discover the application of mathematical terms, such as arithmetic mean and average, within the student’s narrative context while examining the ideas of mode and median. The teacher can address how average is sometimes used interchangeably with arithmetic mean in everyday contexts but, in reality, there are several types of averages.",44,mtms2013-05-552a,,
"The classroom teacher’s role is to enrich the mathematical goals using the students’ themes. Referencing the narrative in figure 3, several prompts can be given to guide students to a deeper mathematical analysis:  •	 Write	an	equation	showing	how	 many steps will yield a certain number of inches when taking regular steps. How would you define the variables? How would the table of values appear? Explain.",45,mtms2013-05-552a,,

In allowing students to provide a context for mathematics, they are able to glean relevance from knowledge  by applying it to novel contexts   (Franz and Pope 2005). The work becomes interesting and exciting for students as they find themselves being not only mathematicians and storytellers but also peer teachers. Most important, however, is that in the process of students watching, doing, creating, retelling, and explaining what they know, visible evidence is produced so that the teacher can assess student understanding.
