"After getting over the hurdle of implementing  cooperative learning, one teacher’s action research  revealed that her students were more engaged  and more willing to tackle difficult problems.",1,mtms2010-09-96a,,
"student iI always felt that my classroom was  missing something. Although I was incorporating the NCTM Standards in my math classroom, I longed to use other teaching strategies to deepen students’ understanding of the “how” as well as the “why.” I remembered that as a student, with the teacher in front of the class dispersing mathematical information, I did not learn as much as I could have. Yet here I was, doing the same thing with my students, without knowing how to change. ",2,mtms2010-09-96a,,
"I wanted and needed to implement cooperative learning into my classroom. The biggest reason for not doing so was my lack of knowledge and understanding of how. My past educational experiences and teacher preparation had not directly exposed me to this teaching approach. The majority of my education, beginning in elementary school and continuing through the postsecondary years, operated on the direct-instruction model. Therefore, when I became a teacher, I automatically repeated what I knew from those sixteen plus years as a student.",3,mtms2010-09-96a,,
"The first time I was able to see  the incredible benefit of cooperative learning was in my graduate classes at the University of Nebraska−Lincoln in the Math in the Middle Institute Partnership, a twenty-five-month National Science Foundation professional development project. I was immersed in an atmosphere that expected participants to form partnerships with one another as we deepened our individual understandings of math and pedagogy through courses expecting collaboration and active learning. ",4,mtms2010-09-96a,,
"The math problems incorporated throughout the entire program were challenging. I gained important knowledge by listening to the different ways that my peers approached and solved problems. When I explained problems to others, my own understanding of the mathematics increased. I knew I wanted to give my students a similarly rich learning experience.",5,mtms2010-09-96a,,
the stRUggle to change,6,mtms2010-09-96a,,
"Change is difficult. Changing an educator’s teaching style is perhaps one of the most difficult challenges in educational reform (Fennema and Nelson 1997; Fullan 2001). I struggled to use cooperative learning. I was afraid to lose control of my classroom, both in terms of management and instruction, and never allowed myself to fully transition to a cooperative environment. Although I would permit students to work together from time to time, it usually ended with few students completing the task, several students copying others’ work, and others using the time to socialize. In the end, it was easier to remain teacher-centered and continue along the same path. ",7,mtms2010-09-96a,,
The significant point at which my  classroom became a more studentcentered atmosphere occurred when I moved to a different school district and started using College Preparatory Mathematics (Sallee et al. 2002) and Connected Mathematics (Lappan  et al. 2004). Both curricula incorporate cooperative learning techniques. I was submerged in curriculum that was focused on cooperative learning and surrounded by colleagues who were also implementing this teaching strategy. Previous excuses for teacherled instruction became invalid. ,8,mtms2010-09-96a,,

Johnson and Johnson (1999) define cooperative learning as this: ,10,mtms2010-09-96a,,
"Although I would permit students to work together from  time to time, it  usually ended with  few students  completing the task,  several students  copying others’ work, and others using the  time to socialize. ",11,mtms2010-09-96a,,
"Students work together to accomplish shared goals. Students seek outcomes that are beneficial to all. Students discuss material with each other, help one another understand it, and encourage each other to work hard. (p. 68)",12,mtms2010-09-96a,,
Kagan (1994) defines cooperative learning through four principles:  1.  Positive interdependence 2.  Individual accountability 3.  Equal participation 4.  Simultaneous interaction,13,mtms2010-09-96a,,
"Kagan also suggests that the sole difference between group work and cooperative learning can be summed up by these four essential components. Researchers list numerous positive outcomes of using cooperative learning. Several highly researched and anticipated benefits include higher academic achievement and social  skills development (e.g., Johnson and Johnson 1999; Kagan 1994; Leiken and Zaslavsky 1997; Ma 1996; Siegel 2005; Slavin 1999; Toumasis 2004). Tied to increased academic achievement is the development and growth of higher-level thinking skills, more frequent transfer of learned concepts to new situations, and more time on task ( Johnson and Johnson 1999). This academic progress is especially noticeable among minority and low-achieving students (Kagan 1994; Leiken and Zaslavsky 1997; Ma 1996). Cooperative learning has a positive impact on classroom climate; content communication; and students’ self-esteem, attendance, attitudes toward education, and psychological health (Leiken and Zaslavsky 1997; Ma 1996). Cooperative learning also appears to decrease special education placements (Slavin 1999), classroom anxiety ( Johnson and Johnson 1999; Kagan 1994; Mueller and Fleming 2001; Toumasis 2004), and disciplinary referrals (Slavin 1999), while increasing mathematical confidence ( Johnson and Johnson 1999; Kagan 1994; Toumasis 2004).",14,mtms2010-09-96a,,

"Numerous cooperative learning models are available, such as Slavin’s “student team learning” (1999), Johnson and Johnson’s “learning together” (1999), and Kagan’s “cooperative learning” (1994). Although the melting pot of learning models can be refreshing to stir up and dip into,  Siegel (2005) suggests that teachers focus on one cooperative learning model, believe in it, and internalize its strategies to see successful outcomes in the classroom. I chose to focus on Kagan’s cooperative learning model (1994) in my math classes.",16,mtms2010-09-96a,,
"As I began to put cooperative  learning into practice, I quickly realized that my students needed to break  free of traditional expectations and be taught what it meant to learn in a cooperative group. ",17,mtms2010-09-96a,,
"To work cooperatively, they needed  to learn about it. Throughout the semester, various activities focused on what teaming looks and sounds like. Guidelines were also developed for what a good cooperative team member does and does not do. I also chose to use Kagan’s team-building and class-building activities to create a “positive team identity, liking, respect, and trust among team members and classmates” (Kagan 1994, p. 4). Once students began to get to know one another, the cooperation increased significantly. Taking the time to preteach cooperative learning, prepare students for cooperation, and do team building and class building saved time in the long run. It also provided for a more productive cooperative learning atmosphere.  classRooM conteXt",18,mtms2010-09-96a,,
"My middle school math classes consisted of 73 eighth-grade students. The student population of the school was approximately 45 percent minority, largely Hispanic. About 65 per-  cent of all students qualified for free or reduced-price lunch. My use of cooperative learning occurred in three classrooms with about 25 students each. Core 1 was an accelerated  algebra course for eighth graders. Core 2 and Core 3 were general eighthgrade mathematics courses (Math 8), with one Core 3 class having twice as many students with special education and English language learner (ELL) qualifications as the Core 2 class. In general, the Core 1 algebra class accelerated in mathematics, Core 2 students represented a typical mathematics classroom, and Core 3 students struggled with mathematical content and motivation.

"Involvement in learning can be demonstrated through students’ body language, verbal participation, and social interactions. Involved students have eye contact with the appropriate persons, attempt math problems, ask questions when needing clarification, participate in activities, and are overall active learners.
