0,An Invitation to Contribute - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I have a confession to make. In all my years of teaching middle school math and subscribing to MTMS, I have never submitted a manuscript to the journal. Or to any other journal for that matter. There were always more urgent things to be done: lessons to be planned, tests to be graded, grade books to be updated, and so on. Bus duty, anyone? Lunch duty? Morning duty? Detention duty? You name it, Iâ€™ve volunteered and reported for duty.",,
1,An Invitation to Contribute - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"On top of that, so many articles cited research. Was I supposed to search a library database and find studies that would justify my lesson? I didnâ€™t want to come across as an amateur to the people reading what I might submit. And what about those NCTM publications, besides MTMS, that everyone was citing but that I just hadnâ€™t had time to read?",,
2,An Invitation to Contribute - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In reflecting on my situation, I thought back to some of my favorite pieces from MTMS. I remembered an article about the Integer Target game, created by Jerry Burkhart, a classroom teacher (vol. 12, no. 7). This was a game that he invented and then shared with MTMS readers. I was one reader who used his game in class. I remember a particularly energetic student of mine who just loved math class that day and was (finally!) engaged in class. At the end of that school day, I sent Jerry an email letting him know what a success the game had been in my classes.",,
3,An Invitation to Contribute - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Another favorite article was a Mathematical Explorations piece titled â€œTilted Squares, Irrational Numbers, and the Pythagorean Theoremâ€ by Rachael Eriksen Brown and Alison Owens, a graduate student and a classroom teacher, respectively (vol. 15, no. 1). This article has been the basis of an ever-evolving unit that I still teach every year.",,
4,An Invitation to Contribute - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"A cult favorite among the MTMS Editorial Panel is â€œNever Say Anything a Kid Can Sayâ€ by Steven Reinhart (vol. 5, no. 8). Itâ€™s the kind of piece that you can go back to again and again as a point of reference for best teaching practices. One thing that I noticed about all three pieces: There was nary a parenthetical reference in sight! The authors listed a few works in their bibliographies that inspired their efforts; in some cases, these works were simply other MTMS articles.",,
5,An Invitation to Contribute - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"These are teachers who knew that their own ideas were important enough to be shared with their peers. And somehow, amid all of the urgent work they had to do, they also found time to do important work. Middle school teachers sharing their expertise in the pages of journals like this is important for the health and growth of our profession. So, Iâ€™ll make you a deal. I will submit a manuscript to a professional journal this coming school year. It might not be published. I might cringe at the feedback that reviewers send my way. However, I canâ€™t urge you to submit manuscripts if I donâ€™t put my money where my mouth is.",,
6,An Invitation to Contribute - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In return, I ask that you consider submitting a piece to MTMS. Think of that lesson you have been improving year after year that is so good that your colleagues have adopted it. It might make a great Mathematical Explorations piece. A problem that your students particularly loved to work on last week could be sent for the Palette of Problems. A recent lesson about connecting math to the real world could be submitted to Math for Real. For those of you who read current research on mathematics education, weâ€™d love to hear how it influences your teaching in an article for Informing Practice. Let other MTMS readers know about the good work that you are doing, and give a shout-out to the authors whose pieces have influenced what you do in your classroom.",,
7,An Invitation to Contribute - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Giving credit to those whose work has influenced your own work is required, but citing research studies is not. And if you work in a school that hasnâ€™t adopted the Common Core, you donâ€™t need to reference the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSM) for consideration. The one thing we want to see is evidence of students learning math on the basis of the work they do and the things they say in your classrooms.",,
8,An Invitation to Contribute - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"If you arenâ€™t ready to submit a piece for review, please consider reviewing othersâ€™ manuscripts for MTMS instead. This is another valuable way that you can contribute to making MTMS a great publication. Every manuscript that is published is reviewed by at least four people, one of them being a representative of the Editorial Panel. The feedback that Panel members get from our volunteer reviewers is an essential part of the process.",,
9,An Invitation to Contribute - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"A great volume of MTMS is coming your way this year. The Editorial Panel, volunteer reviewers (like you), and authors have been preparing manuscripts for the past year, and we are excited to see them in print. Now itâ€™s your turn.",,
10,An Invitation to Contribute - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"With thanks for the hard work you will be doing this school year,",,
