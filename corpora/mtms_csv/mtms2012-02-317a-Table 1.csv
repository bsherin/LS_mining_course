"From that point on, I was resolved to make it my mission in my last few years of teaching to eradicate receiving an answer referring to repeating decimals. Don’t get me wrong. I certainly understand the significance and occurrence of repeating decimals in mathematics. However, their meaning is lost to students who merely read the calculator display without using common sense to interpret what they are seeing. My experience in class shows that the rampant use of the calculator is robbing students of two important skills: number sense and reasoning with numbers.",1,mtms2012-02-317a,,
The result of the ubiquitous use  of the calculator is a blind acceptance of any answer it produces. Often I have had to remind students to pass the answer through their brain before committing it to their paper: ,2,mtms2012-02-317a,,

"The answer is the least important part of the problem unless you’re designing a bridge, designing a car, or constructing a model.",6,mtms2012-02-317a,,
"The only legitimate reason for giving a repeating decimal as an answer occurs when the question asks to convert a fraction to a decimal and the decimal is nonterminating. That aside, repeating decimals have no value as an answer to any question we can think of. I often ask my students to give me one example of a repeating decimal in print. No newspaper, magazine, advertisement, novel, legal contract, or story ever contains one. A repeating decimal is as useless as a half-penny coin.",7,mtms2012-02-317a,,
"We must allow students to use  calculators for computations to free them from tedious operations, but unless we also teach them to think, we are doing them a disservice. I have watched students use the calculator to	multiply	2	1/3	by	1	1/5	by	converting the numbers to 2.3 and 1.2. The answer, 2.76, is not nearly as friendly (nor as accurate) a number as the exact	answer	of	2	4/5.	I	rail	against	such	 use of the calculator and insist that fractions be worked out using pencil and paper.",8,mtms2012-02-317a,,
Mathematical literacy and number  sense should be priorities of every math teacher today. Putting an end to “repeating” is one small step toward this goal.,9,mtms2012-02-317a,,
