A Look at the Development of Algebraic Thinking in Curriculum  Focal Points,0,mtms2007-12-266a,,
"Cathy Seeley and  Jane F. Schielack aAs more and more students are  expected to study algebra in middle school or high school, much attention has been given to the development of algebraic reasoning. In Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for School Mathematics (1989), the NCTM advocated incorporating algebraic thinking from the early grades on. Principles and Standards for School Mathematics (2000) further strengthened this stand by highlighting a new  cathy seeley, cseeley@mail.utexas.edu, who is with the Charles A.

"Standard on Representation, a foundational tool for algebra. Whether high school students are expected to enroll in a course called agebra 1 or an integrated high school course that contains algebraic content, it is clear that the United States is placing more emphasis on preparing for the use of algebraic concepts and skills.",4,mtms2007-12-266a,,
"In recognition of the importance  of algebra and algebraic thinking, NCTM’s first Professional Development Focus of the Year explored “Developing Algebraic Thinking: A Journey from Preschool to High School.” A wealth of resources on this topic for elementary, middle, and high school can be found on the NCTM Web site at ww.nctm.org/profdev/ content.aspx?id=4416. ",5,mtms2007-12-266a,,
"In NCTM’s Curriculum Focal Points for Prekindergarten through Grade 8 Mathematics: A Quest for Coherence (2006), algebraic thinking continues to play a key role, appearing as a Focal Point or a Connection throughout the grades. The primary algebraic topics that grow across these grades are the use of patterns leading toward generalizations (especially,  generalizing operations), the study of change, and the development of the use of functions to model relationships. Underlying all these particular topics is the fundamental idea that, for students to be prepared to succeed in algebra, one of the best tools they can have is a deep understanding of the number system, its operations, and the properties related to those operations. Understanding and applying these properties represent students’ first experiences with generalizing about numbers and relationships.",6,mtms2007-12-266a,,
algebraic thinking across the grades,7,mtms2007-12-266a,,
"The use of patterns leading toward generalizations begins from students’ earliest school experiences. In Curriculum Focal Points, the use of patterns begins in the background—as a Connection—in prekindergarten: ",8,mtms2007-12-266a,,
"Algebra: Children recognize and duplicate simple sequential patterns (e.g., square, circle, square, circle, square, circle, . . .). (NCTM 2006, p. 11)",9,mtms2007-12-266a,,
"As in Principles and Standards, the use of patterns to lead to generalizations is a recurring theme across all grade levels, progressing from dealing with number patterns in kindergarten and extending to include properties of operations as students learn basic addition in Grade 1. The Number and Operations and Algebra Focal Point that appear in Grades 2 and 3 include a discussion of generalizing from patterns to properties, shifting to generalizing about models for operations, a key idea in algebra. A word of caution about the use of patterns is appropriate here: In many classrooms, students explore patterns and even describe them with no real awareness of or connection to the important mathematics that the patterns may represent. Like many good ideas, this one can be overdone or inappropriately used. Any time that students are using patterns, the teacher needs to have an explicit idea of where this use is headed and needs to help students eventually connect what they are doing to the important mathematical relationships they are studying. Used well, patterns can be an interesting, engaging, and useful tool to help students understand the number system and, later, expand that understanding to the more abstract realm of algebra.",10,mtms2007-12-266a,,
"Also beginning in Grade 1 is the  use of functions to model relationships. Both a Focal Point and a Connection address a combined look at operations and algebra. Students are asked to use number properties and relationships to model the operations of adding and subtracting as they build a foundation of understanding these operations and their relationship to each other. This modeling extends into Grades 2 and 3 as students begin to address multiplication, including what it means and how it can be used to model certain types of situations. ",11,mtms2007-12-266a,,
"Moving into Grades 4 and 5,  students use patterns to develop an understanding of how a rule can represent relationships, and they move on to writing and solving basic equations. At Grade 5, this attention to equations appears in the background, as a Connection, previewing the more intense work on equations and expressions seen in Grade 6, especially in the Algebra Focal Point.

"Algebra: Writing, interpreting, and using mathematical expressions and equations",13,mtms2007-12-266a,,
"Students write mathematical expressions and equations that correspond to given situations, they evaluate expressions, and they use expressions and formulas to solve problems. They understand that variables represent numbers whose exact values are not yet specified, and they use variables appropriately. Students understand that expressions in different forms can be equivalent, and they can rewrite an expression to represent a quantity in a different way (e.g., to make it more compact or to feature different information). Students know that the solutions of an equation are the values of the variables that make the equation true. They solve simple one-step equations by using number sense, properties of operations, and the idea of maintaining equality on both sides of an equation. They construct and analyze tables (e.g., to show quantities that are in equivalent ratios), and they use equations to describe simple relationships (such as 3x = y) shown in a table.

"Students graph proportional relationships and identify the unit rate as the slope of the related line. They distinguish proportional relationships (y/x = k, or y = kx) from other relationships, including inverse proportionality (xy = k, or  y = k/x). (NCTM 2006, p. 19)",16,mtms2007-12-266a,,

"Focal Points directly address the algebra strand. Algebraic reasoning is in the foreground at this level, and it remains in the foreground into Grade 8. This emphasis represents an important shift from traditional middle school programs that tended to use these middle grades mostly for review of computation. The Grades 6–8 Standards in Principles and Standards describe a middle school program rich in algebraic thinking as embodied by reasoning, modeling, and problem solving.",18,mtms2007-12-266a,,
"Students in the middle grades should learn algebra both as a set of concepts and competencies tied to the representation of quantitative relationships and as a style of mathematical thinking for formalizing patterns, functions, and generalizations. (NCTM 2000, p. 223)",19,mtms2007-12-266a,,

"As with other topics, the mathematical processes are essential for establishing the backdrop for developing algebraic thinking. Reasoning and problem solving are vital in determining how to use mathematics to model a problem or situation before proceeding to solve the problem. Communication continues to be important as both a learning tool (students talking with one another and reflecting on their learning) and as an intended outcome (students communicating the results of projects or in-depth problems to appropriate audiences). Connecting algebra to other strands of the curriculum is helpful for all students and is particularly important in schools where algebra may be a stand-alone course, rather than part of an integrated middle school and high school mathematics program.",25,mtms2007-12-266a,,
The mathematical process most  fundamental to the emerging study of algebra in the Pre-K–8 Focal Points is representation. The Algebra Standard in Principles and Standards states: ,26,mtms2007-12-266a,,
"Instructional programs from prekindergarten through grade 12 should enable all students to represent and analyze mathematical situations and structures using algebraic symbols. (NCTM 2000, p. 37) ",27,mtms2007-12-266a,,
"When students are able to translate fluently among representations (graphic; concrete; tabular; symbolic; or those using words or situations), they are developing essential tools to visualize and represent situations algebraically. One of the biggest stumbling blocks for algebra students in the past has been translating from a word problem or verbal description to an algebraic expression, equation, or graph. If students proceed through a mathematics program that has an emphasis on representation across topics, they will be translating easily among a variety of representations before they ever get to high school, thus increasing their likelihood of success in algebra.  a note about the PrinciPles in PrinCiPlEs anD stanDarDs",28,mtms2007-12-266a,,
"The Equity Principle plays an important role with respect to the development of algebraic thinking and eventual study of algebra 1 in middle school or high school. We see repeated evidence that high school algebra is a gatekeeper course in terms of a student’s mathematical future (Adelman 2006). Whether a student has an opportunity to take algebra has become a significant equity issue in determining who will have access to advanced mathematics taught by a qualified teacher. The development of algebraic thinking described in Principles and Standards and in Curriculum Focal Points can prepare a large, diverse group of students for success in algebra 1, whether taken in high school or in grade 8.

"As with other topics, the other ",30,mtms2007-12-266a,,
"Principles also play a role as a foundation for how we organize and teach mathematics. For algebraic thinking, the Teaching Principle reinforces the importance of representations in teaching and learning:  [W]orthwhile tasks should be intriguing, with a level of challenge that invites speculation and hard work. Such tasks often can be approached in more than one way, such as using an arithmetic counting approach, drawing a geometric diagram and enumerating possibilities, or using algebraic equations, which makes the tasks accessible to students with varied prior knowledge and experience. (NCTM 2000, p. 19)",31,mtms2007-12-266a,,
"In addition, the Technology Principle addresses an important aspect of preparing students for algebra, as described in Curriculum Focal Points. That is, graphing calculators or computers are powerful tools that allow students to see, connect, and use different representations of the same phenomenon, especially graphs and tables.",32,mtms2007-12-266a,,
"For example, with calculators and computers students can examine more examples or representational forms than are feasible by hand, so they can make and explore conjectures easily. The graphic power of technological tools affords access to visual models that are powerful but that many students are unable or unwilling to generate independently.

"The development of algebraic thinking is a rich topic for collaborative discussions. Teachers from prekindergarten through high school can use this context to engage in discussions about how student learning and thinking algebraically can develop from one year to the next. Since this topic was addressed as a Focus of the Year, numerous resources from NCTM are available to support a variety of professional development experiences, from group discussions of journal articles to interactions around  electronic lessons to actual content sessions or workshops. Principles and Standards, Curriculum Focal Points, and Focus of the Year resources provide an extensive professional library on this important topic.  ",34,mtms2007-12-266a,,
Some possible guiding questions for reflection and professional development follow.,35,mtms2007-12-266a,,
"•	 What qualities of algebraic thinking could be addressed at your grade level? To what extent are we now developing these qualities? •	 How does (or can) the use of  patterns become deeper and more complex as students move through the grades, rather than repeating similar exercises of describing and extending patterns? •	 How can the use of patterns be  explicitly connected to mathematical or, specifically, algebraic outcomes without simply telling students what mathematics they are doing? •	 How does the use of manipulative  materials to represent arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) relate to the later use of these operations to create mathematical models of real situations?  •	 How can algebraic reasoning be  used in developing fluency in  computation? •	 How does the concept of change  develop from the early grades through the study of slope in the higher grades? How is this  development the same or different from the development of  proportionality? ",36,mtms2007-12-266a,,
