12,Informing Practice: Predicting Amounts of Change in Quantities,"Heather Lynn Johnson might be measured (e.g., as a cover of a flat surface) (Smith and Thompson 2008; Thompson 1994). It is important to note that envisioning can occur with or without actually measuring the attribute (Smith and Thompson 2008; Thompson 1994). For example, students could predict how the area of a rectangle with a constant base (e.g., rectangle EFGH in fig. 1) would change as the height of the rectangle increased without determining particular amounts of area.",12,Informing Practice: Predicting Amounts of Change in Quantities
13,Informing Practice: Predicting Amounts of Change in Quantities," Analyzing relationships between quantities can support middle-grades students’ reasoning about algebra and function (Ellis 2011; Smith and Thompson 2008). When students focus on relationships between quantities in a function, they are reasoning covariationally (Carlson et al. 2002). A student taking a covariation perspective might think about a function as a special relationship between quantities in which change in one quantity depends on change in another quantity (Chazan 2000). For example, with the growing rectangle, change in the area of rectangle EFGH depends on change in the length of EH. ",13,Informing Practice: Predicting Amounts of Change in Quantities

",15,Informing Practice: Predicting Amounts of Change in Quantities
16,Informing Practice: Predicting Amounts of Change in Quantities,Problems such as this require  students to make sense of relationships between quantities that change together. The Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSI 2010) identified reasoning about quantities—“make sense of quantities and their relationships in problem situations” (p. 6)—as one of eight Mathematical Practices for students to develop. This article provides an example of how students can make sense of relationships  between area and length as they work on a rectangle-resizing problem. ,16,Informing Practice: Predicting Amounts of Change in Quantities

Linear functions can be viewed as a special kind of relationship between amounts of change in quantities. A focus on relationships is more powerful than simply associating a linear function with a graph shaped like a line. From a covariation perspective, the growing rectangle situation is linear because a particular amount of change in the length of EH will produce a consistent amount of change in the area of rectangle EFGH, regardless of the length of EH.",23,Informing Practice: Predicting Amounts of Change in Quantities
24,Informing Practice: Predicting Amounts of Change in Quantities,"Students often have to wait until  calculus to study the mathematics of change (Roschelle, Kaput, and Stroup 2000).

31,Informing Practice: Predicting Amounts of Change in Quantities,"My variable table contained varying amounts of change from one value of the length of side EH to the next. For an example, see Marta’s work in figure 3. The values included for  the length of side EH were 3 cm,  5 cm, 7 cm, 9 cm, 10 cm, and  12 cm. Most increments in consecutive values were 2 cm, but one pair of consecutive values had a change of 1 cm. Previous research (Ellis 2007) has shown that students working with well-ordered tables pay attention to changes in only one quantity  rather than relating changes in both quantities. ",31,Informing Practice: Predicting Amounts of Change in Quantities
32,Informing Practice: Predicting Amounts of Change in Quantities,Marta’s work with the variable  table is an example of a student who related changes in both quantities.

Focusing students’ attention on such relationships could help them draw on that information to make predictions. Marta’s work on the table (see   fig. 3) did not include units for amounts of change in side length (+1, +2) or area (+6).

52,Informing Practice: Predicting Amounts of Change in Quantities,"Given students’ general success  with the task, it might seem like either method is just as useful as the other. However,	students’	use	of	different	 methods suggests important differences in their reasoning. Students who employ method (1) use only calculated  rectangle areas to find amounts of change in area. In contrast, students using method (2) are viewing the problem from a covariation perspective, meaning that they can use a change in the length of EH to predict an amount of change in the area of EFGH.",52,Informing Practice: Predicting Amounts of Change in Quantities
53,Informing Practice: Predicting Amounts of Change in Quantities,"Although method (2) might seem preferable for its efficiency, that is not the heart of the issue. Method (2) involves making predictions about changes in area by examining changes in side length, regardless of specific side lengths, which is of overriding importance.
