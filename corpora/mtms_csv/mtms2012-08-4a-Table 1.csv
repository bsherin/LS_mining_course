introduction,7,mtms2012-08-4a,,
"Welcome to Volume 18 aAs you pack away the sunscreen and  swimsuits, I hope that you find yourself re-energized and ready for the new school year. At summer’s end, I find myself longing for the classroom and my new students, armed with freshly sharpened pencils and newly purchased blank notebooks, both to be used to pursue knowledge. I know that each new school year brings new students, unforeseen challenges, and untold triumphs. And after thirteen years in the classroom, I still get butterflies in my stomach before the first day of school.",8,mtms2012-08-4a,,
"As I contemplate what this new school year will bring, I think about our new, fresh-faced teachers at the helm of their very own classroom for the first time. Our newest teachers bring enthusiasm, eagerness, and energy to the classroom, which help  remind me why I started teaching in the first place. Over the last decade, I have had the opportunity to mentor teachers during their first year. Each time, I offer the same advice:  Do not take yourself too seriously; try to laugh every day; and never hesitate to ask for help, especially from the veteran teachers in your building.",9,mtms2012-08-4a,,
"Some days will be difficult, but  remember that the most worthwhile accomplishments in our lives are the ones that we work the hardest to achieve. Middle school students bring a unique kind of energy to the classroom: Harness their energy to help build on your own. ",10,mtms2012-08-4a,,
"Our veteran teachers bring the  knowledge and wisdom that has  been cultivated over many years of working with students, teachers, and administrators. I have learned more than I could ever imagine from my esteemed veteran colleagues, both in the classroom and at the university. Their guidance has helped shape the educator I am today. That said, we all have more to learn. Many changes are in the pipeline for education involving the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSM) and the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) initiatives. The Editorial Panel of MTMS encourages readers to use the journal as a resource for these new initiatives. We are especially looking forward to this volume year’s focus issue: “Mathematics in a STEM Context.” We hope that teachers find the journal full of new and useful ideas that can be used in the classroom every day.",11,mtms2012-08-4a,,
"MTMS will continue to deliver  ready-to-use classroom activities and problems through the departments in the journal. In addition, the Editorial Panel of MTMS is looking forward to a new volume year of exciting and interesting articles. As always, we would love to hear from you, the teachers in the trenches. Your feedback helps to stimulate this journal and make it even better. ",12,mtms2012-08-4a,,
"To all of our new and veteran  teachers and all the amazing educators in between, the Editorial Panel of MTMS wishes you a wonderful new school year. ",13,mtms2012-08-4a,,
