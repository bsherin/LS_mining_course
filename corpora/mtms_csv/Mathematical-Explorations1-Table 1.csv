2,Mathematical Explorations: A New Twist on Collaborative Learning,"Research on students’ learning has made it clear that learning happens through an interaction with others and through communication. In the classroom, the more students talk and discuss their ideas, the more they learn. However, within a one-hour period, it is hard to give everyone an equal opportunity to talk and share their ideas. Organizing students in groups distributes classroom talk more widely and equitably (Cohen and Lotan 1997).  innovative ways for students to learn together. Reworking the activity allowed my math students to better collaborate and communicate with one another.",2,Mathematical Explorations: A New Twist on Collaborative Learning

4,Mathematical Explorations: A New Twist on Collaborative Learning,"To introduce this group activity, students are instructed to communicate through writing, rather than verbally. Students are generally prone to talk, so the expectation of no talking must be explicit and clear. Each group of students is given a large sheet of white paper containing the tasks or questions to be answered while working through the activity sheet. (Full instructions on implementation are outlined in the sidebar.) Students will each be given a different colored marker, thus providing a way to differentiate contributions among them and to check for full group participation. The students must understand that all colors in their group are to be evenly represented, showing equal participation from all group members.",4,Mathematical Explorations: A New Twist on Collaborative Learning

6,Mathematical Explorations: A New Twist on Collaborative Learning,"Through actively communicating and sharing ideas, students learn collaboratively. Although I promote this type of learning in my classroom, it is challenging to make sure that each student is participating, learning, and engaging in the activity. I look for tasks that will ensure that students are accomplishing the desired learning goals and being held accountable for their learning.

7,Mathematical Explorations: A New Twist on Collaborative Learning,"After observing a Reading Apprenticeship Program, a fellow teacher shared a new learning activity with me called “Let the chalk do the talk.” It means essentially what it says: Let students communicate through writing rather than speaking.

I write prompts on their work such as these: •  “Each what?” •  “Be more specific.” •  “What is this?” •  “Show your math.”",9,Mathematical Explorations: A New Twist on Collaborative Learning
10,Mathematical Explorations: A New Twist on Collaborative Learning,"Just as the students are not allowed to talk, I remain silent throughout the activity as well. It is quite remarkable to see a classroom full of middle schoolers fully engaged through written mathematical arguments and conversations. ",10,Mathematical Explorations: A New Twist on Collaborative Learning
11,Mathematical Explorations: A New Twist on Collaborative Learning,KEY PRINCIPLES FOR SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION The following three principles will help with students’ learning.,11,Mathematical Explorations: A New Twist on Collaborative Learning
12,Mathematical Explorations: A New Twist on Collaborative Learning,"1. Choose a good math task. NCTM’s Principles and Standards for School Mathematics (2000), as well as other mathematics education reform documents, highlight the influence of curricular tasks on what students learn in math class. Thus, the main task used for this activity can either undermine or maximize the opportunities for students’ learning. First and foremost, the math task included in this activity must elicit mathematical conversations and arguments among the students. The purpose is to allow students the opportunity to engage in mathematical discussions. Therefore, if the activity does not accomplish this goal, it may not be the right math task. Notice that the task  presented in the activity sheet  (see p. 57) is set up for argumentation rather than straight computation. Tasks that present several sides to the math problem or multiple modes of thinking are especially important when we begin using this group activity with students.",12,Mathematical Explorations: A New Twist on Collaborative Learning
13,Mathematical Explorations: A New Twist on Collaborative Learning,Using the Activity Sheet,13,Mathematical Explorations: A New Twist on Collaborative Learning
14,Mathematical Explorations: A New Twist on Collaborative Learning,Preparation 1. Use this activity with lessons pertaining to the surface area and volume   of rectangular prisms.,14,Mathematical Explorations: A New Twist on Collaborative Learning
15,Mathematical Explorations: A New Twist on Collaborative Learning,2. Print and cut out questions 1 –4 separately. Spread them out and glue   the questions on a large sheet of white paper to allow room for responses and discussions.,15,Mathematical Explorations: A New Twist on Collaborative Learning
16,Mathematical Explorations: A New Twist on Collaborative Learning,3. Introduce question 5 as a challenge. It is meant to get students thinking  about finding the volume and surface area of figures other than rectangular prisms. Glue this question on the back of the sheet of paper. ,16,Mathematical Explorations: A New Twist on Collaborative Learning
17,Mathematical Explorations: A New Twist on Collaborative Learning,Implementing the Activity 1. Separate students into groups of 4 or 5. Set up the table so that multiple  students are able to read and write on the paper simultaneously.  2. Give each student a different colored marker.,17,Mathematical Explorations: A New Twist on Collaborative Learning
18,Mathematical Explorations: A New Twist on Collaborative Learning,3. Set a timer or give students a specific amount of time to work on the task.,18,Mathematical Explorations: A New Twist on Collaborative Learning
19,Mathematical Explorations: A New Twist on Collaborative Learning,4. Use a black marker to interact with the students on their paper.,19,Mathematical Explorations: A New Twist on Collaborative Learning
20,Mathematical Explorations: A New Twist on Collaborative Learning,5. Continue the activity until you feel that students have had sufficient math  discussions and have reached conclusions about surface area and volume. ,20,Mathematical Explorations: A New Twist on Collaborative Learning

27,Mathematical Explorations: A New Twist on Collaborative Learning,"Back 2. Focus on familiar content. Another principle to consider is how familiar students are with the material covered in the task. Students are more likely to generate deep and meaningful discussions if they have previously explored the material at hand. For example, after having time to think about the concepts of surface area and volume for one class period, I followed up the next day with a “Let the chalk do the talk” activity. It required students to determine if they were being asked to find surface area or volume and which container would hold more of an object (see the activity sheet). Consider assigning a warm-up set of questions to remind students of the concepts they will be  working with during the activity. ",27,Mathematical Explorations: A New Twist on Collaborative Learning
28,Mathematical Explorations: A New Twist on Collaborative Learning,"I used the following journal   questions to set up the “Let the chalk do the talk” activity featured on the activity sheet:  a.  In your own words, describe how to find the surface area of a box; and b.  In your own words, describe how  to find the volume of a box.  ",28,Mathematical Explorations: A New Twist on Collaborative Learning
29,Mathematical Explorations: A New Twist on Collaborative Learning,"Although students had only one day to explore these topics, they were able to have meaningful discussions and struggle through the problem together. Students do not need to have extensive knowledge of the concept, but they will need to be familiar with ",29,Mathematical Explorations: A New Twist on Collaborative Learning
30,Mathematical Explorations: A New Twist on Collaborative Learning,Fig. 1 Students rely on the teacher’s question on their initial work to get them through the task.,30,Mathematical Explorations: A New Twist on Collaborative Learning
31,Mathematical Explorations: A New Twist on Collaborative Learning,"the tools, skills, and understanding to access the task.",31,Mathematical Explorations: A New Twist on Collaborative Learning
32,Mathematical Explorations: A New Twist on Collaborative Learning,"3. Promote productive struggle. An element of “struggle” occurs when students are engaged in this activity because it forces them to use the only resources available to them: markers, one another, their own personal knowledge, and limited help from the teacher. This activity must challenge students to think, explore, investigate, question, and discuss through writing rather than speaking. When looking for a task that will promote productive struggle for students, I have found that an open-ended task is essential. The questions must be phrased so that students have to search and investigate to figure out how to solve or work through each problem, rather than simply using numbers and operations. If the task is too straightforward, students will become disengaged, bored, and distracted. The goal of this activity is not for students to complete a set of problems but to mathematically investigate and engage in mathematical conversations.",32,Mathematical Explorations: A New Twist on Collaborative Learning
33,Mathematical Explorations: A New Twist on Collaborative Learning,"21st CENTURY SKILLS AND MATHEMATICAL PRACTICES “Let the chalk do the talk” allows students time to interact with several mathematical practices by learning to precisely state mathematical arguments and explanations, persevere in solving mathematical problems, and be fully engaged in the activity. This activity also gives students the opportunity to practice several 21st century skills, including creativity and innovation, communication, collaboration, and effective problem solving (SKILLS21).",33,Mathematical Explorations: A New Twist on Collaborative Learning
34,Mathematical Explorations: A New Twist on Collaborative Learning,"The Standards for Mathematical Practice (SMP) that are integral to the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSI 2010) are also in play. The first to be used is SMP 1: “Make sense of problems and  (a) (b) (c) persevere in solving them” (p. 6). If I give my students a challenging group task, they also receive brief instructions and prompts. When I release them to work on the task, their hands shoot up immediately, and they make such comments as “I don’t get this. I don’t know what to do.”",34,Mathematical Explorations: A New Twist on Collaborative Learning
35,Mathematical Explorations: A New Twist on Collaborative Learning,"During “Let the chalk do the talk,”  students may face a few moments of silence—or no writing—while they attempt to figure out how they could set up and solve the given problem. However, once someone writes down the first comment or question, they start to write questions for their group mates, and it engages their minds. I have found that students rely on one another during this written activity (see fig. 1), whereas during a verbal group task, they tend to ask me more questions and rely on my help to get them through the task. ",35,Mathematical Explorations: A New Twist on Collaborative Learning
36,Mathematical Explorations: A New Twist on Collaborative Learning,"For this particular activity, students  were shown two different popcorn containers and had to respond to the claim that one container held more popcorn than the other. Students were not told how to solve the problem or what to find to figure it out. This group demonstrated SMP 1; the students persevered in solving this problem by considering what important information would help them determine which container holds more popcorn.",36,Mathematical Explorations: A New Twist on Collaborative Learning
37,Mathematical Explorations: A New Twist on Collaborative Learning,"SMP 3 naturally occurs next: “Construct viable arguments and  critique the reasoning of others”  (CCSSI 2010, p. 6). When learning math, students should not simply accept but should work at being convinced to deeply understand what they are learning. They should explore, question, argue, and engage in conversations about the material they learn. This activity gives students the opportunity to engage in mathematical arguments because they are forced to clearly explain their thoughts through writing. It is not enough to end a ",37,Mathematical Explorations: A New Twist on Collaborative Learning

40,Mathematical Explorations: A New Twist on Collaborative Learning,"Individual students are not able  to vocally dominate the conversation. Instead, every voice is heard through written comments and thoughts. When having a verbal conversation, sometimes it is hard to remember what was said, how something was proven, and what conclusion was ultimately discovered. “Let the chalk do the talk,” however, gives students space in which to argue concepts with one another and to critique arguments and findings.",40,Mathematical Explorations: A New Twist on Collaborative Learning
41,Mathematical Explorations: A New Twist on Collaborative Learning,"SMP 6, “Attend to precision”   (CCSSI 2010, p. 7), is the next instruction given. To effectively construct and critique arguments, students must focus on stating ideas precisely and encouraging one another to be more specific in their comments as well. Coupled with verbal conversations is often the fear of speaking against one another or questioning a peer’s response. Writing down thoughts and comments allows students to see what their thoughts look like on paper. It is easier to spot holes in ideas and find places in which more precision and specificity is required. As teachers, we often work to pull ",41,Mathematical Explorations: A New Twist on Collaborative Learning
