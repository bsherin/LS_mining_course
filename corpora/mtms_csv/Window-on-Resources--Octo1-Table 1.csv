17,Window on Resources  October 2014,"Dice Activities for Algebraic Thinking was written as a fun and challenging way for students in grades 5–8 to explore algebra by using dice and colored tiles. This book comes with a CD that can be easily used on an interactive board for classroom use or to introduce a game. The concepts of the games include patterns, relationships, functions, and symbolic representations. Mathematical background information as well as answer keys are provided. ",17,Window on Resources  October 2014
18,Window on Resources  October 2014,"I was able to use many of the  games with my sixth-grade students with great success. Some activities were used before introducing a new concept, and other games were used to reinforce their learning. Students were able to understand the directions fairly easily, although I recommend modeling a game before sending students off in teams. Because the games were challenging for many students, guidance was often needed from a teacher before students felt comfortable working on their own. ",18,Window on Resources  October 2014
19,Window on Resources  October 2014,"The book is written to be used with  students in grades 5–8. I found that many of the activities use concepts that may not be appropriate for younger grades. Concepts such as summation,  negative exponents, and factorials are generally not introduced until later grades. However, several of the activities can be modified so that those concepts are excluded from the game.",19,Window on Resources  October 2014
20,Window on Resources  October 2014,I recommend this book to challenge and develop students’ algebraic thinking. It would probably best serve grades 7 and higher.,20,Window on Resources  October 2014

27,Window on Resources  October 2014,Activities is an activity book for teachers of grades 5– 9. Its stated goal is to provide reading and writing activities to help students learn  mathematics at a deeper level. ,27,Window on Resources  October 2014
28,Window on Resources  October 2014,"The activity pages can be photocopied for immediate use and provide research-based strategies. Some examples are the “compare-contrast matrix,” “concept circles,” “Frayer model,” “word maps,” and “What’s Your Rule?” investigations. The author applies these strategies to important prealgebra topics: properties of real numbers, integers, divisibility, fractions/decimals/percents, equations and inequalities, and interpreting graphs. ",28,Window on Resources  October 2014
29,Window on Resources  October 2014,"Other topics, such as the dissection  proof of the Pythagorean theorem,  which requires a student to respond to (a|b)? seem beyond the scope of a prealgebra activity book. ",29,Window on Resources  October 2014
30,Window on Resources  October 2014,"This book has potential to be a useful resource, but I cannot recommend it at this printing because it contains too many errors. Spelling errors (such as greatest common denominator instead of greatest common divisor) and typos (such as 102 = 100 instead of 102 = 100) are annoying, but mathematical errors in an investigation activity page can cause serious misconceptions. For example, students are given the task of determining “What’s Your Rule?” after studying examples of using exponent laws. Students who study errors such as (x2)3 = x5 will likely develop misunderstandings that the activity should seek to prevent.  —Mary Beth Rollick",30,Window on Resources  October 2014

40,Window on Resources  October 2014,"This book offers several great examples of tasks that engage students in the Standards for Mathematical Practice (SMP), found  in the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics. For example, the number webs discussed in chapter 3 provide readers with a way to engage students in reasoning abstractly and quantitatively. This and other examples are easy to understand, seem easy to implement, and require students to think at a high cognitive level. This text, with the thought- provoking tasks and vignettes, offers teachers a great resource for teaching in a way that engages students with the SMP. Tasks are provided for varying grade levels so that teachers across the elementary grades and middle grades can use this as a resource. ",40,Window on Resources  October 2014
41,Window on Resources  October 2014,"This text overall has three major  strengths. First, the vignettes provide teachers with examples for how task implementation might progress. Second, the tasks are at a high cognitive level so that students are engaging in the SMP and in cognitively demanding mathematics. Third, the tables at the end of each chapter clearly identify practices for teachers that engage their students in the SMP. One major weakness is  that the  authors interpreted SMP 4 (model with mathematics) as emphasizing representations. However, this standard has an emphasis on context, which the authors did not really address. ",41,Window on Resources  October 2014
42,Window on Resources  October 2014,I would recommend that any  teacher or teacher educator purchase this text as a way to support students’ engagement with the SMP.,42,Window on Resources  October 2014

54,Window on Resources  October 2014,"Although the activities in this  book do plumb a depth of thinking, the format of the book is not inviting or user-friendly for most teachers. The activities build algebraic thinking in a way that should allow the variables to provide meaning for the student. However, the teacher pages are somewhat confusing. Although they sometimes give suggestions for ways to begin asking good questions for use with students, the detail on the development of the concept lacks readability. ",54,Window on Resources  October 2014
55,Window on Resources  October 2014,The student pages only sometimes appropriately lead students through the discovery. Much of the information required to make these investigations work needs to be done outside of the activity by the teacher. ,55,Window on Resources  October 2014

57,Window on Resources  October 2014,"The CD that is included with this text should be a great asset because it should allow a teacher to print a particular activity to then work on with students.
