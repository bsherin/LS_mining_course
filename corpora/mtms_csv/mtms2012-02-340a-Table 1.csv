"Divide Across mMuch attention has been devoted in the literature to students’ struggles with fraction division. With regard to the traditional invert and multiply algorithm, researchers and educators have examined such areas as typical errors, how to help students understand why this method works, and what alternatives are available that might be more intuitive (Coughlin 2010; Li 2008; Sharp and Adams 2002; Tirosh 2000). A common theme to this work has been an emphasis on reasoning and sense making (NCTM 2000). ",7,mtms2012-02-340a,,
"This emphasis on sense making in mathematics is not new; educators have been advocating for its place in education for many decades (e.g., Brownell 1947; Skemp 1978; NCTM 2000). Those advocates note that students should see mathematics as something to be reasoned about; the acts of making conjectures, asking why, and justifying conclusions should be viewed as natural processes when learning about and doing mathematics (NCTM 2000).",8,mtms2012-02-340a,,
"One approach to helping students reason about mathematics is to support them in constructing their own methods for solving problems. Research has suggested that when students are encouraged to fi nd new strategies for solving fraction division word problems, they do not choose the invert and multiply method. When making sense of contextualized problems, Sharp and Adams (2002) found that students were more likely to invent the common denominator method: When dividing fractions with the same denominator, the quotient can be found by dividing the numerators. For example: ÷ =÷ = ÷ = 6 2÷ = 6 2 3 6 2",9,mtms2012-02-340a,,
"If the denominators are different, then fi nding a common denominator would be the fi rst step. ",10,mtms2012-02-340a,,
"A typical Chinese textbook also uses contextualized problems; however, these problems are sequenced in a way that leads to the invert and multiply method. According to Li (2008), such textbooks use word problems to help students establish the meaning of fraction division and make connections between division and multiplication. A key element of the Chinese approach is its emphasis on solving problems in more than one way. By solving problems in two ways, students are guided to conclude that dividing by a whole number and multiplying by its reciprocal are equivalent processes. ",11,mtms2012-02-340a,,
This article will address an important but often overlooked question:  “Why not just divide across?” ,12,mtms2012-02-340a,,
"If students apply their knowledge of multiplying by fractions, as well as the relationship between multiplying and dividing, then a reasonable conjecture would be to divide the numerators and then divide the denominators. Why isn’t that the accepted method? By not addressing this question before guiding students to a standard approach, students’ sense of what is reasonable may be undermined. Students may even believe that dividing across is not a viable method when in fact it is. ",13,mtms2012-02-340a,,
"A study by Tirosh supports this notion. Tirosh asked preservice teachers whether or not it was acceptable to divide across in a manner similar to fraction multiplication. Specifi cally, she asked,",14,mtms2012-02-340a,,

"In her study, preservice  teachers were surprised to fi nd  that the divide-across method worked when they chose particular values for a, b, c, and d. Having never been asked to consider this method, these preservice teachers assumed that it would not work in all cases. As one preservice teacher in the study noted, “No. It’s impossible. If it was correct, why would anyone use the complicated invert-and-multiply algorithm?” (Tirosh 2000, p. 14). After further consideration, the preservice teachers realized that divide across did work but that some values of a, b, c, and d made it much too complicated (e.g., when a was not divisible by c). On the other hand, invert and multiply worked similarly in all cases.",16,mtms2012-02-340a,,
"We describe our experiences in helping upper-elementary students understand fraction division. As part of this process, we were interested in whether or not students were inclined to divide across when asked to conjecture about fraction division for the fi rst time. If students were inclined to use this method, how might we help them understand why this method is not always optimal and that invert and multiply is a viable alternative?  conteXt",17,mtms2012-02-340a,,
"The eleven students described in this article were part of a sixth-grade class in a small private school for students with language-based learning differences. Despite their learning differences, the teacher believed that students should reason about mathematics. Students were frequently asked to make conjectures, and they had to be able to explain and justify their thinking. ",18,mtms2012-02-340a,,
"The main part of her lessons  usually involved investigating and constructing understanding of the content through contexts, activities, and manipulatives. Students were explicitly told what they were going to do and why it was important. The activities were modeled so that students  would understand the directions they were given. Then, depending on the activity or lesson’s objective, the students worked independently, in pairs, or in small groups.  estaBlishing the diVide acRoss Method",19,mtms2012-02-340a,,
"On the day that division with fractions was introduced, class began with a review of methods for multiplying with fractions (e.g., a fraction times a whole number, a mixed number times a mixed number). Students noted that one method worked in all cases; namely, they could write each factor as a fraction and then multiply numerators and denominators. To conclude the chapter, the teacher helped students create a generalization for this rule. It stated that, for nonzero values of b and d, ",20,mtms2012-02-340a,,

Students were then asked to solve  the following problem in their journals:  21 ÷ =÷ = ?,23,mtms2012-02-340a,,
"Surprisingly, all eleven students  agreed that the answer was 4/7. (New problems in this class were typically not resolved so easily.) One student explained that 8 ÷ 2 = 4 and 21 ÷ 3 = 7, and the others agreed. The dividing across approach seemed to be intuitive for these students. After four more examples of this type were completed without diffi culty, the students were asked to try something a little more complicated: 1÷ 222 = ?",24,mtms2012-02-340a,,
"Most of the students struggled  with this problem. Many had remainders in their answer, such as  and were uncertain how to continue. “What’s the problem with this one?” asked the teacher. A student offered, “Well, the top one does not have a remainder, but the bottom one has a remainder.” The class period ended without a resolution to the problem. However, student journals revealed that one student (Eric) found a solution. He rewrote 3/5 as 6/10 and then divided across, as shown below: ÷ =÷ = 10 ÷ =÷ =",25,mtms2012-02-340a,,
"Work continued on this question  the next instructional day. Since many students had 2R1 in the denominator, rather than 2 1/2, students were helped to make a connection between 5 ÷ 2 and 2 1/2. Students worked in pairs to discuss their attempts to solve this unresolved division problem. The teacher again asked, “What makes this problem so much more  diffi cult to fi gure out?” Once again, a student pointed to the fact that the denominators did not divide evenly. The teacher then asked for a multiple of 5 that would be divisible by 2. After a student suggested 10 for the denominator, Eric offered his method of rewriting 3/5 as 6/10. The teacher prompted him to explain why he did not multiply 3/5 by 4/4 or 6/6: “Why is 2/2 the easier form of 1 to use?” Eric responded, “Because it comes out to be smaller numbers.”",26,mtms2012-02-340a,,
"Once 3/5 was rewritten as 6/10, the  students agreed that the divide across method was easy to employ and that the quotient was 6/5. Because this method was not the one initially used by the majority of the students, the teacher then asked how to show that  was equivalent to 6/5. When one student suggested multiplying by 2/2, another student asked for confi rmation: “You can do that because two halves is a form of one, right?” The teacher responded affi rmatively and explained that 2/2 is a form of 1 and that it is possible to multiply anything by 1 and not change its value; the representation is an easier number to deal with. This idea had been thoroughly explored in prior chapters.",27,mtms2012-02-340a,,
"After a brief summary of both  methods, students were asked to solve 4/9 ÷ 1/5 and write the solution in their journals. This time, students tended to use Eric’s method for solving the problem. Many students approached it this way: ÷ =÷ = 20 45 ÷ =÷ = 20",28,mtms2012-02-340a,,
"When asked to use the other  method (i.e., divide across and then simplify), students again had diffi culty writing an appropriate mixed number  for the denominator. However, after they determined that the denominator was 1 4/5, students were asked what form of 1 could be used to show that the entire fraction was equivalent to 20/9 (i.e., the quotient found using Eric’s method). In other words, they needed to show: ÷ =÷ =÷÷ =÷ 20",29,mtms2012-02-340a,,

"Although students were able to  verify that dividing across worked for this problem, they all agreed that the method was too complicated. With more and varied examples, they eventually decided that even Eric’s method (i.e., fi nd an equivalent fraction and then divide across) was often too complicated. By this time, they were primed to discover a method of dividing fractions that was simple and that worked well in all cases. Although the divide across method was intuitive and simple, students soon found it tedious to implement. ",34,mtms2012-02-340a,,

"One suggestion at this point would be to help students understand how to fi nd an equivalent fraction for the dividend that makes it easy to divide across. For example, the numerator and denominator of the dividend could be multiplied by the product of the numerator and denominator in the divisor. For a divisor c/d, the dividend would be multiplied by cd/cd: ÷ =÷ =÷÷ =÷",36,mtms2012-02-340a,,
"Although this approach would  work well for some students, the skills and needs of this particular group led the teacher in a different direction. To begin, contextualized problems and manipulatives were used to help students understand the meaning of fraction division and to combat the misconception that, for division, the quotient is always smaller than the dividend (Graeber and Baker 1992). ",37,mtms2012-02-340a,,
"The students also compared  equivalent multiplication and division problems. For example, students found that 4 ÷ 4 has the same value as 4 × 1/4 and that 24 ÷ 2 has the same value as 24 × 1/2. They also divided by unit fractions and eventually nonunit fractions. After working through many problems, students were able to conclude that dividing by a number was equivalent to multiplying by that number’s reciprocal (see Li 2008). This idea was generalized as  ÷ =÷ = a c×a c× d b c×b c× d ÷ =÷ = a d×a d× b c×b c× ÷ =÷ = ×",38,mtms2012-02-340a,,

"After learning to invert and multiply, students were asked (during a warmup exercise) to— 1.  solve 15/27 ÷ 5/3 in two different ways and explain which method they preferred; and 2.  choose a preferred method to solve 8/9 ÷ 3/4 and explain why they made that choice. ",40,mtms2012-02-340a,,
"Two students were absent the day of the warm-up exercise. Although the other nine preferred and successfully used invert and multiply for the second problem, only three students preferred that method for the fi rst problem. Those students suggested that, in general, multiplication was easier for them than division. The other six suggested that it was “faster” or “quicker” to divide across for the fi rst problem. See ﬁ gure 1 for an example of student work on these problems.",41,mtms2012-02-340a,,
"At the end of their work with  fractions, students were given a fi nal assessment that included a sampling of problems from the unit. When they were asked to divide two fractions that could easily be solved by either method (i.e., 9/14 ÷ 1/7), the approaches were again mixed. Five students correctly used the divide across method; three used the invert and multiply method; and one person used both, presumably as a way to check her work. Two students did not use a correct method. ",42,mtms2012-02-340a,,

came to the understanding that invert and multiply was more efficient (and actually less complicated) for some division problems. Several students demonstrated flexible knowledge of division and shifted from one method to another depending on the particular circumstances. Such flexibility had not been typical of students in this learning difference class.,46,mtms2012-02-340a,,
"To this teacher, asking students “Why?” was always a powerful tool for helping them understand invert and multiply. However, when she allowed students to conjecture about division, they were inclined to use a method not typically taught in school. By allowing students to explore this method and why it is not used, she found that she was able to support their intuition while also deepening their understanding and reflectivity about fractions.",47,mtms2012-02-340a,,
"Asking “Why not?” seemed to help all the students in this class. Those who were mathematically strong seemed to become more attentive to a problem’s conditions, more open to using alternate methods, and more willing to justify their choices. What was most encouraging was that some who had struggled the most with mathematics were able to independently analyze a problem and determine which method—divide across or invert and multiply—would be most appropriate. They were also able to justify their choices. By analyzing when one method worked more effectively than another for solving a division problem, students began to feel more confident in their ability to be successful with fractions.
