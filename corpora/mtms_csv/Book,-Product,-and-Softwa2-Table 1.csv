5,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1)","Wendy Ward Hoffer wrote Developing Literate Mathematicians: A Guide for Integrating Language and Literacy Instruction into Secondary Mathematics to help secondary math teachers see the need for purposeful inclusion of literacy instruction in mathematics as well as to describe manageable ways to begin including it in their classes. After making the case for mathematical literacy, Hoffer then elaborates at length to help the hesitant teacher learn how to structure  literacy learning in his or her classroom. She does this by systematically exploring the different facets of literacy, such as speaking, reading, and writing, through the workshop model. Each of these facets is illustrated using examples that any secondary math teacher can relate to. In addition, the links to the Common Core as well as NCTMs Teaching Practices are clearly drawn.",,
6,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1)","Hoffer has a clear, almost conversational way of writing, and I immensely enjoyed this book. I greatly appreciated the careful way that she linked each facet of literacy to classroom practices, with enough elaboration to make it seem doable, as well as the section at the end of each chapter titled, Yeah, but. . . that voiced many of the same uncertainties I would anticipate from reluctant teachers.",,
7,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1)","The examples that she provided were good, although more instances from higher math courses would have been appreciated. A secondary teacher could easily implement her suggestions in a classroom to improve students mathematical literacy.",,
8,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1)","Overall, the book is a great read with a sound research base, practical applications to practice, and excellent resources!",,

15,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1)","About Teaching Mathematics is a book for K8 educators that responds to the struggles that teachers wrestle with in the classroom when trying to balance procedural skills with developing deep conceptual understanding. Marilyn Burns not only addresses mathematical content, assessment, and strategies but also offers math commentary. Thought-bubble icons are dispersed throughout the investigations section to provide further explanations.",,
16,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1)","She presents a plethora of whole-class, small-group, and independent investigations that are ready to use. This book is not meant to be read cover to cover but rather is a go-to resource for teachers. Burns connects theory to practice and offers ideas for joining English language arts to math instruction. A link to a compilation of childrens books is also included. Responses to previously posed questions by teachers as well as information on where over forty reproducibles can be downloaded are other items that are part of About Teaching Mathematics.",,
17,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1)","A strong feature of the book is all the sticky notes written by Burns that discuss teaching tips, give management suggestions, list references where teachers can find more information about a topic, and provide some additional thoughts.",,
18,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1)","This informative and resourceful book, which is well worth its cost, can be used by teachers and preservice teachers, professional learning communities, and book study groups, as well as for professional development purposes. It is truly versatile in its potential uses in part because it is written by such a respected educator in the mathematics community.",,

24,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1)","This book is intended to provide exploration and extension activities for grades 58 students. It focuses on measurement and polygon standards, emphasizing the mathematical practice standards. Each activity is also associated with two to four content standards, most spanning multiple grade levels. For someone with a math background, some of the teacher notes will be obvious and unnecessary; however, for many grades 5 and 6 teachers, with K6 certification, math is not their background focus. For them, the tips and suggestions in this book are spot on and make connections that nonmath people might miss. Another area of interest is the support the book provides for classroom discussions.",,
25,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1)","Another strength of Advanced Common Core Math Explorations is that it provides extensions for each of the nine activities in the book. Every activity includes an introduction; a student handout; an extremely detailed, thorough answer key; and a wrap up. One weakness is that there is a lot of reading and preparation to do before a teacher can use a lesson. If a teachers is looking for a book that he or she can open and pull a lesson from, this is not the book. I would highly recommend this book to teachers who are willing to take the time to do the lessons ahead of time, looking to extend their own knowledge and connections of the mathematics involved, and trying to push their students to dig deeper into the Common Cores Standards for Mathematical Practice.",,

31,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1)",DIY Project Based Learning for Math and Science is a toolbox for teachers who are implementing PBL. Heather Wolpert-Gawron has created PBL tools that are versatile enough to be applied to almost any unitfrom science to math and beyond.,,
32,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1)","WolpertGawron showed her insight into a teachers mind by saving her toolbox (i.e., the Mix-and-Match Lessons) for Part II. A toolbox is overwhelming if one has not seen a context for the tools use. Wisely, she used Part I, which contains five PBL units, to highlight each of the tools found in Part II. Her writing style makes you feel as if she has invited you to sit with her and talk at a coffee shop. Part IIs Mix-and-Math Lesson materials are available as free eResources.",,
33,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1)","Some teachers will be disappointed that Part IIs PBL tools do not have more of a math/science focus. Likewise, with the five PBL units in Part I, connections to specific content standards for math and science are weak. That said, this is a quality, well-written book. I recommend it. My only hesitation is with the perceived math and science focus from the books title. DIY Project Based Learning for STEM might be a more appropriate title. I believe that this would alleviate some of the expectations for strong math and science content to be the focus of the PBL units and tools.",,

40,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1)","Danielson and Marques open with their definition of performance assessments. They also discuss their importance in the classroom. They then continue to thoroughly explain the parts of the task. Throughout the book, the authors provide practical tips to assist teachers in the process and focus on collaboration. The authors are extremely detailed in their explanation and implementation strategies, which makes it easy for any reader to apply their processes. The last chapter in the book provides an abundance of tasks for teachers to use. However, ideas for differentiation are not included, and only some tasks are provided with benchmark student papers to help teachers with grading on the rubric.",,
41,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1)","Overall, this text would be beneficial for a teacher looking for alternate ways to assess their students in a meaningful way.

48,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1)",The author references the Common Core Standards for Mathematics but does not directly link tasks to particular standards. He makes no mention of prerequisite knowledge needed to complete these tasks successfully or in what grades students acquire that knowledge.,,
49,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1)","This resource is not appropriate for beginners. The tasks assume strong levels of comfort with algebraic notation and mathematical terminology that, frankly, are unrealistic expectations for students in grades 46. The tasks are overly text-heavy. Meaningful contexts for problem solving are important, but paragraphs of character back story and detail irrelevant to the mathematics are unnecessary. There is a strong correlation between reading comprehension and mathematics: If students cannot understand what the problem is describing and what the question is asking, they cannot apply mathematical strategies successfully.",,
50,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1)","This book is poorly organized as an instructional resource for teachers: Lists of supporting questions are in no particular order, explanations are presented as running dialogue, and there are no scaffolding tips provided to help struggling learners.",,
51,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1)","I would not recommend this book as an instructional resource for grades 46, even for gifted students (as the author suggests). It might be useful for students and teachers at higher grade levels (example: high school) who have had more experience in mathematics.",,

The games and puzzles provided throughout the text are intended to deepen conceptual understanding of concepts in (1) number systems; (2) ratios and proportional relationships; (3) expression and equations; (4) statistics and probability; and (5) patterns, graphs, and functions. For each game or puzzle, the authors provide tips for the classroom to support learning and understanding rather than just game play.
