"In this article, we present four  activities that build a foundation for the Pythagorean theorem and that provide experiences rich with discovery about square roots. These activities were inspired by the Connected Mathematics Project’s Looking for Pythagoras activity (Lappan et al. 1998) and address the Number and Operations and Geometry standards of Principles and Standards for School Mathematics (NCTM 2000).

Prerequisites,7,mtms2009-08-57a,,
"Before working with these activities, our students found area and slope by counting squares. They were comfortable with the connection between changes in rise and run and the length of a line segment as shown in figure 1. Students understood that going up 3 and right 2 or going right 3 and down 2 produce the same segment length. Any segment involving a combination of three and two for its rise and run has the same length.",8,mtms2009-08-57a,,
"Students also debated about the  segment with length 12 became just as real as one with length 3. Drawing a 10-square-unit diagram was not difficult. Our students tilted squares and counted areas, became frustrated and bored with counting, and looked for patterns so that their calculations would be less tedious and more precise. They made connections between the length of a square’s side and its area. They realized that 18 was the same as two 12 (i.e., 212).",9,mtms2009-08-57a,,
They talked about slopes of segments to describe their illustrations. The square root of 61 to my students meant the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs of 6 and 5. Their mathematics was visual. ,10,mtms2009-08-57a,,
"When we finally applied the  Pythagorean theorem, students thought it was a cakewalk. The Pythagorean theorem was no longer just a2 + b2 = c2. They could have easily named it the Smith theorem after  table 1 Area of tilted squares, with sides of different slope the tilt",11,mtms2009-08-57a,,

The activity still begged the question, “Isn’t there an easier way to do this?” This scenario set up the discovery of square roots.  sides oF squares are square roots “How does the length of the side of a square relate to the area of the square?” Students answered this question by looking at the nontilted  doing, they noticed patterns like those in the diagrams in fi gure 3.",25,mtms2009-08-57a,,
"Students extended this strategy  and knew they could make the squares listed in table 2. Then they might look at a square whose side has an 1-up-and-2-right length and fi nd that its area is fi ve. They doubled the pattern to obtain the squares and pattern in table 3. The fi rst time we introduced this activity, students worked on it individually. Nearly half gave up. Later, we gave the challenge to groups of three students. Working in a group encouraged them to draw on their own strengths and the strengths of their group members.

"Fig. 1 Although the order of movements is different, the resulting segment is the same length.",28,mtms2009-08-57a,,
"Fig. 2 Tilting the square provided many ways to determine length and area. The tilted square in this example has a side length of 732 + 22, or 413, and an area of 13.",29,mtms2009-08-57a,,
difference between the lengths of a horizontal or vertical unit compared with a diagonal unit. ,30,mtms2009-08-57a,,
"One Hundred Squares To begin, students were given the task found on activity sheet 1, in which they were asked to draw as many squares with areas from 1 to 100 as possible. Students found the ten most obvious squares: 1 × 1, 2 × 2, 3 × 3, . . . , 10 × 10. For some, this task took most of the hour; for others, it took a few minutes. Most students decided that they had completed the task and that there were no other squares. We said simply, “There are more.” ",31,mtms2009-08-57a,,
"As soon as students realized that they could tilt a square, they began fi nding other squares and their areas. (See fi g. 2.) We wanted our students to tilt the square and count the internal squares, then decide if the area was within the criteria. Many students literally counted the area. ",32,mtms2009-08-57a,,
"We anticipated that students would get bogged down with the tedious job of counting squares to fi nd areas and ask, “Isn’t there an easier way to do this?” Ultimately, we wanted each student to make an organized list and draw as many squares as they could on their own. (See table 1’s example of one student’s organized list.) ",33,mtms2009-08-57a,,
"Some students used a scaling method to organize the data by drawing a square as 1 up and 1 right, as 2 up and 2 right, and as 3 up and 3 right. In so  squares on activity sheet 1. If students knew the area of the square, could they find the length of the side? ",34,mtms2009-08-57a,,
"After gathering data on the non- tilted squares, students were challenged to use their calculators. They were to analyze connections between the area of a square to the length of its side. This task naturally led students to discover that the length of any side is the square root of the area. ",35,mtms2009-08-57a,,
This is the perfect place to introduce the Pythagorean theorem by using dot paper to relate what students have already completed. ,36,mtms2009-08-57a,,
"Various irrational segMent lengths Part 1 of activity sheet 2 asks students to determine the length of a given line segment drawn on dot paper.

Some students drew the right triangle, with the hypotenuse being the drawn segment. Others determined the first segment length and then saw that the second line segment is two of the first. For example, the first segment on the top left of the sheet has length 12. The segment below it is two 12 segments put  together. Students worked in all directions on this activity. Although some students may struggle, the end result is a better understanding of square roots. Students demonstrate mastery of the Pythagorean theorem and understand that the length of a side of a square is the square root of the area. ",37,mtms2009-08-57a,,

"The endpoints of the segments had to be on dots, and students had to produce the drawings. We wanted students to be able to both master the concept and be able to apply their knowledge. For example, many students know that perpendicular lines have slopes that are opposite reciprocals. However, students often cannot draw two perpendicular lines on dot paper because they do not use the rule that the two slopes are opposite reciprocals. An “a-ha” moment occurs when students can see and realize the connection between the diagram and the fact. ",54,mtms2009-08-57a,,
"When students learn that 12 refers to the length of a side of a square with area 2, ordering rational and irrational numbers is no longer a problem. Our geometry students even began to understand why  2 12 = 18.",55,mtms2009-08-57a,,
"They saw how two segments of length 12 were equal to the length of a side of a square with area 8 and that, visually, a 18 segment looked like two 12 segments. These numbers were no longer a mystery. This activity prepares students for the algebraic concept of simplifying radicals and strengthens their number sense of irrational numbers. ",56,mtms2009-08-57a,,
Final thoughts,57,mtms2009-08-57a,,
The best way to understand a concept is to start with the concrete and build to the abstract. Self-discovery leads to solid understanding. Students often struggle with slope and square roots. These activities ask students to draw squares—a basic shape. Doing so solidifies their understanding of slope and length. The activities helped students become confident in describing lines after tilting a square. ,58,mtms2009-08-57a,,
"They were given a unique connection between slope and rate of change, and how these concepts relate to parallel and perpendicular lines. Throughout the activities, students graphed and communicated their discoveries.",59,mtms2009-08-57a,,
"Irrational numbers seem to be a mystery to students. If a calculator displays  12 = 1.41421356, students want to write 1.41. However, in our classes, the issue of approximating radicals disappeared, and no calculators were necessary. Students became comfortable with and confident talking about and drawing segments whose lengths were irrational numbers. ",60,mtms2009-08-57a,,
"This set of activities is demand- ing, fun, frustrating, and invigorating. Students will walk away feeling that they have tackled something that their older friends do not understand.  ",61,mtms2009-08-57a,,
