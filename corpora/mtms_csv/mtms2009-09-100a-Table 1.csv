Learn to connect similar concepts in math and science that have different vocabulary and different meanings to provide a deeper understanding of each subject.,3,mtms2009-09-100a,,
"tThe change from students learning  all subjects together in a one-room schoolhouse to learning in classes separated by subject and grade resulted in distinct disciplines such as social studies, mathematics, science, and English. What was lost was the unified, holistic curriculum that a oneroom setting required.   Since students move from pre- kindergarten to twelfth grade, disciplines such as mathematics have become more compartmentalized as learners progress into the areas of algebra, geometry, and precalculus, for example. ",4,mtms2009-09-100a,,
"Outside of a school setting, how- ever, the lines between the disciplines of math and science tend to blur. The purpose of this article is to provide middle school mathematics teachers with a rationale and method for correlating math and science, disciplines that are natural partners, by understanding the components of both that have a reciprocal relationship. ",5,mtms2009-09-100a,,
Why Correlate,6,mtms2009-09-100a,,
"National and state standards support the coupling of math and science. Principles and Standards for School Mathematics (NCTM 2000) and  the National Science Education Standards (NRC 1996) both recommend integrating math and science. Both sets of national standards advocate for math and science connections at the program and curricular level,   including process and content. In Texas, for example, the state standards for both math and science clearly denote the inclusion of science in math and vice versa (TEA 1997).",7,mtms2009-09-100a,,
"Although recommendations to integrate math and science are definite and pronounced, a review of the literature (West, Vásquez-Mireles, and Coker 2006) indicates that there is minimal research to support the effectiveness as it relates to student performance. Only a limited number of studies ( Judson and Sawada 2000) exist that incorporate math content into a science class, whereas few studies focus on incorporating science content into a math class. More studies addressed incorporating math and science processes. These studies used a science control and did not yield statistically significant results in terms of impact on student performance. Thus, another reason to conduct correlated math and science lessons is to add to the research base.",8,mtms2009-09-100a,,
"UnderStanding the Math and SCienCe Correlation A common complaint that teachers make about lesson production is the lack of time to prepare. Researchers have surveyed teachers and conducted  studies that show that this claim is specifically true when teachers try to correlate math and science (West, Vásquez-Mireles, and Coker 2006). Other obstacles include a lack of appropriate curricular materials and difficulties with content knowledge.",9,mtms2009-09-100a,,
"A grant from the U.S. Department of Education to the mathematics department at Texas State University produced Mix It Up, which provides “intense, sustained, systemic, correlated math and science content knowledge and skills to undergraduates (preservice teachers) ",10,mtms2009-09-100a,,
"Through  correlation,  language issues   are used to  build conceptual understanding in both math and science.",11,mtms2009-09-100a,,
"and graduates (in-service teachers)” (Texas State University). The program was developed to address both math and science middle school content and provide a strategy for developing and maintaining a growing collection of field-tested correlated middle school math and science lesson plans. Approximately seventy-five correlated lessons plans have been developed since summer 2006. All mathematics content strands (number, algebra, geometry, measurement, probability, and statistics) have been investigated individually. For a more comprehensive list of lesson plans, including examples, see http://www.science.",12,mtms2009-09-100a,,

What iS Meant By “to Correlate”,14,mtms2009-09-100a,,
"Typically, the term integrate is used to denote the linking of math and science. Traditionally, this refers to math using science applications (usually in the form of word problems) and science using math as a tool. Technology has often connected the two disciplines. The term correlate is used to expand on integration to produce a true hybrid course. ",15,mtms2009-09-100a,,
"In Vásquez-Mireles and West  (2007), a mechanism for correlating was discussed. First, it was defined by noting that correlation consisted of—  1.  distinct math and science objectives, 2.  emphasis on language issues, and 3.  inclusion of parallel concepts.",16,mtms2009-09-100a,,
"Since then, a new component, called misconnections, has been identified. The remainder of this article will provide a clear definition of each of the model’s unique components as well as several examples of each. Note that many of the examples arose from class discussions centered on correlated lesson plans developed by in-service and preservice middle school mathematics teachers. ",17,mtms2009-09-100a,,

"When the word love is spoken on Valentine’s Day, it is likely to be different from the meaning conveyed on a tennis court (i.e., love means zero in tennis). Through correlation, language issues are used to build conceptual understanding in both math and science. Two routes are analyzed: 1.  Same words that have different  meanings in both math and science 2.  Different words that have the same meanings in both math and science",21,mtms2009-09-100a,,
"Same Words, Different Meanings",22,mtms2009-09-100a,,
"The words regular, average, quarter, element, density, and variance are in this first category. In science, regular objects have formulas that can be used to calculate surface area and volume, for example. In math, a regular threedimensional object is characterized by congruent polygons. A regular polygon is characterized by congruent sides and angles. Thus, a rectangular prism could be labeled regular from a scientific perspective; it would be regular in the mathematics sense only if it were a cube. ",23,mtms2009-09-100a,,
"Scientists use average speed to  denote the ratio of the total distance traveled and total time traveled. This  calculation can differ significantly if interval speeds are averaged using the mean. A Little Red Riding Hood scenario expands on the point. See figure 1. The average speed of Little Red Riding Hood’s travel from home, to the grocery store, to her boyfriend’s house, and to grandma’s house is 2.4 km/hr. However, the statistical average of speeds is 2.5 km/hr. The word average is used similarly in other scientific definitions, such as when referring to temperature. The statistical average of speeds does not take into account the duration at each speed, whereas the average speed does (see fig. 2). ",24,mtms2009-09-100a,,
"In space science, a quarter moon denotes the phase in which half a circle is visible from Earth. Half of the moon is illuminated, but only half of the illuminated half is visible from Earth. Thus, one quarter of the surface of the moon is visibly lit, rather than one quarter of the visible portion illuminated, as one may expect as implied by the phase’s name. ",25,mtms2009-09-100a,,
The element of a set in mathematics differs significantly from elements on the periodic table. Scientists may describe elements as being dense. Saying that a real number is dense does not mean that we calculate the ratio of its mass to its  (a),26,mtms2009-09-100a,,
Statistical average speed (b),27,mtms2009-09-100a,,
"Average speed volume, as in physics. In fact, it does not make sense to do this type of calculation, since real numbers do not have these characteristics. However, the idea of compactness expresses this notion (see the “Parallel Concepts” section). Another example is the term vari- ance. In statistics, variance is a calculation indicating spread. In the life sciences, a difference or deviation in structure or character from others of the same species or group is known as variance. ",28,mtms2009-09-100a,,
"Different Words, Same Meanings",29,mtms2009-09-100a,,
"Word pairs that may fit this different words-same meanings designation include displacement and distance and various terms related to symmetry. Displacement in physics is defined as an object’s overall change in position; it is a vector quantity. The distance formula is used to calculate the value  of displacement. See figure 3 and revisit Little Red Riding Hood’s travels. Suppose she leaves home, walks to the library to return books, then walks to grandma’s house. The total distance traveled is 7 km, the distance from her home to grandma’s house is 5 km, and the displacement is 5 km northeast. ",30,mtms2009-09-100a,,
Consider the concept of symmetry. ,31,mtms2009-09-100a,,
"In life sciences, typical references to two types of symmetry include bilateral and radial symmetry. See figure 4. Plants that can be divided into halves that are approximately mirror images of each other have bilateral symmetry. In mathematics, it ",32,mtms2009-09-100a,,
"Fig. 3 The distance from Little Red Riding Hood’s home to her grandma’s house, in mathematical terms, is defined as her displacement, in the context of science. Using the same definition for each, the value is 5 km.",33,mtms2009-09-100a,,
"is referred to as reflection symmetry. Examples of this type of symmetry include leaves, humans, and isosceles triangles. Radial symmetry and rotational symmetry have the same meaning. With radial symmetry, the same parts occur regularly about a centrally located axis. This is consistent with the definition of rotational symmetry in mathematics. Apples cut horizontally and equilateral triangles have radial, or rotational, symmetry. ",34,mtms2009-09-100a,,
"Other language issues can arise  through correlated math and science lessons when conceptual understanding is incomplete. Examples include— 1.  weight and mass (students believe these terms are interchangeable), 2.  distance and absolute value (students believe that these ideas are not related), and  3.  vertical angles (students believe that vertical means up and down and thus do not relate this concept to the vertex). ",35,mtms2009-09-100a,,
"Another issue actually permeates the English language, in general. Homonyms are words that sound the same but are spelled differently and have different meanings, such as hole and whole, quarts and quartz, and sign and sine. ",36,mtms2009-09-100a,,
"Mathematical notation can also  look the same. Consider (2, 3). Is this ",37,mtms2009-09-100a,,
"Fig. 4 Forms of symmetry are described with different terminology in science and math. The leaf is an example of bilateral symmetry (science), which is equivalent to reflection symmetry (math). The flower exhibits radial symmetry (science), which is equivalent to rotational symmetry (math).",38,mtms2009-09-100a,,
"an ordered pair or an interval? There are also words that have a variety of meanings in different contexts such as displacement, symmetry, and integrate.

A nonintegrated approach to the concept of exponents would typically include simply defining them. ,42,mtms2009-09-100a,,

"A correlated strategy elaborates on the biological idea of mitosis. The concept of mitosis is also referred to as cell division. In this context, the word division is not implying the mathematical  operation or idea of cutting into parts. The cell is actually duplicated, which occurs exponentially. See figure 5.

Parallel concePts,48,mtms2009-09-100a,,
"Concepts in math and science that have the same conceptual framework are parallel. Some parallel concepts refer to the same terms. The word alternate is used in plant anatomy (alternate leaf arrangements); in math, alternate interior angles are found. Math constants such as p, j, and e and the constant of integration, C, denote consistency, as do constants in the scientific method. Both the solar system and the real number system also parallel each other in that both refer to a set of objects that form an integrated whole. ",49,mtms2009-09-100a,,
"Density of real numbers parallels the general physics idea of density in the notion of compactness. Furthermore, the idea of equations in both chemistry and algebra parallel each other. Additionally, both science and math refer to the idea of homogeneous and heterogeneous. ",50,mtms2009-09-100a,,
"Other parallel concepts require a broad knowledge base of both math and science:  •  Equations and chemical equilibrium balancing •  Protons, electrons, and neutrons  and positive and negative numbers •  Cardinal points (north, south, east,  and west) and quadrants in the rectangular coordinate plane  •  Acceleration and slope of a line as they relate to the difference between the number “zero” and the idea of “no”  •  Universal quantification (for all) regarding mass and decimal notation (everything has a mass and all real numbers can be written in decimal form)  •  Newton’s third law of motion (for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction) and the defini-",51,mtms2009-09-100a,,

An Example of Parallel Concepts,55,mtms2009-09-100a,,
Both math and science have many examples of the term center. A non- integrated approach involving centers of triangles can focus on these definitions: epicenter 1.  An orthocenter is the point of intersection of three altitudes.,56,mtms2009-09-100a,,
2.  A centroid is the point of intersection of three medians.,57,mtms2009-09-100a,,
3.  The incenter is the point of intersection of three angle bisectors.,58,mtms2009-09-100a,,
"More emphasis is generally placed on understanding, finding, or drawing the altitudes, medians, and angle bisectors.",59,mtms2009-09-100a,,
"Expand on the nonintegrated lesson by including science examples in which the center is used, which will  yield a more integrated approach. For example, city engineers use this idea when determining an optimal location for a park in relation to three areas of town. Center is important when discussing earthquakes. A correlated lesson may include a discussion of the epicenter, which is the part of the earth’s surface that is the focus of the earthquake. A connection to prefixes can also be made: epi (on), ortho (around), and in (in). The process of finding the epicenter parallels the idea of finding three triangular centers; for example, the point where three circles intersect relative to three seismographs produces the epicenter of an earthquake. (See fig. 6.)",60,mtms2009-09-100a,,
Misconnections,61,mtms2009-09-100a,,
"Concepts in one discipline can occur in a contradictory fashion in another discipline, which produce miscon- nections. Contradictions can occur within the same discipline. For example, the wrong way to add two fractions such as 1/3 + 4/5 is to add the numerators (1 + 4) and the denominators (3 + 5) to form the new numerator and denominator, (1 + 4)/ (3 + 5), or 5/8. However, when working within the context of statistics,  8 23 epicenter",62,mtms2009-09-100a,,

"Fig. 7 examples of misconnections can involve parts of a circle and dispersed sand. One-fourth of the circle is shaded, and one-fourth of the soil sample is sand.",64,mtms2009-09-100a,,
epicenter 5/8 would be correct when finding the combined proportion. Consider this chemical equation:,65,mtms2009-09-100a,,
Carbon dioxide reacts with hydrogen to produce methane and water: CO2 + 4H2 → CH4 + 2H2O,66,mtms2009-09-100a,,
"This equation is considered balanced, although there is no mention of an equal sign. Instead, the use of a right arrow (→) relates the two sides, because the left-hand side implies that the right-hand side and direction are important. It is balanced because the same number of each element exists on both sides. The use of arrows set in this way means equilibrium. In this example, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, methane, and water would all exist at the same time if equilibrium was achieved. The use of subscripts to denote quantities of elements is comparable to the use of coefficients in mathematics. Coefficients are used in chemistry to denote the number of chemical compounds. Compounds are written by placing the element’s symbols side by side; mixed  numbers are also written side by side. In both cases, addition is implied, as opposed to multiplication, as is the case in mathematics. ",67,mtms2009-09-100a,,
"Fraction representations are typically misconnected. In math, on the one hand, distinct parts of a whole are represented as being connected, as illustrated in figure 7’s pie graph. Typical science examples, on the other hand, represent parts as being dispersed among the whole, as shown with the sand example in figure 7. ",68,mtms2009-09-100a,,
An Example of a Misconnection,69,mtms2009-09-100a,,
"In middle school, students begin to explore linear relationships. A question such as, “You buy 10 pieces of candy and each piece costs $0.20. What was the total cost?” can be viewed as a multiplication problem and used as a springboard to demonstrate a linear relationship.",70,mtms2009-09-100a,,
An integrated math-science approach could use a problem based on the linear relationship between temperature and crickets chirping.,71,mtms2009-09-100a,,
"A correlated lesson could explore the connection among y = x, y = mx,  y = x + b, and y = mx + b.  The examples are listed here algebraically, although in reality, the explorations would be more concrete. A graphical  representation can shed more light on these relationships. Referring to y = x as the parent equation (and later function) and the group of equations as a family foreshadows the idea that this phenomenon may be true for other equations (or functions). This idea is contradicted in science, however, when discussing parent isotopes. A parent isotope has the potential to change to a daughter isotope over time. That is, parts of an element morph into different elements. In mathematics, the parent equation is not altered, yet different equations are related to it.  sUMMarY",72,mtms2009-09-100a,,
"Although many recommendations have been made to integrate math and science, it is easier said than done. Correlating math and science provides a way for both math and science teachers to accomplish this goal. In particular, identifying specific components of language issues, parallel concepts, and misconnections can spark  creative lessons that achieve equity in addressing both math and science curricular objectives. Correlated lessons align with national, state, and local standards and naturally incorporate the best practices of both disciplines. ",73,mtms2009-09-100a,,
