"Introduce students to matrices while they encode, decode, and pass secret messages in math class. ",3,mtms2012-11-212a,,
"Learning mathematics is challenging. It requires discipline, logic, precision, perseverance, and accuracy. It can also be fun. When mathematics is set in a context that inspires students to want to solve interesting problems, students will have an intrinsic desire to learn the necessary skills to accomplish a specifi c goal. The game of Crypto! was designed to introduce middle school students to matrices in the context of decrypting a secret message. In so doing, the concepts of  a matrix, rows, elements, equivalent matrices, inverse matrices, identity matrices, matrix multiplication, and solving matrix equations will be touched on. The game can be played with or without a graphing calculator, depending on the learning goals. It should be explored after students have a basic understanding of algebra.",4,mtms2012-11-212a,,
set up For crypto!,5,mtms2012-11-212a,,
"Students work with a partner. To begin play, each student devises a  secret message that he or she will encode and a partner will decode. The partners also agree on a key that they will share to encode and decode the message. The students need to convert the letters in their message into numbers and will use matrices to encode and decode the message. Each letter of the alphabet is assigned a number, with A being 1 and Z being 26. A period, comma, question mark, exclamation mark, and space are also assigned numbers. ",6,mtms2012-11-212a,,

"My students use color keys from  four uniquely colored golf tees. I made wooden blocks with holes for the golf tees to help students remember both the placement and the color. To keep track of the colored tees, I assigned each one a number on the basis of how many letters are in the name of the color. However, this step is unnecessary when playing the game because the key can simply be numerical and written on paper instead.  setting the stage",8,mtms2012-11-212a,,
"To introduce the activity and elicit interest in its completion, I give students some background information on cryptography with the following scenario:  The National Security Administration (NSA) needs to get a message to an undercover operative working on a top-secret operation vital to the nation’s security. The NSA has recruited you, a middle  school student, with a working knowledge of algebra to help with the transfer of information. They have given you the 2 × 2 code key in which to encipher the message and have told you the secret message. Your mission is to correctly encipher the message that only you know and pass it on to the undercover operative. Once the message is received, the undercover operative will decipher it and protect our country’s national security.",9,mtms2012-11-212a,,

"The first time that the game is played, activity sheet 1 is given to each student. The students follow the steps on the first page and fill in their matrices. Then they use the key and the message matrix along with matrix multiplication to encode the message. Encoded messages are then exchanged between partners. ",13,mtms2012-11-212a,,
"After receiving the encoded mes- sage, students must then decode their partner’s message using the key’s inverse matrix. Next, they will need to convert the numerical message back  to letters using the chart shown in figure 1. The steps for decoding are on activity sheet 2. This sheet gives students the opportunity to decode a secret message before they are familiar with the process. After a few rounds with the process, and as the  students become more familiar with encoding and decoding the messages, they should no longer need the structure provided by the printed activity sheet. ",14,mtms2012-11-212a,,
"At times, students may get lost  in the encoding or decoding process. Therefore, I display a flow-chart visual (see fig. 2) on the overhead projector while students work through their message. If they get lost, I refer them to the chart. As with activity sheet 2, after a few rounds the students no longer need to refer to it. ",15,mtms2012-11-212a,,
"When students are deciphering their partner’s message, they often mistakenly use the 2 × 2 key instead of the inverse of the 2 × 2 key. They type [A][C] instead of [A]-1[C] into the calculator. The result is a matrix with large numbers that cannot be decoded. If this occurs and the student asks for assistance, use this  teachable moment to remind the student how the use of the inverse matrix in solving matrix equations is similar to the use of the reciprocal in solving algebraic equations with fractions. If the student did not use the reciprocal when solving an algebraic equation with fractions, the answer would also be incorrect.",16,mtms2012-11-212a,,
"Depending on the learning goals  of the instructor and the mathematics level of the students, this game can be easily adapted for use with a graphing calculator. Once the coded messages are converted into numbers, students can use the matrix function of the calculator to input matrices, multiply matrices, and identify the inverse matrix. If working with matrix multiplication and finding inverse matrices are skills that the teacher wants the students to master, this game provides the repetition necessary for student ",17,mtms2012-11-212a,,

alignment with common  core state standards,40,mtms2012-11-212a,,
Crypto! was developed with the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSM) and its Mathematical Practices in mind (CCSSI 2010a). ,41,mtms2012-11-212a,,
"By introducing matrices in middle school, students will have experienced  them when they occur in high school. In the high school Common Core  Number and Quantity area, one domain, Vector and Matrix Quantities,  contains six standards, N-VM.6. to N-VM.11. Using matrices to represent  and manipulate data and multiplying matrices by scalars to produce new  matrices are just two areas discussed.",42,mtms2012-11-212a,,
"The strand N-VM.9 states that students should “understand that, unlike multiplication of numbers, matrix multiplication for square matrices is not a commutative operation” (CCSSI 2010a, p. 61). The CCSSM Introduction states, “the middle school and high school standards call on students to  practice applying mathematical ways of thinking to real world issues and  challenges; they prepare students to think and reason mathematically”  (CCSSI 2010b). Crypto! allows students the opportunity to do just that. ",43,mtms2012-11-212a,,
"CCSSM also states, “the Standards set a rigorous definition of college  and career readiness, not by piling topic upon topic, but by demanding that students develop a depth of understanding and ability to apply mathematics to novel situations, as college students and employees regularly do.” Crypto! allows students to apply mathematics to a situation that is unique to the  players and novel every time it is played.",44,mtms2012-11-212a,,
The Mathematical Practices in CCSSM are prevalent throughout this game. ,45,mtms2012-11-212a,,
"The use of Crypto! as an interactive, instructional tool allows students the opportunity to make sense of problems and persevere in solving them. The problems are student-created, student-solved, and student-checked for  correctness. To understand how the game is played using matrices, the student must reason abstractly and quantitatively. To develop a matrix that accurately reflects the message and encode the matrix to send the message to another,  the student is being asked to model with math and be precise so that the receiver can accurately decipher the original message. As Crypto! is used throughout the matrix unit, the student will be given the opportunity to look for and express regularity in repeated reasoning.  encouraging curiosity",46,mtms2012-11-212a,,
"At the end of the activity, I often hear, “That was fun!” or “I want to do that again.” Once I have gone through the activity with the entire class, most students can play independently with little or no assistance from the teacher. This makes a perfect activity for those unexpected days when students finish their assignments early or an unplanned school activity disrupts the normal class schedule. ",47,mtms2012-11-212a,,
"I encourage students who are interested in cryptography to try their hand at actual cryptanalysis  by going to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) website: http:// www.fbi.gov/news/stories/2009/ december/code_122409 where they can find the online activity “Can You Crack a Code?” Students can also be directed to books such as Codes, Ciphers and Secret Writing by Martin Gardner (1972). The teacher might wish to highlight or discuss scenes from the 2001 movie Enigma about the German cipher machine used during World War Two. However, the movie’s R rating should preclude student access. ",48,mtms2012-11-212a,,
Why play gaMes?,49,mtms2012-11-212a,,
"Playing games in the classroom has been shown to be a successful strategy for teaching mathematics when used as a teaching tool. “A game is an activity performed under strict rules in which players seek to participate because it is fun and challenging” (Falco 2001). A good game for a mathematics classroom should give students the opportunity to observe patterns and use their logical reasoning to find a solution to a unique situation. The structure of a good game requires the player to perform the specific thinking skills determined by the teacher; the fun of the game results in students engaging in the repeated play that is necessary to master the skills. As a student masters the basic skills necessary for the game, the focus of the activity shifts from basic skills to higher-order thinking skills, which are necessary to develop specific strategies to find the solution quickly and efficiently.",50,mtms2012-11-212a,,
"Because classroom games are often  played in teams or with partners, a social benefit is gained from teaching this structured activity in the classroom. Games such as Crypto! that require students to interact and communicate with one another to solve a problem help build students’ social relationship skills. Unlike sports, where players are often adversaries, Crypto! does not promote an adversarial relationship among the players. Both players can be equally successful; in fact, the success of one player can lead to the success of the other. The fun of playing a challenging game can reduce the pressures that lead to conflict, thus helping to build positive social relationship skills that students will find necessary later in the workplace.  gaMes: a valuable tool",51,mtms2012-11-212a,,
"Because this activity is student- centered, it allows the teacher to  focus on the students’ mathematical  processes while they are engaged in the game. This activity allows students to become engaged in their own learning processes and the learning processes of other participants. If the message is not decoded correctly, partners must work together to find the mistake and correct it. Learning mathematics is challenging, but so can be the teaching of mathematics. The challenge for the teacher is to find and use tools that motivate students to persevere and master the skills that are being introduced. Games used as instructional activities, such as Crypto! may be one tool in a teacher’s toolbox that accomplishes this goal.",52,mtms2012-11-212a,,
