32,Going Yard with Meters - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"3.Sample solution: The area of the bedroom is 14 ft. • 8.5 ft. = 119 ft.2. There are 9 ft.2 in 1 yd.2, so the area of the bedroom is 119 ÷ 9, or about 13.2 yd.2. Because the carpeting is sold in full square yards, the carpeting will cost 14 • $23.76 = $332.64.",,

41,Going Yard with Meters - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Editor’s note: In baseball, “going yard” is an expression often used when a batter hits a home run. The title of this Cartoon Corner is meant to  suggest that you are hitting a “home run” when you use meters or the  metric system, in general.",,
42,Going Yard with Meters - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,FIELD-TEST COMMENTS,,
43,Going Yard with Meters - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I reviewed this cartoon activity with my sixth-grade classes. It just so happened that several of my students played in flag football leagues in the community, so they laughed when they saw the yard instructions! These students were also very helpful when it came to explaining a bit of the game of football to some students who did not know much about it.",,
44,Going Yard with Meters - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The most significant part of this activity for my students was the conversations prompted by question 4.  The majority of my students were foreign born or have parents who were foreign born, so learning “rules of thumb” to compare metric and customary units of measure was exactly what some of them needed. Students talked about liters and gallons and asked why we purchase gallons of milk and liters of soda. One student also inquired as to why her doctor measures her weight in kilograms and not in pounds. A student born in Brazil and newly arrived in America was interested in knowing how to measure in inches if there are “not 10 little lines in between.” “Centimeters are so much easier!” she explained to the class.",,
45,Going Yard with Meters - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"As an extension, we spoke about other units of measure (like fathoms and stadia, which were used in ancient times) and new ones created because of advances in technology (like bytes, megabytes, and so on).",,

49,Going Yard with Meters - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Using the information that Jason provided in the cartoon, my sixth-grade prealgebra students tackled the conversions between meters and yards. They felt that Jason’s calculations were as close as you could get when converting between the two systems.",,
50,Going Yard with Meters - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We spent quite a bit of time talking about the units of measure. Which  is longer, 1 kilometer or 1 mile? If  1 kilometer is approximately 0.62 mile, which unit would you need to have more of to cover the same distance? The conversation took many twists and turns as the conversion rates were reviewed in question 4.",,
51,Going Yard with Meters - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"After spending time converting between the two systems, students thought that carpeting a bedroom would be an easy calculation until they realized that more conversions were needed. Overall, this mathematical discourse occurring as it did during the first week of school provided me quite a bit of insight into the conceptual understanding of my new students.",,

55,Going Yard with Meters - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I gave this activity to my eighth graders in the third week of school. They really enjoyed the comic, and it timed well with the season of the year, especially since several of them were playing football. Students were eager to start and really liked using their reference sheets (a tool we recently developed in class) to find information and use the conversions.",,
56,Going Yard with Meters - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Students enjoyed debating the use of the rules of thumb in question 4 and even used some of the information from the comic to help. For the question about yards to meters, one pair of students used the relationship between yards and meters from the comic (about 10.936133 yards is equivalent to 10 meters) to select the relationship that 1 yard is approximately 1 meter.",,
57,Going Yard with Meters - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,We ended up sharing our strategies to approach the problem about the cost of the carpet to decide if it was simpler to convert to yards before or after finding the area. We looked at visual displays of square yards and had a rich discussion about the square- cube law from there.,,

61,Going Yard with Meters - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,I used this Cartoon Corner as an in-class activity with eighth-grade students during the first month of school. We had not previously discussed unit conversion or the metric system in class. Students favored estimation and reasoning about possible answer choices over numerical calculations for the conversions in question 2.,,
62,Going Yard with Meters - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In question 3, many students misinterpreted the last piece of information given in the problem to mean that they must round the length and width of the room to the nearest whole yard before calculating area. Student engagement was highest during question 4, and they were particularly enthusiastic about  using their thumbnail to estimate  1 centimeter.",,
63,Going Yard with Meters - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Many students struggled with the logic behind question 5, but most students actively engaged in discussion about the statements. Examining a 12-inch ruler helped students visualize the relationship between feet and inches and to assess the accuracy of each statement.",,
