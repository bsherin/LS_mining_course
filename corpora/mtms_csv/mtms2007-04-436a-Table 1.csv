Finally, take a fourth left quarter turn and go six units to the right. note that in the process of following these directions, a 360-degree-counterclockwise turn has been taken. also notice that you have moved right (r), up (u), left  (l),  down  (d),  and  back  to  right  (r),  in  that order. after you have completed one set of numbers, mark your location with an enlarged dot so ",1,mtms2007-04-436a,,
A ll students can succeed in creat-  ing mathematical art. this article offers some ideas about creating mathematical art based on number patterns. it includes a process that integrates number and geometry and results  in  attractive  and  useful  patterned  squares. students  may  perform  the  activity  with  paper  and pencil  or  use  computer  software  like  the  Geometer’s sketchpad. the diagrams in this article were completed  using  sketchpad.  the  article  also  features  the  use  of  conjecturing  as  an  important  element in mathematics instruction.,2,mtms2007-04-436a,,
"there are many uses of square patterns around us.  some  are  simply  functional;  others  are  more elaborate  and  artistically  crafted.  For  example, floors  and  patios  are  routinely  covered  with  patterned square tiles. Quilts are frequently composed of  varied  patterned  squares.  square  tiles  are  also used to decorate trays, tabletops, book jackets, and borders.  colorful  square  designs  often  appear  on various  types  of  clothing.  such  patterns  were  designed  based  on  the  imagination  and  creativity  of the artist. However, similar patterned squares can be constructed using five positive integers and a few geometric instructions. these patterns can easily be produced on square grid or square dot paper.",3,mtms2007-04-436a,,

"Using Five Numbers to Make Patterned Squares two  distinct  projects  can  be  undertaken  using patterned squares. the class can (1) collaborate on a  project  that  finds  what sequences of five numbers will  produce  a  patterned square  and  can  develop a  set  of  conjectures  to  go along  with  their  findings, and (2) be given sequences  of  five  numbers  that yield  patterned  squares. they can use the squares in a variety of ways as a combined mathematics and art project.

You will return to S after going through the sequence of five numbers four times. observe that the design in figure 1 is symmetrical; it has four-fold rotational symmetry. the design from the sequence 2, 1, 3, 5, 6 is not a patterned square. on the other hand, when the chosen sequence is 2, 5, 2, 6, 7, a patterned square design results.

While creating  and  justifying  conjectures,  students  link the concrete with the abstract and develop skill in making  generalizations. “conjecture—that  is,  informed  guessing—is  a major  pathway  to  discovery. to make conjectures, students  need  multiple opportunities  and  rich, engaging  contexts for learning”  (nctM  2000, p.  57).  the  topic  of  patterned squares is rich in potential conjectures.

"Conjecture  1.  any  set  of  five  positive  numbers will  always  return  to  the  starting  point  S.  Here  is a convincing argument for this conjecture. let S = 0. Make a mark on moves to the right or up as +; mark moves to the left or down as –. this implies that five sets of +, +, –, – will be used as the complete path is written. suppose the given sequence of five numbers is a, b, c, d, e. the four repetitions of the sequence yield the expression + a + b – c – d + e + a – b – c  + d + e – a – b + c + d – e – a + b + c – d – e the  expression  simplifies  to  0.  this  indicates  that the path ends at S.

Point out how useful algebraic expressions can be in stating a conjecture or in reaching a conclusion.) ",19,mtms2007-04-436a,,
"Conjecture  2.  if  all  five  numbers  are  the  same, say a, a, a, a, a, then as expected, one square with side length a units is formed. When the repetition of the five-number sequence is carried out four times, each  enlarged  dot  that  marks  a  completion  of  the sequence becomes a vertex of the square.",20,mtms2007-04-436a,,
"Conjecture 3. if four numbers in the five-number sequence are the same, say 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, then all orderings of the five numbers—3, 3, 3, 3, 1; 3, 3, 3, 1, 3;  3, 3, 1, 3, 3; 3, 1, 3, 3, 3; and 1, 3, 3, 3, 3—produce the same patterned square. see figure 3(a). the result is  always  a  patterned  square,  whether  the  number that appears once is smaller or larger than the number that appears four times. in fact, in the sequence a, a, a, a, b, if a > b, then the patterned square has side length 2a – b units, as in figure 3(a), whereas if a < b, the side length is simply b units. see figure 3(b).

What may be different in each design is the location of the four enlarged dots that mark the end of each sequence of five numbers as  the  path  is  sketched  from  beginning  to  end.  see figure 4 and note the five different sets of four samecolored dots. depending on repetitions of numbers in a sequence, some cycles may have the same set of four same-colored dots. another related conjecture here is that the four dots are the vertices of a square.  the dot color’s corresponding ordered sequence is  blue—12345; red—23451;  green—34512; white—45123; and black—51234.",22,mtms2007-04-436a,,

His work stimulated many activities that could be carried out using paper-and-pencil explorations. in the 1980s, when  the  logo  list-processing  computer  language became popular, renewed interest in spirolaterals occurred, and more extensive investigations were undertaken. logo graphics procedures made it easy to construct the designs and investigate the outcomes from numerous number sequences in combination with a broad selection of turning angles.",29,mtms2007-04-436a,,
