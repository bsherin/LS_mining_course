11,Getting Mileage out of Your 401(K),"SOLUTIONS 1.  a.  A 401(k) is a retirement plan  whereby workers save money (as contributions) in an account for retirement. Generally, the employee pays no taxes on the contributions or on the income derived on the money until the money is withdrawn later in life. Many employers partially or fully match the contributions made by the employees. It is called a “401(k)” because the plan is defined in subsection 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code.",11,Getting Mileage out of Your 401(K)
12,Getting Mileage out of Your 401(K),"you contribute 6%, the employer matches with another 6%. So your account will have a 12% contribution: 0.12 × $40,000.00 = $4,800.00. When you contribute 8%, your employer still contributes 6%. So your account will have a 14% contribution:  0.14 × $40,000.00 = $5,600.00.",12,Getting Mileage out of Your 401(K)
13,Getting Mileage out of Your 401(K),"b.  $3,600.00. When you contribute  6%, the employer contributes  50% of 6%, or 3%. So your acount will have a 9% contribution: 0.09 × $40,000.00 = $3,600.00.",13,Getting Mileage out of Your 401(K)
14,Getting Mileage out of Your 401(K),b.  Sample solution: 401K could also  be viewed as a “race” that is  401 kilometers (401K) long (as in a 10K race).  c.  1 km ≈ 0.621 mi.; 401 km ≈  249.021 mi. The number of miles was rounded to 250.,14,Getting Mileage out of Your 401(K)

16,Getting Mileage out of Your 401(K),"4.  Answers will vary. It is a good idea to participate in a plan in which the employer makes a contribution because essentially the employer is giving you “free money.” It would be difficult to earn the “rate of return” the employer is providing anywhere else.  5.

23,Getting Mileage out of Your 401(K),I used this cartoon with my level 1 adult education math class. We had studied percentages fairly extensively before our Christmas break. I presented this activity as a review when they came back in January. ,23,Getting Mileage out of Your 401(K)
24,Getting Mileage out of Your 401(K),The majority of my students are ,24,Getting Mileage out of Your 401(K)
25,Getting Mileage out of Your 401(K),"English language learners, so I needed to make a few modifications. Since cartoons can be very challenging for my students, we did question 1 together. After projecting the cartoon on the board, we held a classroom discussion about what it meant. I do have a few native speakers who were able to share what they knew about a 401K account. Noting that the  250 miles was a distance measurement, I then asked whether anyone could think of a distance measurement that the K might stand for. ",25,Getting Mileage out of Your 401(K)
26,Getting Mileage out of Your 401(K),"Students worked independently or  in pairs on the remaining questions. The common error that students made with questions 2b and 2c was that they just wanted to multiply the interest from 2a by the number of years. We discussed the fact that we had a new balance after year 1, and they were able to take it from there. I modified the assignment by requiring only questions 1 through 4 be answered. Question 5 was a challenge for more advanced students. ",26,Getting Mileage out of Your 401(K)
27,Getting Mileage out of Your 401(K),"Although my students found this activity challenging, the majority were successful. A lot of class discussion and scaffolding occurred in the form of questions. I like the fact that the cartoon also introduced many students to new vocabulary.

31,Getting Mileage out of Your 401(K),"My sixth-grade prealgebra students recognized the humor without understanding a 401K! They knew that the cartoon involved an investment opportunity, but they had little background knowledge. Students were amazed that employers would contribute and definitely saw the benefits of (as they put it) free money! ",31,Getting Mileage out of Your 401(K)
32,Getting Mileage out of Your 401(K),"Students worked with a partner to  calculate interest, see it compound, and compute the balance in an account from year 1 through year 5. As a class, we discussed what happened as students continued to find each successive year’s balance: $1,000.00 (1.02) and that answer multiplied by 1.02 and that answer by 1.02, eventually realizing that that they could multiply the $1,000.00 by 1.02 to the power of the number of years.
