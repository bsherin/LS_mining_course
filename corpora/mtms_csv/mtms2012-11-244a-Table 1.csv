"The phenomenon of online learning is rapidly becoming a common element in education. Although many districts are pushing for online implementation, not all teachers are prepared to use this technology in a mathematics classroom. The tips presented here can help a teacher turn a classroom from a technological wasteland into a rich technological oasis.",4,mtms2012-11-244a,,
"Online learning has become a trend within colleges and universities (Bejerano 2008; Harasim 2000; Lorenzetti 2008), and has entered high schools, as well (Young, Birtolo, and McElman 2009). Online learning appears in several forms, but Internet resources and interactive communication are common digital requirements. Unfortunately, few documented middle school models of extensive technology use are available. As a seventh-year middle school teacher in pursuit of my doctoral degree, I have experienced online learning extensively as a college student and as a teacher conducting dissertation research in this area. What follows are suggestions for transitioning from a traditional middle school classroom to one that incorporates online learning.",5,mtms2012-11-244a,,
"Over the past four years, our  school has expanded its technology  resources, giving every student a laptop. Through grant funding, I have been able to procure multiple iPads® and graphics tablets for classroom use. Technology is used in my math class every day, often for entire class periods. Throughout this process, I have developed my own mathematics units that are entirely online. ",6,mtms2012-11-244a,,
"This change to using laptops or iPads for lessons or units does not happen overnight. A few common classroom practices can be converted to digital procedures, and typical pitfalls can be avoided when using technology with students. ",7,mtms2012-11-244a,,
"Each category discussed in the next  section meshes to create an exclusive online experience. If you are hoping to ease into this process, each section can stand alone or be integrated with your current curriculum. These different classroom ideas are compatible with any laptop and can be used on an iPad either through the preinstalled Web browser or by downloading the app for the program (available iPad apps are listed in table 1).  classrooM Practice",8,mtms2012-11-244a,,

"Provides a way for students to  subscribe to different mathematicsrelated accounts to receive instruction, help, problems, a look into math  careers, and many other options.  Teachers can use this tool to share classroom ideas with one another. Provides videos that can be searched on a variety of math-related topics.  videos can serve the same purpose. Sites such as YouTube (www.youtube .com), TeacherTube (www.teacher tube.com), and Khan Academy (www .khanacademy.org) contain many videos that offer students a different view. Whether your preferred teaching approach is lecture, inquiry, problem based, or some other instructional strategy, videos are available to match your preference. They can be used in multiple ways, including as stand alones or as supplemental tools to support differentiated instruction and to allow individual students to focus on different concepts.",76,mtms2012-11-244a,,
"One of the best ways I have found to use videos is to ask the students to view them individually on their laptops, using earphones, while I am walking  around answering questions and explaining concepts to those having difficulties. This approach frees the teacher to give attention to students who need help, and allows others to advance at their own pace. This process works especially well in a mathematics classroom because most concepts can be sequenced to build on one another. ",77,mtms2012-11-244a,,
"I have also asked students to watch videos at home to preview or reinforce instruction. In fact, a whole classroom can be flipped, meaning that students are responsible for all their instruction outside of school hours so that the full class period can be devoted to the activity or project that accompanies instruction. For a further rationale for a flipped classroom, visit http://www .knewton.com/flipped-classroom.",78,mtms2012-11-244a,,
"Cost-Effective Virtual Manipulatives Manipulatives such as base ten blocks, fraction rods, and algebra tiles can also be used to further a student’s understanding through concrete representation.

"Although many districts are pushing for online implementation,  not all teachers  are prepared to use this technology  in math class.  students. However, computer access brings many Internet websites devoted solely to online manipulatives. The National Library of Virtual Manipulatives (nlvm.usu.edu) contains handson tools to aid instruction. NCTM’s Illuminations (illuminations.nctm.org) site will also accomplish this goal. Almost any type of manipulative can be found online, addressing a variety of concepts at no cost. ",80,mtms2012-11-244a,,
Communication Options,81,mtms2012-11-244a,,
"Communication is a necessary skill for demonstrating mathematical understanding and sharing ideas to facilitate proficiency. Of the many options available for online interaction, Google Talk (www.google.com/talk) is one that works well. Each student has a Gmail (mail.google.com) account, which makes setting up communication hubs easy. During our completely digital units, I field questions and comments through the chat function. Students can also initiate one-on-one communications with other students. I occasionally ask students to post summaries of their understandings of a particular concept on Twitter (www .twitter.com). Students can also view their classmates’ posts using Tweet-",82,mtms2012-11-244a,,
"Deck (www.tweetdeck.com) and Blogger (www.blogger.com). Each of these communication methods can be monitored using observational software (discussed later) or by following your student’s Twitter or Blogger accounts. Be sure to talk with your students about school policies, as well as your own expectations and educational goals for these forms of communication. ",83,mtms2012-11-244a,,
Production and Assessment,84,mtms2012-11-244a,,
"Various assessments and assignments that have traditionally been completed on paper can now be accomplished digitally. Technology opens up new possibilities for products that allow students to demonstrate understanding of mathematical concepts. IXL Math (www.ixl.com) is a licensed site that offers numerous practice problems and rich explanations to help students enhance their mathematical proficiency. It also allows teachers to monitor their students’ progress. Every math concept indexed to state standards is available for practice; when combined with videos, students can accelerate beyond typical expectations. ",85,mtms2012-11-244a,,
"Producing a narrated video with  iMovie (www.apple.com/ilife/imovie) or a podcast using GarageBand (www .apple.com/ilife/garageband) can increase a student’s mathematical understanding through creative uses of projects, such as a student-produced weekly math talk show. Geometry projects come to life through the use of free downloadable software like GeoGebra (www.geogebra.org) and Google SketchUp (sketchup.google .com). I used these two programs on an Internet-connected laptop and turned a mundane exploration of rectangular prism surface area into a cereal box competition, complete with digital drawings, marketing concepts, and customer feedback. My previous approach to teaching this concept did not involve a real-world application  or a digital component to enhance learning. I found that the cereal box competition was an effective motivational tool.",86,mtms2012-11-244a,,

Teachers New to Technology,88,mtms2012-11-244a,,
"We want our students to be independent and responsible for their own learning. We try to facilitate student success by providing helpful resources. The same situation applies to teachers using technology. If you struggle with technology, find resources, such as coworkers, friends, or even students, who can aid your learning process. Do not be afraid to ask for help. ",89,mtms2012-11-244a,,
"If your district has an onsite technology coordinator, be sure to draw on his or her professional expertise. Technology coordinators are knowledgeable about filters that are in place on the district’s network that can inadvertently block a website you wish to use in your classroom. These coordinators can also help you keep current on technology policies of the district. ",90,mtms2012-11-244a,,
"Online help resources are often  underused. A Web search can uncover video, website, and chat tutorials that can guide you through problems. The individual piece of hardware or software you are using will often have video tutorials or support on a website. Take the initiative in the same way you would want your students to be proactive in mathematical learning. ",91,mtms2012-11-244a,,
When Technology Falters,92,mtms2012-11-244a,,
"As with any other planned lesson, the technology that is necessary for an activity occasionally fails. Recognize that troubleshooting can be generalized to other more familiar software and hardware. If you can use Microsoft Word, then you can use Google Docs (www.docs.google.com). Some differences are inherent, but a focus on similarities can assist in problem solving. ",93,mtms2012-11-244a,,
"Most problems can be prevented  with additional preparation. No  teacher wants to spend hours fixing each student’s individual technology issue. Give general hints and tips: For almost everything that could go wrong, one of your students should be able to help. Teach students to become selfsufficient in solving their own problems, similar to how we want them to learn math. Students need to explore and question, and not have every aspect explained to them. They should explore these common potential solutions before asking a teacher for help: •	 Verify	the	web	address.	 •	 Check	the	Internet	connection.",94,mtms2012-11-244a,,
•	 Restart	the	Internet	connection.,95,mtms2012-11-244a,,
•	 Restart	the	web	browser.,96,mtms2012-11-244a,,
•	 Ask	for	peer	assistance.	 •	 Restart	the	computer.,97,mtms2012-11-244a,,
It is important to note that teachers must spend extra time making sure everything works and uncovering problems before students encounter them. ,98,mtms2012-11-244a,,
Keeping Students on Task,99,mtms2012-11-244a,,
"With so many websites for students to explore and opportunities to be off task, how does a teacher ensure that students are productive? Some software programs monitor students’ computer usage, but perhaps a better approach to keeping students on task is to assign something interesting and worthwhile. There is no worse feeling than watching bored students wandering off in the vast world of technology, losing the opportunity for mathematical learning. Set clear expectations and focus on why the work is important rather than the consequences for being off task. Challenge each student and let him or her know that the goal is to be responsible for one’s individual math learning. Students are then empowered to take learning into their own hands in a fun and creative manner. With technology, the possibilities are endless.",100,mtms2012-11-244a,,
