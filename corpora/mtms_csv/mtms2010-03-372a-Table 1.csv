"It is worth noting, referring to Lauren L. Wagener’s nice article “A Worthwhile Task to Teach Slope” in the October 2009 issue, that not all springs conform to Hooke’s law. The springs need to be helical, which means that they must not deform permanently with a certain threshold of strain.",11,mtms2010-03-372a,,
"They should exhibit simple  harmonic motion (bounce a little), when appropriate weights have been added. A modest investigation at the hardware store with various springs will usually provide satisfactory results if you cannot find the right spring in a catalogue. For an ideal experiment, several springs with varying spring constants could be used.",12,mtms2010-03-372a,,

"I appreciated Thomas Freiling’s letter in “Readers Write” titled “Finding the LCM: An Alternative Approach” in the October 2009 issue. I have a similar method to find the least common multiple (LCM), but it is structured differently. ",16,mtms2010-03-372a,,

(a) (b) use the traditional dividing algorithm. Here is how it works.,23,mtms2010-03-372a,,
"Let’s begin by finding the LCM of 16 and 20. First, you would write the two numbers in the traditional division algorithm. Then the student should see if 2 is a factor of both numbers and continue to divide by 2 as many times as possible. Then continue with the rest of the primes until there are no more common factors. See the steps in figure 1.",24,mtms2010-03-372a,,
"From this model, the student can  glean three concepts.  1.  The GCF is the product of the  numbers along the left that were divided out. See figure 2.  2.  If 16 and 20 were in a fraction 16/20, the student would then have the simplified fraction. See figure 3.",25,mtms2010-03-372a,,
3.  The LCM can be found in two different ways. See figure 4a and 4b.,26,mtms2010-03-372a,,

"GCF and LCM to show how the numbers, factors, and multiples are all connected. ",28,mtms2010-03-372a,,
One of my passions is to use stu- dents’ individual strengths and find as many ways as I can to connect other concepts to students’ current background knowledge. This approach could be used if a student does not understand the traditional way that this concept is taught. ,29,mtms2010-03-372a,,

I disagree slightly with the answer provided to problem 3 in September’s “Palette of Problems.” The problem and its solution follow:,33,mtms2010-03-372a,,
"Problem 3. You are shown two boxes that are the same size, box 1 and box 2. You are told that one box contains twice as much money as the other, although you are not told which is which. You choose box 1 and open it. It is filled with fifty $10 bills. You now get the opportunity to open box 2, but if you do, you must give back box 1. Box 2 could have twice as much money (fifty $20 bills) or half as much (fifty $5 bills). Should you choose box 2 or keep box 1? Write an explanation of your reasoning.",34,mtms2010-03-372a,,
"Solution 3. The probability is .5 that your first choice will be the best. When you find out that the box contains $10 bills, you have no additional information about which box has more money. The probability of picking the greater amount of money with box 2 is still .5. ",35,mtms2010-03-372a,,
"If all things were equal, it is true that you would have a 50 percent chance of  doubling your money and a 50 percent chance of cutting your money in half. On that basis, I agree that this scenario alone would not give any substantial reason to switch boxes. However, there is more to the problem. ",36,mtms2010-03-372a,,
"If you look at the problem not based solely on the chance to win or lose but at risk versus reward, it makes more sense to switch boxes. If you switch, you essentially risk only $250. If you are wrong, you go from $500 to $250, which is a net loss of $250. If you are correct, you go from $500 to $1000, a net gain of $500. From a risk versus reward standpoint, it is to your benefit to switch boxes. You risk only $250 each time you  switch for a chance to win $500 more. Another way to think about this is to look at the situation if simulated ten times. If you do not switch, you would earn $5000. Although this would not always work in real-life trials, theoretically you would double your money five times and cut it in half five times. The end result would be 5($1000) boxes and 5($250) boxes, or $6250 after ten simulations. Switching would then be more beneficial because you would have $6250 versus the $5000 if you never switched.",37,mtms2010-03-372a,,
