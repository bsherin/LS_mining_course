The Proof Is in the Practice,2,mtms2011-05-522a,,
"Imagine an eighth-grade classroom where students are exploring relationships between the heights and areas of rectangles (Ellis 2011). They are investigating a special set of rectangles that grow in a particular way by iterating the height and length values so that the rectangles remain similar. One set of these rectangles is seen in figure 1. The students create tables, comparing the rectangles’ heights and areas, and notice something interesting: The second differences for the area are always constant, no matter what type of rectangle the students use (see fig. 2). One student, Sara, makes the conjecture that this will be the case for any rectangle. ",3,mtms2011-05-522a,,
The teacher recognizes this as an  opportunity to discuss proof. She asks her students the following questions:  •	 What	do	the	second	differences	 mean? •	 Why	are	they	constant? •	 Will	they	always	be	constant?,4,mtms2011-05-522a,,
"This situation is ideal for giving students the opportunity to develop proofs. The students notice something interesting about their tables: Sara’s conjecture hints at a relationship that the teacher knows will always hold. Moreover, the teacher wants the students to use this opportunity to understand more about the quadratic relationship between the rectangles’ heights and areas. She asks the students to work in pairs and reminds them to focus on justifying their ideas. ",5,mtms2011-05-522a,,
"When sharing their work, the students explain that the first differences represent how much area is added each time the rectangle grows. The second differences represent “the area of the amount added to the previous area,” explains Bianca. Tai agrees: “It’s the amount added to the amount added to the area.” The students share drawings of growing rectangles and identify the additional area from one iteration to the next. For instance, when the original blue rectangle in figure 3 grows to become ",6,mtms2011-05-522a,,

"The scenario above may be familiar to teachers who try to help their students develop proofs. Forming deductive arguments that go beyond 5-gon examples is difficult for students at all grade levels (Balacheff 1988; Knuth, Choppin, and Bieda 2009; Martin and Harel 1989). Students find examples-based arguments convincing, and they may also be convinced by arguments that appeal to author- 6-gon hexagon 6-gon hexagon 5-gon pentagon ity, rely on perception, or otherwise depend on a justification that is not deductive (Harel and Sowder 2007).

"Pleased with how the students made sense of the first and second differences, the teacher then asks them to justify why the second differences remain constant for any set of rectangles whose dimensions grow proportionally. In this case, however, each student’s proof relies on the use of a specific example.  4-gon square 3-gon triangle and shows that the second differences would be 6 square centimeters each time the height grows by 1 cm and the length grows by 3 cm.

"Janie and Sam rely on examples to show that the identity is true; Malia relies on an authority-based argument. To help the class see the ﬂ aws in examples-based proofs, the teacher asks her students to consider how many examples they would need to prove the identity. Students reply with three, fi ve, and less than ten. Travis, another student, argues differently: ",31,mtms2011-05-522a,,
"We thought that you have to try every single number there is because just because it works for, like, maybe twenty or thirty of them . . . it might not work for thirty-one, ’cause you haven’t tried it yet. And so you have to fi nd, to make sure that it works for everything, you have to try everything. So you have to fi nd some way to explain it in words. (Boaler and Humphreys 2005)",32,mtms2011-05-522a,,
The teacher highlights Travis’s reasoning to help her students understand that examples would not be suffi cient to prove the identity. This example leads to the creation of several viable proofs (see fi g. 4).,33,mtms2011-05-522a,,
"Although proof can be diffi cult,  middle school students and even younger can and do create mathematically appropriate proofs (Ellis 2007; Stylianides and Stylianides 2008; Zack 1997). In fact, proof has been shown to play an important role in promoting deep learning in mathematics (Hanna 2000; Yackel and Hanna 2003), and it can help support students’ mathematical discoveries.",34,mtms2011-05-522a,,
"Consider Andy’s and Hannah’s  attempts at proofs in fi gure 5. Andy’s response is a typical examples-based argument, but Hannah produces a more general argument that does not  rely on particular numbers.

"That means you don’t even have to increase the largest value. If you increase any number, the mean has to go up, because it’s like adding f to anything!",38,mtms2011-05-522a,,
The teacher uses this discussion to launch a deeper exploration about which factors affect the mean and by how much.,39,mtms2011-05-522a,,
"Just as teachers’ actions can help  students move beyond examples-based reasoning and launch deeper investigations, the way that tasks are written can also encourage proof in middle school (Ball and Bass 2003; Bieda 2010).

When a justification comes  from another student rather than from the teacher, students may be more willing to critique it and agree or disagree on the basis of the merits of the argument. For instance, for the identity 2(n – 1) = 2n – 2, a teacher could introduce the proof that argues that 2(n – 1) can be expressed as  (n – 1) + (n – 1) (see fig. 4) and gauge students’ reaction to this argument. It can also, at times, be helpful to  3-gon triangle introduce an argument that is incorrect to assess what students find convincing. A teacher could introduce Sam’s answer (see p. 523’s dialogue) and ask whether his proof is more convincing than Janie’s proof, because Sam uses extreme examples in addition to smaller numbers.  2. Ask students to explain in a different way",50,mtms2011-05-522a,,
"It is not uncommon for students to get stuck or be unable to produce a justification. Pushing students to move beyond rudimentary explanations can increase their capacities for proof (Ball and Bass 2003). Ask students to provide a different argument, to use a different representation, or to draw a picture. For the 2(n – 1) = 2n – 2 identity, a teacher could ask students to draw a picture of (n – 1) and 2(n – 1). This could lead to the image in figure 4a.

"Source: Adapted from deLange et al. (2006, p. 35) students may be too wedded to one particular representation to move to a more general argument, as in the scenario with the growing rectangles. In this case, a teacher might ask students to create a different picture that does not rely on a specific rectangle or to work with an algebraic representation.  3. Point out what makes a justification valid",53,mtms2011-05-522a,,
"In addition to understanding why particular proofs may not be sufficient, students need help understanding what constitutes a mathematically appropriate justification. Emphasize what makes a particular justification appropriate (Ball and Bass 2003). For instance, Hannah’s answer (see fig. 5) is a powerful justification because it does not rely on specific numbers but instead makes a general argument. A teacher could emphasize the difference between Hannah’s answer and another hypothetical student’s answer, such as Andy’s, and ask students to think about how they could further generalize Hannah’s justification.  4. Emphasize explaining “why”",54,mtms2011-05-522a,,
"Showing that a conjecture is always true may not be strong motivation to create a proof, because students may already be convinced from trying several examples. Ask students to explain why a conjecture must be true; at that point, proof becomes a way for students to make sense of what is happening. For instance, the textbook example in figure 7, involving interior angles of polygons, asks students to develop a pattern but does not address why that pattern makes sense or where it comes from. Being able to explain why the formula 180°(n – 2) makes sense can encourage students to develop a proof that goes beyond showing that the pattern works with different examples. Extensions to promote student responses to the “why” question are shown in figure 8.",55,mtms2011-05-522a,,

When their teacher redirects their attention to the figures, the students are able to formulate a justification. ",61,mtms2011-05-522a,,
"The students who work with the  growing rectangles reach a breakthrough when one student, Daeshim, is able to imagine a general H × L growing rectangle. He calls the first differences the “rate of growth” (or RoG) of the area; he calls the second differences the “difference in the rate of growth” (or DiRoG). He draws the picture in figure 9 and determines that since he can calculate the difference in the rate of growth each time as 2HL, it will not only always be constant but will also be twice the area of the original rectangle. ",62,mtms2011-05-522a,,
"By pushing the students to develop  an appropriate proof, even after they appear stuck, the teacher is able to foster a deeper understanding of the  first and second differences for quadratic growth. The students are able to eventually create algebraic representations of the quadratic relationship between height and area. ",63,mtms2011-05-522a,,
Providing regular opportunities for students to prove and explicitly supporting students’ emerging proof abilities will help middle school students not only become more adept at proving but also develop a deeper understanding of the mathematics they investigate. ,64,mtms2011-05-522a,,
