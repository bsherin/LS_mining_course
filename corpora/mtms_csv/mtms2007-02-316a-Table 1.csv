Computing Quartiles: It’s All in the Cards!,2,mtms2007-02-316a,,
"T HE  prOCEDurE  fOr  COMpuTING  quArtiles is relatively simple; or is it? Step 1: find the median of your data set. Step 2: find the median of the lower half of the data set. Call this number q1. Step 3: find the median of the upper half of the data set. Call this number q3. You are finished. But if these steps are all that a student has been taught, would he or she be able to successfully respond to these questions? •  Why are these items called quartiles? •  What happened to q2? •  How is q1 related to the data set? How is q1 re- •  Create a data set that has fifteen data points and a  lated to q3? q1 of 43 and a q3 of 78.",3,mtms2007-02-316a,,
"We often assume that students would be able to successfully  respond  to  these  prompts,  given  the ease of the procedure, but it is unlikely. How can a teacher enable students to gain an understanding of quartiles while developing skill with the procedure? This article shares an activity I have used with my students to do just that.",4,mtms2007-02-316a,,

A Card Activity,8,mtms2007-02-316a,,
"I STArT BY GIvING EACH STuDENT A SET Of CArDS numbered 1 through 12. (Note: A single suit of regular playing cards can be used, with the ace representing 1 and the jack and queen representing 11 and 12, respectively.) The numbers on the cards represent the numbers in the data sets. We begin with a quick review of finding the median by laying out the cards 1 through 6 in order. Students are asked to divide the data set (the cards) into two equal parts. Then I ask the students what number is dividing the set in two and what statistical measure this represents. We repeat this exercise with the cards 1 through 5. This time, however, the students face a dilemma in dividing the cards into two equal parts because I quickly caution, “Don’t tear my cards!” (which usually receives a chuckle from the students). At this point, we discuss that the middle card, 3, is the median and does not fall into either half. Figure 1 shows the data set and the median.",9,mtms2007-02-316a,,

"Fig. 3  Sample data sets with Q1, the median, and Q3 represented quartiles. Students are directed to lay out the cards 1 through 12 and divide this data set into four equal parts.  Students  share  the  process  they  used.  At this point, I introduce the quartiles, which students quickly connect to the idea of quarters or fourths. Students identify the median of the set, in this case, 6.5. They are asked to identify the number that divided the bottom half (3.5) and the upper half (9.5). The terms q1 and q3 are then introduced. Figure 2 depicts this data set. Students are then ready to identify q1, the median, and q3 for data sets containing 9,  10, and 11 numbers (see fig. 3). While working with the cards, students are encouraged to draw pictures of the card representation for each data set.  finally, students find q1, the median, and q3 for other data sets that have larger numbers, repeated numbers,  and  numbers  that  are  out  of  order.  Because  of  their  earlier  work  representing  quartiles pictorially, students naturally draw similar pictures for data sets that cannot be represented by the cards and  are  then  successful  at  identifying  q1,  the  median, and q3.",29,mtms2007-02-316a,,

The Beneﬁ ts of the Activity,32,mtms2007-02-316a,,
"THErE  ArE  SEvErAL  BENEfITS  TO this card activity. first, the use of number  cards  allows  students  to  manipulate the data set physically by placing the numbers in order, then separating them into the quartiles. This concrete experience  with  the  concept  is  benefi cial for all students exposed to this concept for the fi rst time. Second, the separation  of  the  number  cards  into the  quartiles  provides  a  powerful  visual  of  the  concept,  which  benefi ts visual learners. However, all students gain a greater understanding of what quartiles  represent  and  how  they  relate to the data set through this representation. This display also provides a strong connection to the development of  box-and-whisker  plots,  the  graphical  representation  of  a  data  set  that generally  follows  the  exploration  of quartiles. finally, students who might have  struggled  with  memorizing  the steps  to  this  procedure  tend  to  be more  successful  because  the  activity makes sense.

"I HAvE SHArED THIS ACTIvITY WITH middle  school including those who teach students with special needs.  They  have  all  commented  on how much the students enjoyed working with the cards and how the activity enabled their students to develop both skill  and  understanding  in  working with  quartiles.  These  students  were able to identify q1 and q3 and successfully  respond  to  the  previous  list  of questions. I am sure your students will benefi t from this activity, as well. ",35,mtms2007-02-316a,,
