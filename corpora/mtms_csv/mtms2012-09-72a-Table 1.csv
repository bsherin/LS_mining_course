Published solutions will be credited.  oOne of the challenging aspects of  writing and administering a rich mathematical task is trying to ascertain the different ways in which students could potentially interpret a task. The wording of the task and the manner in which the task is presented can make huge differences in the results produced by students. The Shaded Rectangles task is a prime example of this scenario. For this Solve It! we received widely differing student work from two teachers. Joanne Walker addressed the fi rst part of the task, drawing and dividing a rectangle into various parts, with her sixth graders. Walker read the task to her students, without providing images of the rectangles. As a result, her students produced drawings of shaded rectangles that differed from what we expected. ",8,mtms2012-09-72a,,
"Lori Knox, an eighth-grade teach- er, sent us responses to the second part of the task, which asked: “What fractions of Bryan’s and Brenda’s rectangles are shaded?” Her students segmented the triangles and rectangles to help calculate the area, and they often included a written component that discussed what they had done. ",9,mtms2012-09-72a,,
"This same task, presented in different ways, produced very different sets of student work. The same situation happens frequently in classroom settings when students read and interpret a task in different ways. Although the task completed by each student varied according to his or her interpretation, each solution presented opportunities to discuss different worthwhile mathematical ideas. We will explore Walker’s work, then Knox’s contributions, then refl ect further on the task itself and its wording.",10,mtms2012-09-72a,,
"Walker gave her students blank sheets of paper and asked them to draw rectangles. This assignment resulted in rectangles that varied in size; some nearly fi lled the page while others measured only 1 in. × 2 in. All  but one student drew the sides of the rectangle parallel to the sides of their paper, and only two students produced nearly square rectangles. Students then divided the sides of the height into 3 congruent line segments and the base into 4 congruent segments. Students completed the next part of the task that asked them to draw segments to connect the point just below the top-left corner of their rectangle to the other points in the rectangle. The directions in the published version then asked students to shade every other section. ",11,mtms2012-09-72a,,
"The fi nal design, a rectangle that should have been divided into eleven triangular regions with six shaded, was not what we received. Since the students were not shown the sample designs, they had no preconceived ideas of the fi nal product. Therefore, we received several different interpretations of the directions. Many students produced a drawing similar to McKenna’s (see fi g. 1a). She successfully divided the base and height into the appropriate number of congruent parts but did not consider the vertices as points on the rectangle to connect in the next step. As a result, not all shapes formed were triangles; she created only nine sections with fi ve shaded triangles. Roy (see fi g. 1b) shaded every other section after the fi rst. His drawing had nine sections but only ",12,mtms2012-09-72a,,

"Lisa Keller, Program Coordinator 517.432.5472, kellerl@msu.edu  four were shaded. Joey produced an interesting interpretation (see fig. 1c). He clearly divided his sides correctly, making small segments, or “notches,” between each segment of equal length. He then interpreted points “in the rectangle” as being interior to the rectangle and connected the endpoints of his notches, creating shapes that were not triangles. ",19,mtms2012-09-72a,,
"When we first saw all these drawings, we were a little confused, much like any teacher who assigns a task that he or she thinks is clear but who then receives unexpected results and interpretations. However, as we looked at the task as it was published, we understood students’ interpretations because they did not view the sample drawings in the original problem. Students then completed the work as presented to them. Although the task as published was not what we intended, the student work still provided insights into their thinking, which can lead to rich mathematical discussions.",20,mtms2012-09-72a,,
"Discussing the concept of the  endpoint of the segments, versus the “notches,” could lead to deeper understanding by students of segments and their endpoints. Additionally, none of the students considered the vertices of the rectangle as points to connect, even though most used them as endpoints of their congruent segments. Their thinking about what constituted an endpoint may be further explored.",21,mtms2012-09-72a,,
"A number of students did not  make their segments of equal length, perhaps because they did not under- stand the term congruent. Others made equal-length segments but did not use the entire side and simply ignored the “extra.” Others made 4 equally spaced points that created 5 segments, rather than marking 3 equally spaced points to create 4 segments on a side. Any and all of these responses were representative of possible misunderstandings associated ",22,mtms2012-09-72a,,
Fig. 2 Maddy’s work exhibited a high level of understanding about area and adding fractional parts.,23,mtms2012-09-72a,,
"Maddy’s work on the   “Brenda’s rectangle” portion   of the original   task with terminology, geometric ideas, or measurement that could be addressed in future class discussions. ",24,mtms2012-09-72a,,
"Knox sent us samples of her  eighth-grade students’ work that was based on the second part of the task. Her presentation was completely different from Walker’s. She simply added a sentence of directions at the top of the task, asking students to solve the problem and to provide a detailed explanation. ",25,mtms2012-09-72a,,
"Her students focused on calculating area. They did not draw their own rectangles but simply worked with the two that were provided. All their work showed a correct response of 7/12. However, as you analyze the way that they found their answers, you can see significant differences in their level of understanding of measurement, area, and fractions. For example, Maddy never used square units or even discussed area formulas; instead, she looked at the rectangle as the whole and how the whole was broken into fractional pieces (see fig. 2). She also saw the similarity between Brenda’s and Bryan’s rectangle without actually  calculating the results. She thought in terms of fractional pieces of a whole and saw relationships between the sizes of the pieces. Maddy explained, ",26,mtms2012-09-72a,,
"By recognizing divisions of the rectangles into easy fractions like 1/3 or 1/2, I was able to find the fraction of the total that each shaded portion was.",27,mtms2012-09-72a,,
"She saw the top piece as 1/3 of the rectangle and the larger right triangle as 1/2 of this 1/3. She also recognized that the remaining 1/2 of the 1/3 was cut into four triangles that all had the same size base and height, so they were all the same area. As a result, she took 2/4 of 1/2 of 1/3 to get the two smaller shaded triangles in the top 1/3 as 2/24, or 1/12. She circled 1/6 and 1/12 for the shaded part in the top. She then moved to the bottom 2/3 of the rectangle and saw that the large shaded triangle was 1/2 of 1/2 of 2/3, or 1/6. Finally, she recognized that the other two shaded triangles were composed of 1/2 of the other 1/2 of 2/3, so it was also 1/6, for a total of 2/6 from the bottom portion of the rectangle. She added the 2/6 to the 3/12 from the top and found 7/12. She used very sophisticated thinking about the relationships found among the sizes of the triangles in relation to the rectangle. We would love to see more students exhibit this sort of thinking.",28,mtms2012-09-72a,,
"Other students in Knox’s class attempted strategies that relied on using formulas to calculate area. When we looked at some of their work, we saw that another group of three students began by stating that the rectangle was 1 whole, so we expected to see some of Maddy’s reasoning again. However, this group then assigned lengths to the pieces of the sides as 1/3 or 1/4, as if they were 1/3 or 1/4 of the same length. They analyzed these lengths to calculate the area of each triangle using the formula  A = (1/2)bh and summed all the shaded triangles. Although this resulted in the same overall answer of 7/12, it was unclear to us if these students really understood that they were taking 1/3 of the height of the rectangle and 1/4 of the base of the rectangle, which were not same-size units. This point might seem minor, but as we looked at the work of other students, we began to see the nature of our concern. ",29,mtms2012-09-72a,,
"Several other students began work  by assigning the length of the base as 4 and height as 3, so that each segment had a length of 1. They saw no problem using different-size units. The task specifically stated that the area of the rectangle was 12 square units. Unfortunately, that was not reflected with either of the rectangles provided, since the “units” they were assigning were not the same size. It would be similar to saying that a  3 cm × 4 inch rectangle has an area of 12 square units. What would those square units be called? This scenario may have occurred because the congruent segments in Bryan’s rectangle were similar in length. But then what happened in Brenda’s rectangle? Some students still considered it to be a 3 × 4 with 12 square units. Others decided that it was not correct, since the units for the height were clearly longer than the units for the base. Students made each segment on the base a length of 1 and each segment on the height a length of 2, resulting in 24 square units. At this point, it was clear that they were aware that the divisions were not the same size, but they were unable to work with them in any general form without assigning numerical values to them. ",30,mtms2012-09-72a,,
"In every case, students found the correct solution of 7/12, so why the fuss? We believe that the beauty of an open-ended task was how it illuminated both what students knew and did not know. Looking beyond the answer will ascertain if students truly  understood the mathematical principles and concepts. These students were all skillful at using formulas to find the areas of rectangles and triangles, but did they understand the idea of square units? Did they understand the need to measure both dimensions using the same-size unit? These issues could then be discussed and clarified. ",31,mtms2012-09-72a,,
ReFlection on the tasK,32,mtms2012-09-72a,,
"As we looked at the task that was published and then examined the two sets of student work, we were reminded that how we presented a question and how the text was worded were extremely important to the types of responses received. On reflection, we would make several changes to this task. Specifically, we would make the two parts more explicit. Part 1 would ask students to draw the figure, and part 2 would ask students to answer the question about Bryan’s and Brenda’s rectangles. ",33,mtms2012-09-72a,,
"Within part 1, we would be more  specific, asking students to place points on the rectangle that divided the base into 4 congruent segments and the height into 3 congruent segments, so that it would be clear what “points” they should be connecting. Instead of saying “in” the rectangle, we would use “on” the rectangle. Finally, instead of asking students to shade every other region, it would be appropriate to ask them to shade the triangle at the  upper-left corner and then shade every other triangular region. This might reduce the variability in the shaded regions that students created. ",34,mtms2012-09-72a,,
"In part 2, we would also ask if  the same fraction of their rectangle formed in part 1 was also shaded. Finally, we would ask if every shaded rectangle created in this manner would have the same fractional amount shaded. These modified instructions might help move more students toward discussing the fractional parts of a whole rectangle and seeing relationships as did Maddy when she said, “I realized they were the same lines within different shapes, really the same shape turned 90 degrees.” ",35,mtms2012-09-72a,,
"Whenever we write a task and  try it with students, we find ways to improve it. When we first use a task, it does not always go as planned.
