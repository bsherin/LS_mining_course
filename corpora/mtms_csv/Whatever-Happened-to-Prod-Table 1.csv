0,Whatever Happened to Productive Disposition_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In 2001, Kilpatrick, Swafford, and Findell proposed a new way to look at what it means for students to be mathematically proficient. They described mathematical proficiency as comprising five intertwined strands: procedural fluency, conceptual understanding, adaptive reasoning, strategic competence, and productive disposition. The vision is that these proficiencies develop together, each reinforcing one another and each being critical to a student becoming mathematically proficient. With the advent of the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSI) in 2010, four of these strands were expanded and adapted to become part of the eight Standards for Mathematical Practice. As I visit classrooms, it is reassuring to see a list of these mathematical practices prominently displayed in classrooms and to see teachers and curriculum developers trying to incorporate the ideas into their mathematics classrooms. Conspicuously absent, however, from these new standards is the strand of mathematical proficiency called productive disposition. It is mentioned in the introduction to the Standards for Mathematical Practice, but it is not incorporated into the individual standards.",,
1,Whatever Happened to Productive Disposition_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Productive disposition refers to the tendency to see sense in mathematics, to perceive it as both useful and worthwhile, to believe that steady effort in learning mathematics pays off, and to see oneself as an effective learner and doer of mathematics (Kilpatrick, Swafford, and Findell 2001, p. 131). Productive disposition develops alongside other strands and is critical for their development. Kilpatrick, Swafford,and Findell state, If students are to develop conceptual understanding, procedural fluency, strategic competence, and adaptive reasoning abilities, they must believe that mathematics is understandable, not arbitrary; that, with diligent effort, it can be learned and used; and that they are capable of figuring it out (p. 131).",,

3,Whatever Happened to Productive Disposition_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Despite the importance of this strand of mathematical proficiency, productive disposition is mentioned only in the introduction to the Common Cores Standards of Mathematical Practice, not explicitly codified in the eight practices. It is not difficult to see how the other practices rely on productive disposition. For example, it would be very difficult for students to Look for and make use of structure (CCSSI 2010, p. 8) in mathematics if they did not believe that mathematics had a sensible structure. Likewise, a student who does not believe that effort pays off in mathematics is very unlikely to Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them (CCSSI 2010, p. 6). Because productive disposition is not explicitly built into the Standards for Mathematical Practices, my concern is that it seems to be getting left out of the discussion about how we want students to engage in mathematics. At conferences, in classrooms, and in new curriculum materials, we discuss how to help students reason about mathematics, develop conceptual understanding, become strategic problems solvers, and develop procedural fluency. Very seldom do we talk about how to help students develop mathematical dispositions to support these other practices.",,
4,Whatever Happened to Productive Disposition_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"NCTMs Principles to Actions: Ensuring Mathematical Success for All (2014) examines educational principles to help in the development of the strands of mathematical proficiency and the Standards for Mathematical Practice. As the authors discuss each practice, they point out how the practice contributes to the development of particular strands of proficiency or mathematical practices. Again, little is said about the development of productive disposition. The importance of this strand of mathematical proficiency is acknowledged in introductory material but little discussion occurs about helping students develop this disposition.",,

6,Whatever Happened to Productive Disposition_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Both the research on students beliefs and conceptions and my experiences teaching mathematics demonstrate that many students tend not to display a productive disposition toward mathematics. Students often do not view mathematics as being sensible or related to the real world. Petocz et al. (2007) found more than one-half of undergraduates majoring in mathematics-related fields conceived of mathematics as merely manipulation with numbers (p. 445) or as a collection of isolated techniques (p. 446). Crawford et al. (1994) found that more than 75 percent of college freshman conceive of mathematics as a fragmented body of knowledge (p. 457). Too often, students walking into my mathematics classroom do not even consider asking about or exploring how what they learn makes sense because they do not expect it to make sense.",,
7,Whatever Happened to Productive Disposition_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"It is also too common for students and others to believe that success in mathematics is related to inherent ability rather than persistent hard work. When people first find out that I teach mathematics, the most common reaction is some variant of Oh, I was never any good at math. I just dont have a head for math. This is often followed by a story about a friend or relative who is really good at math. This is the opposite of the growth mindset advocated by Dweck (2006). Her assertion is that we need to recognize our ability to change and grow by applying ourselves to challenging situations. This type of mindset in relation to mathematics is often lacking in our students.",,
8,Whatever Happened to Productive Disposition_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Given the difficulties that students seem to have with productive disposition and its central role in mathematics learning, we must focus more of our attention on how to help our students develop this strand of mathematical proficiency. We need to consider ways to find out more about students beliefs about mathematics and mathematics learning. We need to examine how our instructional practices influence students dispositions toward mathematics, and we need to look more at how students mathematical dispositions are related to the Standards for Mathematical Practice.",,
9,Whatever Happened to Productive Disposition_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Unfortunately, few resources are available to teachers who wish to engage in this endeavor. Several survey-type instruments have been used to evaluate students conceptions about mathematics and mathematics learning (i.e., Brown et al. 1988; Grouws 1996; Kloosterman and Stage 1992; Schoenfeld 1989). I created a framework of action-oriented indicators that can be used to observe students conceptions of mathematics as sensible (Grady 2013). In this same work, I also describe a group interview in which students talk about their conceptions of mathematics as being sensible. Beyond that, there is little research or advice about how to evaluate students productive dispositions toward mathematics.",,
10,Whatever Happened to Productive Disposition_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,ADDRESSING THE NEED,,
11,Whatever Happened to Productive Disposition_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"A few hints are found in the literature about instructional practices that may be helpful for the development of different aspects of productive disposition. For example, Boaler (1998) describes a link between students engagement in project-based learning and their tendency to see mathematics as useful. Similarly, Blad (2015) argues that the development of a growth mindset in mathematics is linked to engagement with open-ended, multidimensional mathematics problems. The work of these and other authors point toward ways to help our students develop more productive dispositions toward mathematics, but there is still much work to be done to understand this vital strand of mathematical proficiency. What do our students believe about the nature of mathematics and mathematics learning? How are these beliefs impacting their learning? What can we do to help students develop a more productive disposition toward mathematics? These are vital questions for us to talk about and think about as we plan learning opportunities for our students and as we consider engaging in action research in our classrooms.",,
