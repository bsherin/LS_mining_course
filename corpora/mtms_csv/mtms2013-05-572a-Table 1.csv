The Bridge to  Mathematics  and Literature,1,mtms2013-05-572a,,
"Donna Christy, Christine Payson, and Patricia Carnevale  wWhere can your students embark on  an adventure with heroine Katniss Everdeen and use algebraic thinking to keep food and supplies safely hidden? Where are your students challenged to investigate linear relationships by staying in the scary Westing house? To avoid the wrath of Egyptian gods, where must your students hide to solve a hieroglyphic puzzle using integers? In which location can your students use scale factors to dine with a giant? The answer? Your classroom. It is a prime location for integrating ﬁction with fact and for immersing your students in rich mathematical experiences.",2,mtms2013-05-572a,,

"Edited by James Dogbey, jdogbey@ clemson.edu, Clemson University, South Carolina, and Barbara Zorin, drbzorin@ gmail.com, University of South Florida. Readers are encouraged to submit manuscripts through http://mtms.msubmit.net.  ing problems can be suggested by everyday experiences, such as reading literature” (NCTM 2000, p. 256). To that end, we undertook a journey into the world of middle-grades literature to seek opportunities to connect literature with mathematics. This journey included consulting librarians, teachers, and students; perusing book lists; and reading ﬁction. For each book read, we kept a journal that chronicled mathematical ideas suggested by the characters, themes, and events. The result was a collection of ﬁfteen Standards-based activities spanning four books. ",4,mtms2013-05-572a,,
IMPLEMENT THE ACTIVITIES,5,mtms2013-05-572a,,
"Connecting mathematics and literature provides the opportunity for teachers to co-plan lessons. This interdisciplinary approach is at the heart of the middle school model. For students who have read or are reading a particular book, a corresponding activity serves to deepen their  experience with the book itself; for students who have not read the book connected to the lesson, an activity may motivate them to read it. With these goals in mind, it is not necessary to have read the particular book to complete the activity. ",6,mtms2013-05-572a,,
"The activities presented here can be implemented in many ways. They can launch, explore, reinforce, or extend topics and concepts. For differentiation, appropriate modiﬁcations can be made. Individuals, pairs, or teams could work on a single activity simultaneously. Stations can be arranged so that teams work on activities in a round-robin format. Portfolio submissions or weekly mathematics-literature mini investigations can become assessment options. Another option is a project that combines mathematics, English, and language arts. Students could keep a journal for a book being read by listing mathematics ideas suggested by its characters, themes, or events, then write a summary and at ",7,mtms2013-05-572a,,

"Whether done individually or in  teams, using the same or different books, student presentations are the culminating event. During a presentation, problems can be presented for teams to work on or be collected and used later. For this project, the teacher serves as facilitator and editor for student-created problems. On a larger scale, a team can host a school mathematics-literature event. ",29,mtms2013-05-572a,,

"Each activity is titled by the book from which it was inspired and an activity name. The introductory paragraph, a quotation from the book, is meant to spark interest in the mathematics to be explored. Table 1 displays the book and activity titles, along with main grades 6−8 Standards that are addressed. ",31,mtms2013-05-572a,,
IGNITE THE IMAGINATION,32,mtms2013-05-572a,,
"Literature spanning classics to contemporary can be geared for the middle school student. Integrating  mathematics and literature offers opportunities to ignite the imagination and creativity of students and teachers. At the same time, Content and Process Standards (NCTM 2000) and the Standards for Mathematical Practice listed in the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSI 2010) are addressed. Inspire your students to turn on a light in the mathematics classroom.",33,mtms2013-05-572a,,
