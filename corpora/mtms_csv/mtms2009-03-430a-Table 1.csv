"The vision for mathematics education described in Principles and Standards for School Mathematics is highly ambitious. Achieving it requires solid mathematics curricula, competent and knowledgeable teachers who can integrate instruction and assessment, education policies that enhance and support learning, classrooms with ready access to technology, and a commitment to both equity and excellence. (NCTM 2000, p. 3) ",3,mtms2009-03-430a,,
"As the quote above indicates, electronic tools to support the teaching of mathematics can be an important part of teachers’ resources for promoting student learning of mathematics. The three articles in this month’s “Contemporary Curriculum Issues” series collectively focus on issues relevant to improving the effectiveness of electronic tools in classrooms; the support needed for teachers to use calculators in interesting and useful ways; examples of ways that existing and emerging technologies can encourage, support, and enhance students’ engagement with and learning of mathematics; and the impact of electronic computer algebra systems (CAS) on the learning of algebra. The series editors encourage you to read the “Contemporary Curriculum Issues” articles in each of the three school journals, Teaching Children Mathematics, Mathematics Teaching in the Middle School, and the Mathematics Teacher. Each article explores effective, grade-appropriate uses of electronic tools in mathematics classrooms. Knowing what experiences with technology students may bring to your grade level and what the expectations are for grades following yours can help you build smoother transitions for the students. The TCM article by Chval and Hicks considers the support that district-adopted textbook materials provide to teachers for using calculators effectively. The MT article by Zbiek and Heid explores features of CAS, particularly when used as part of a classroom tool set, and addresses several ways in which CAS can cause the taught and learned curriculum to focus on big mathematical ideas that might previously have escaped students’ attention.",4,mtms2009-03-430a,,
"Richard hollenbeck, rhollenb@umd.edu, works in the Center for Mathematics Education at the University of Maryland. While writing this manuscript, he taught eighth-grade mathematics at Harper’s Choice Middle School in Columbia, Maryland. He is interested in improving mathematics instruction through technology integration. James Fey, jimfey@ umd.edu, is Professor Emeritus in the Department of Mathematics and the Department of Curriculum and Instruction at the University of Maryland.

"This department provides a forum to stimulate discussion on contemporary curricular issues across a K–12 audience. NCTM plans to publish sets of three articles, focused on a single curriculum issue. Each article will address the issue from the perspective of the audience of the journal in which it appears. Collectively, the articles are intended to increase communication and dialogue on issues of common interest related to curriculum. Manuscripts on any contemporary cur riculum issues are welcome. Submissions can be for one article for one particular journal, or they can be for a series of three articles, one for each journal. Submit manuscripts at the appropriate Web site: tcm.msubmit.net, mtms.msubmit.net, or mt.msubmit.net, or contact editors Barbara Reys (reysb@missouri.edu) for TCM, Glenda Lappan (glappan@math.msu.edu) for MTMS, or Chris Hirsch (christian.hirsch@ wmich.edu) for MT. For a perspective on the role and place of standards as a K−12 school improvement strategy, read all three articles in the series.  tThere is never a dull moment in  teaching mathematics to students in the middle grades. Adolescents seem to arrive at school each day with surprising questions and ideas in their developing minds. But the surprises and changes in mathematics teaching are not limited to the students who enter our classrooms. ",6,mtms2009-03-430a,,
"Over the past several decades, the  emergence of electronic tools has transformed the ways that we can engage students in exploring mathematical ideas and solving mathematical problems. Calculators, notebook computers, and cell phones provide instant access to powerful options for numeric, graphic, and symbolic calculation and to resources on the Internet. Those same tools allow students to communicate ideas and questions to teachers and classmates around the world at all hours of the day and night. ",7,mtms2009-03-430a,,
"When electronic information  technologies are applied to the tasks of teaching, they provide intriguing opportunities for transforming the mathematics learning experience. From computer tutors, virtual manipulatives, and SmartBoards to e-books, simulation applets, and computer-adaptive testing, we have access to teaching tools that were hard to imagine in the chalk-and-talk era. Many middle-grades mathematics  classrooms already provide students with an impressive array of technological tools. In some schools, access to tools is the easy part. Figuring out how to use the tools effectively and appropriately is a far greater challenge. If you and your students had full use of existing mathematical and communication tools, how would such tools change— •  the way you teach mathematics in  the middle grades?  •  the way that you assess student  learning?  •  the content of your curriculum?",8,mtms2009-03-430a,,

"In this article, we examine the  questions raised by the emergence of technology-rich mathematics classrooms. Our objective is to stimulate thinking and experimentation by individual teachers, mathematics departments, teacher educators, curriculum and test developers, researchers, and educational policymakers about the need and direction for change in middle-grades mathematics.  technology and MatheMatics teaching",10,mtms2009-03-430a,,
"The mathematical content of the middle-grades curriculum is drawn from the Geometry, Measurement, Data Analysis and Probability, Number and Operations, and Algebra strands. Currently, there are attractive tools for developing key ideas in each of these topic areas.",11,mtms2009-03-430a,,
"Geometry and Measurement This is your objective for one day in a middle-grades mathematics classroom: to develop student understanding of the geometric principle that the area of any triangle can be calculated using the formula A = (1/2)bh. With that goal in mind, you might ask your students to find the largest triangle that can be drawn inside a given rectangle. In time, students will work through a variety of approaches for solving the problem. They may construct physical models, draw pictures, or present an analytical method for making sense of the task. ",12,mtms2009-03-430a,,
"Your challenge is to find ways for students to share and explain their solution strategies. Some teachers have discovered that a document camera, a special video camera designed to display printed and handwritten pages and three-dimensional objects, is an effective tool. A document camera allows students to take turns showing calculations and diagrams that support their reasoning. Different pieces of student work can be displayed to compare and contrast ideas. You can also take pictures of student work to archive for future reference.",13,mtms2009-03-430a,,
"After discussing their initial ideas,  you can direct students to a variety of computer applets for additional exploration or reinforcement of their conjectures. For example, the National Library of Virtual Manipulatives (nlvm.",14,mtms2009-03-430a,,
usu.edu) contains a virtual geoboard that students can use to generate many examples of triangles that are enclosed within a given rectangle. (See fig. 1.),15,mtms2009-03-430a,,
"This exploratory work will probably reveal or confirm the principle that for each rectangular configuration, the area of the largest enclosed triangle is equal to half the area of the original rectangle. Students can then explore the same question with a different applet available on the NCTM’s Illuminations site. (See fig. 2.) This applet allows students to move one vertex of the triangle without changing the height. They will quickly notice that the shape of the triangle changes but ",16,mtms2009-03-430a,,

"that the base, height, and area do not. ",18,mtms2009-03-430a,,
"By combining visual images and  numerical area calculations with some analytic reasoning about the case of right triangles in a rectangle, students are likely to develop a solid understanding of this area formula. At least for triangles with one side along the length or width of the rectangle, they will find the area of the largest inscribed triangle. ",19,mtms2009-03-430a,,
"Data Analysis and Probability Data analysis is an important component of the middle-grades mathematics curriculum (NCTM 2000). When students formulate questions and design research plans, statistical software and interactive whiteboards can be used to collect, display, and analyze the data in new and exciting ways. ",20,mtms2009-03-430a,,
"For example, a middle-grades  mathematics class might be interested in exploring how a cell phone conversation adversely affects response time during a concurrent activity. A number of online tests of reaction time and gaming systems such as Nintendo’s Wii measure response times with millisecond precision. A variety of statistical software packages gives teachers and students the power to analyze the resulting data. Typical data analysis programs generate the summary statistics of mean, median, and range. Generating box plots will allow them to compare data sets  visually. Students can also investigate how sensitive the mean is to outliers; understanding this principle will help students when choosing appropriate measures of central tendency for data. If the computer software is combined with an interactive whiteboard, the possibility of learning while holding students’ attention can be greatly increased. Replacing traditional chalkboards or whiteboards with SmartBoards allows teachers and students to control software programs from both a computer and from the front of the classroom. Thus, the board becomes an interactive focal point of experimentation and discourse about data analysis concepts. This interactive technology can also be applied to classroom investigations in geometry and algebra. ",21,mtms2009-03-430a,,
Number and Operations,22,mtms2009-03-430a,,
"Proportional reasoning is a core subject in the Number and Operations Standards for middle-grades mathematics—the capstone of the elementary school curriculum and the cornerstone of high school mathematics and science (Post, Behr, and Lesh 1988). The importance of ratios and proportions is enhanced by their use in reasoning about similarity of geometric shapes. This visual representation of proportion in, for example, digital photography and computer graphics provides engaging contexts  for student exploration. Imagine a computer display picturing a student standing next to a taller object, such as a climbing wall, and challenging the class to find the height of the wall. Students will probably have intuitive ideas about ways to use the known height of the student to calculate the height of the climbing wall. Then virtual rulers can be used to measure object lengths in pixels, centimeters, or inches. Using several different units of measurement for each object will reveal the invariance of the ratio of the two heights. Photo-editing software allows for easy enlargement or reduction of a picture. If the heights of the two objects are measured after each size-change operation, a scatter plot of the measurement pairs will reveal a linear pattern. A spreadsheet, graphing calculator, or computer line-ofbest-fit analysis will show how to model that pattern with a linear function of the form y = mx. The proportionality relationship expressed in an algebraic form can be used to answer the original question about the height of the climbing wall in a new way.",23,mtms2009-03-430a,,
"Algebra A goal of the middle school mathematics curriculum is to develop students’ skills in, as well as an understanding of, solving linear equations. Computer simulations and calculating tools can be used to provide insight into the concepts and skills involved in that process. ",24,mtms2009-03-430a,,
"For example, one of the most  effective ways of thinking about equations and inequalities is the analogy presented by a simple pan balance. A live demonstration with an actual pan balance might be the best way to start, but a computer simulation can also lead students to discover the operating principles that produce equivalent but simpler equations. Given a virtual pan balance provided by an applet (nlvm.",25,mtms2009-03-430a,,
"usu.edu), students can move unknown  numeric “weights” to see which moves retain balance but lead to a picture revealing the value of x. (See fig. 3.) ",26,mtms2009-03-430a,,
"When students understand the basic  concept of solving equations and have developed an informal strategy, you can then discuss more efficient solution methods. In most computer algebra systems (CAS), once an equation is entered, it is easy to perform an operation on both sides of the equation. The CAS accurately executes the operations asked of it, often showing a result that is different than what students expected. For example, when beginning students are asked to solve for x in 3x + 5 = 17, they often try to incorrectly “divide by 3” or “subtract 2x.” The CAS will show the unhelpful results of those moves. When dividing by 3: ",27,mtms2009-03-430a,,
When subtracting 2x:                   3x + 5 = 17 −2x               − 2x                     x + 5 = 17 − 2x,28,mtms2009-03-430a,,
"Research has shown that when students explore solutions and receive feedback such as that provided by CAS, they quickly develop the understandings and strategic skills that are the desirable goals of instruction.  technology and assessMent oF MatheMatics Knowledge",29,mtms2009-03-430a,,
"In the traditional mathematics classroom, assessing student learning was largely limited to quizzes and tests that provided summative descriptions of knowledge. These summative assessments were used primarily to assign course grades. But the NCTM’s Principles and Standards for School Mathematics states, “Assessment should support the learning of important mathematics and furnish useful infor-",30,mtms2009-03-430a,,
"Fig. 3 Moving unknown “weights” to see what will balance from the NLVM Web site mation to both teachers and students” (NCTM 2000, p. 11). Middle-grades mathematics teachers now have access to innovative technologies that enable them to increase and improve their repertoire of assessment strategies. For example, several computerbased intelligent tutoring systems provide mathematics assessment and instruction that can be customized for individual students. These systems track individual student progress and provide additional instruction in areas of need. The assessment and tutoring systems then communicate diagnostic information to teachers about the performance of individual students or an entire class. ",31,mtms2009-03-430a,,
"Another intriguing assessment  tool is a personal response system. At any point in a lesson, students can be asked to use a remote control “clicker” to respond to a teacher’s multiplechoice question. Software on the teacher’s computer immediately processes student responses and produces summary statistics and charts showing the distribution of student choices among the answer options. Adolescents are often reluctant and uncomfortable when being asked to publicly present their mathematical work. The use of clickers can increase student participation and engagement by providing an anonymous way to assemble student responses to questions. If the results of a question indicate that many students are confused about a topic, teachers can immediately adjust instruction to address the problem. ",32,mtms2009-03-430a,,
"A different form of personal  response technology is provided by devices that allow students to share results of their graphing calculator and computer work. For instance, by scanning submissions of graphs produced to solve an algebra problem, teachers can quickly assess the understandings of many students. They can then select interesting examples of student work to display and analyze in whole-class discussions. By sharing work in this way, teachers gain insight into the knowledge of individual students, and they create powerful opportunities for students to do self-assessment by comparing their own thinking with that of others. ",33,mtms2009-03-430a,,
"Internet technology has opened up other opportunities for teachers to assess student understanding and skill. For example, blogs allow a unique assessment opportunity in that users can interact with one another by posting comments and questions about a theme. At the start of a new unit, the teacher could ask each student to respond to a question by clicking on the comment link of a blog. Then at different points during the unit, students can revisit the blog to rethink their answer to the same question. By scrolling down a page of comments, the teacher can quickly assess the change over time in students’ thinking about a problem. Many teachers are already using ",34,mtms2009-03-430a,,

"The software and graphics capabilities of calculators and computers are particularly well suited to the logical  and algorithmic operations of numeric, graphic, and symbolic calculation essential in mathematical work. Numeric functionality performs exact and approximate arithmetic on whole numbers, fractions, and decimals, as well as irrational and complex numbers. Graphical displays help with analysis of data and functions. These tools also display, measure, and transform geometric figures that satisfy prescribed conditions. Computer algebra systems help solve equations, transform expressions, and test conjectured identities.",37,mtms2009-03-430a,,
"With all these possibilities for technology, these questions come to mind: •  What does this current and emerging access to tools for mathematical work imply about our content goals in mathematics teaching?  •  Is it still important for all middle- grades students to become proficient in the standard computational algorithms of arithmetic?  •  Is it still important for students to  become proficient in the routine algebraic operations on expressions, equations, and inequalities?  •  How is statistical analysis transformed by access to sophisticated data analysis tools?",38,mtms2009-03-430a,,
"Arithmetic in the Future In mathematics classrooms of the precalculator era, a large portion of instructional time was devoted to training all students in procedures for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of whole numbers, common fractions, and decimals and calculations with proportions and percents. Much of the responsibility for developing those skills—especially work involving fractions, decimals, and percents—lay in the middle grades. ",39,mtms2009-03-430a,,
"That said, if students have access to a calculator, the benefits of knowing the calculation algorithms come into question:",40,mtms2009-03-430a,,
Fig. 4 A graph and table showing pricing options  •  Is the important objective to develop student’s estimation strategies and their disposition to question reasonableness of calculator results? Testing reasonableness of arithmetic calculations seldom involves replicating standard algorithms in one’s head or with pencil and paper.  •  How does proficiency with standard  algorithms contribute to the essential problem-solving skill of deciding which arithmetic operations will yield solutions or at least useful information about the problem? ,41,mtms2009-03-430a,,
These are not new questions in mathematics education or in the public discourse about technology and mathematics curricular goals. But the infusion of calculation tools in all aspects of contemporary life makes reconsidering educational objectives a timely discussion.,42,mtms2009-03-430a,,
"Algebra in the Future The case for developing students’ proficiency with arithmetic operations and standard algorithms is often justified by the argument that those skills are essential for success in learning algebra. If one thinks about algebra as a collection of syntactic rules for transforming expressions, equations, and inequalities  into equivalent forms—unaided by tools like spreadsheets, computer algebra systems, and graphing utilities— the importance of skill in generalized arithmetic procedures is obvious. However, once again, almost anyone who needs to operate on algebraic expressions, equations, and inequalities in technical work will have access to tools that make those tasks routine.",43,mtms2009-03-430a,,
"The use of graphing calculators to produce tables and graphs for solving equations and inequalities is widely known and applied. For an example, consider this algebraic problem:",44,mtms2009-03-430a,,
"An amusement park charges $19.95 for individual admissions but offers a group rate of $95.00 plus $13.95 per group member. If a school class is planning an outing to the park, which pricing option is the better choice?",45,mtms2009-03-430a,,
Inspecting tables of values or graphs for the functions I(n) = $19.95n and G(n) = $95.00 + $13.95n shows that the individual price option is the better choice for groups of fifteen or fewer members and that the group option is better for sixteen or more. (See the graph and table in fig. 4.) ,46,mtms2009-03-430a,,
The break-even point for the two pricing options can also be calculated ,47,mtms2009-03-430a,,
Fig. 5 Nutrition information about products in several fast-food establishments by solving the equation $19.95n = $95.00 + $13.95n. The precise solution can be obtained with a CAS by asking it to solve the equation 19.95n = 95.00 + 13.95n. A CAS can do much of the standard algorithmic calculation that consumes instructional time in traditional algebra courses. ,48,mtms2009-03-430a,,
"The availability of computer  algebra tools suggests that we need to question the goals of middle-grades algebra instruction: •  Does focusing instruction on manipulation of symbolic expressions, equations, and inequalities provide students with the most useful algebraic understanding and skill? •  Is there a productive connection  between learning the algebraic skills of manipulating expressions and developing the ability to identify and represent problem conditions in the algebraic forms to which spreadsheet, graphic, and computer algebra system software can be applied?",49,mtms2009-03-430a,,
"Data Analysis and Probability  in the Future In much the same way that calculators and computers raise doubts about curricula that focus on procedural skills in arithmetic and algebra, tools that perform calculations in data analysis and probability suggest rethinking the goals of those important strands in middle-grades mathematics. Widely available statistical software allows students to enter data from many different interesting sources or from their own experiments, calculate summary statistics, and display the data with graphics such as line plots, histograms, box plots, and scatter plots. For example, the screen shot in figure 5 shows how a scatter plot can be used to look for relationships between nutritional attributes of common fast foods.",50,mtms2009-03-430a,,
Probability software can help students to simulate experiments with random processes and to do the combinatorial calculations implied by theoretical analysis of those situations. Tools for data analysis and probability calculations are now available to and used by nearly everyone who needs them for problem solving and decision making. This raises questions about middle school mathematics:  •  How much time should be devoted to developing student skill in statistical calculation and graphing and how much time should be given to interpreting results of those procedures? •  What experiences with paper-andpencil calculations and graphing  are essential as a foundation for understanding basic concepts and the thoughtful use of statistical tools? •  What is the optimal mix of hands- on experiments and simulations in learning basic probability concepts? conclusions,51,mtms2009-03-430a,,
"The calculation and computation tools used by the workforce have been adapted to teach mathematics in the middle grades. Appropriate use of these tools and revising curriculum priorities to reflect how mathematical work is done in a technological environment will require extensive and thoughtful study and experimentation. Given the urgency of providing strong mathematical preparation for students who will enter and live in a technologically sophisticated society and workplace, such study and experimentation by all involved in mathematics teaching should be a high priority.
