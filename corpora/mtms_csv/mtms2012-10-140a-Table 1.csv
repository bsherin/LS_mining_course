"We all remember the Pythagorean theorem:  For any right triangle, the sum of the squares of the sides adjacent to the right angle (the legs) is equal to the square of the side opposite the right angle (the hypotenuse).",3,mtms2012-10-140a,,
"In the traditional symbols, this can be expressed as a2 + b2 = c2, where a and b are the legs and c is the hypotenuse. When a, b, and c are all integers, they are said to form a Pythagorean triple. How many such triples are there, and how can they be found? Most students would know 3, 4, 5. Furthermore, multiplying these lengths by the same integer, one can generate inﬁ nitely many similar right triangles (6, 8, 10), (30, 40, 50), and so on.  operates with squares of numbers, we can use areas to represent them. Let’s put the smaller square on top of the larger, as shown in ﬁ gure 1. The shaded area represents the difference of two squares. If this difference itself is a square number, then we have a Pythagorean triple. Square tiles can be used to construct this design. This way, students can start simply by trying to arrange the tiles that represent the difference into a square. Figure 2 shows the situation when the difference between the two squares (the green tiles) cannot be arranged into a square. In ﬁ gure 3, the difference between the two squares (the green tiles) could form a square, thereby demonstrating the familiar Pythagorean triple: 3, 4, 5.",4,mtms2012-10-140a,,
"Fig. 1 When one square is superimposed on another, the difference of the two squares can be seen in the shaded area.",5,mtms2012-10-140a,,
"Now, let’s alter the original question a little bit: How many Pythagorean triples representing nonsimilar right triangles can an average middle school student name? Most likely, the answer is that very few triples can be named. Some students might remember 5, 12, 13. Memorizing many of these triples would be of limited value. What follows are activities that allow students to discover nonsimilar Pythagorean triples, with the aim of helping them gain insight into this immortal theorem.",6,mtms2012-10-140a,,

"Fig. 4 When taking the difference of two squares, it is helpful to examine the cases where the difference between the side lengths of each square is 1; that is, where b + 1 = c and the difference of the two squares will always be 2b + 1.",11,mtms2012-10-140a,,

SQUARES WITH A SIDE LENGTH DIFFERENCE OF 1,14,mtms2012-10-140a,,
"Using this approach, it may be convenient to classify the Pythagorean triples by the difference (c – b). In other words, we will focus on a particular difference between the hypotenuse and one of the legs, which allows us to ﬁ nd the other leg. Let’s start with the difference of 1.",15,mtms2012-10-140a,,
"In this case, the area of the shaded region in ﬁ gure 1 can be written as 2b + 1. Figure 4 illustrates this particular case. Now, 2b + 1 is a square number if and only if an integer x can be found such that 2b + 1 = x2, in which case x= −2 1",16,mtms2012-10-140a,,
"This tells us that we will be looking for potential differences (c2 – b2) only among odd square numbers, because if x2 is even, b cannot be an integer. For  example, if x = 3, x2 = 9, then b = 4 and c = 5. From this, we see the familiar Pythagorean triple: 3, 4, 5. ",17,mtms2012-10-140a,,
"Now, let’s take x = 5. Then x2 will  equal 25, b will equal 12 from the formula, and c will equal 13 from the Pythagorean theorem. We therefore have another Pythagorean triple: 5, 12, 13. The next one can be found when x = 7, x2 = 49, b = 24, and c = 25. For convenience, we can write them in a table. If generated by hand, we may ﬁ nd the ﬁ rst ﬁ ve rows in table 1. However, these values can be continued indeﬁ nitely using a spreadsheet to create any desired number of such triples.",18,mtms2012-10-140a,,
"Sometimes triangles represented by  these triples are called primitive right triangles. A deﬁ nition accessible to middle school students can be found, for example, in An Adventurer’s Guide  to Number Theory (Friedberg 1994). It is assumed that we are talking about sides that are integers: ",19,mtms2012-10-140a,,
A right triangle is primitive if it is not the same shape as any smaller triangle. (p. 96) ,20,mtms2012-10-140a,,
"Introducing this deﬁ nition may lead to a helpful discussion on similarity of triangles. In light of ﬁ nding Pythagorean triples, it can be emphasized that any triple given in table 1 actually represents a whole class of Pythagorean triples. For example, ",21,mtms2012-10-140a,,

Thus, 10, 24, 26; 25, 60, 65; and 50, 120, 130 are Pythagorean triples, as well. ",25,mtms2012-10-140a,,
SQUARES WITH A SIDE LENGTH DIFFERENCE OF 2,26,mtms2012-10-140a,,
"Let’s consider the case where the square side lengths have a difference of 2. In this case, the area of the shaded region in ﬁ gure 1 can be written as 4b + 4. (See ﬁ g. 5.) Now 4b + 4 is a square number if and only if an integer x can be found such that 4b + 4 = x2, in which case x= −2 4",27,mtms2012-10-140a,,
"This representation tells us that we will be looking for potential differences (c 2 – b 2) only among even square numbers, because if x 2 is odd, b cannot be an integer. For example, if x = 4, x 2 = 16, then b = 3 from the formula above and c = 5 from the Pythagorean theorem. Again, we have the familiar 3, 4, 5. If x = 6, then x 2 = 36, b = 8, and c = 10. A triangle with these sides is similar to the triangle with the sides 3, 4, 5. The next even number (8) produces 8, 15, 17, which is truly a “new triple.”",28,mtms2012-10-140a,,
"For convenience, we can write the triples found into table 2. This table shows the ﬁ rst ﬁ ve odd squares, and these numbers can be continued indeﬁ nitely. Every even line in this table represents a triangle that is similar (with coefﬁ cient 2) to a triangle represented in table 1. For example, the fourth line shows  x = 10, x 2 = 100, b = 24, and c = 26.",29,mtms2012-10-140a,,
"Thus, we have a right triangle with sides 10, 24, and 26. Every side of this triangle is twice as long as the corresponding side of the triangle 5, 12, 13,  which can be found in the second line of the table 1.",30,mtms2012-10-140a,,
This method can be used to create Pythagorean triples with any desired difference between a hypotenuse and a leg. ,31,mtms2012-10-140a,,

"At this point, it may be interesting to consider possible generalizations of the numerical information collected in tables 1 and 2. Let’s start with table 1.",33,mtms2012-10-140a,,
"Every x in this table can be written as 2n + 1, where n is a positive integer. Thus, x 2 = 4n2 + 4n + 1.",34,mtms2012-10-140a,,
"Consequently,  b = 2n 2 + 2n and c = 2n 2 + 2n + 1.",35,mtms2012-10-140a,,
"Therefore, every Pythagorean triple with the difference of 1 between the two greatest numbers can be found by substituting an integer n into these three formulas. For example if n = 17, we have 35, 612, 613.",36,mtms2012-10-140a,,
"Similarly, analyzing table 2, it can  be noticed that x can be written as 2(n + 1), where n is a positive integer. Thus, x 2 = 4n2 + 8n + 4.",37,mtms2012-10-140a,,
"Consequently, b = n2 + 2n and c = n 2 + 2n + 2.",38,mtms2012-10-140a,,
"Therefore, every Pythagorean triple with the difference of 2 between the two greatest numbers can be found by substituting an integer n into these three formulas. For example if n = 17, we have 36, 323, 325.",39,mtms2012-10-140a,,
The method of discovering ,40,mtms2012-10-140a,,
"Pythagorean triples described here is relatively simple. At the same time, it demonstrates for middle-grades  students the power of a systematic approach to a solution. Although it may be rather difﬁ cult to ﬁ nd three numbers with the given property by adding up squares of randomly selected integers in the hope of getting a square number (through a trialand-error method), the suggested approach easily produces inﬁ nitely many triples. In addition, this method emphasizes the strong connections between geometric and algebraic representations. This may help middlegrades students see mathematics in general, as a well-structured system of interconnected ideas.",41,mtms2012-10-140a,,
