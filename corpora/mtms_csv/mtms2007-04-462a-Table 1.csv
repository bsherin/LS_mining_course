"M iddle schoolers are not the easiest  students  to  motivate.  there  are  so many things going on in their lives that often  school  is  valued  more  for  its  social opportunities than for its educational activities. imagine the reactions of your students as they come into your room, hearing guitar music coming from the cd player on your desk. Better yet, imagine that they walk in to see you sitting on a tall stool at the front of the room, strumming a guitar. either way, you have set the stage for an engaging lesson on ratio, proportion, and proportional reasoning.",1,mtms2007-04-462a,,

"and proportion are two topics in the middle school curriculum that are difficult to teach in a meaningful way (cramer and Post 1993; cramer, Post, and currier 1993; lamon 1993; Van de Walle 1994). Yet these topics are critical to students’ mathematical development. nctM’s Principles and Standards for School Mathematics  (2000)  states  that  students  in  grades 6 through 8 should “understand and use ratios and proportions to represent quantitative relationships” and “develop, analyze, and explain methods for solving  problems  involving  proportions”  (p.  214).  research has suggested that the development of proportional  thinking  can  be  enhanced  by  beginning instruction with situations that are meaningful and intriguing to students (lo and Watanabe 1997). this article describes activities that will introduce middle school students to these important concepts in an unusual,  interesting,  and  motivating  way.  Furthermore, if you feel a little insecure about all the music facts and terminology, this activity is a wonderful opportunity to team-teach with a music teacher. ",4,mtms2007-04-462a,,
"What is more important to preteens and early teens than their music? they listen to it, talk about it, and form bands and groups to create it. so it only makes  sense to capitalize on the many connections between music and mathematics. While students study ratios and percent of change, they can play notes on a musical  instrument  to  make  the  relationship  between mathematics and musical pitches come alive. in this article, we will discuss how students can discover a pattern related to the placement of frets on guitars and other chromatic stringed instruments and how they can mathematically determine the fingering positions for different notes on a nonfretted instrument, such  as  a  violin.  in  addition,  they  will  learn  a  little about advanced symbolism (2–1/12)—not normally discussed in middle school—and how to manage such symbols on a calculator. a specific lesson and activity titled “to Fret or not to Fret,” related to this article, is available through nctM’s illuminations Web site at illuminations.nctm.org/lessondetail.aspx?id=U163.",5,mtms2007-04-462a,,

"BeFore  BreakinG  the  MatheMatics  doWn into a fun and dynamic activity for students, we will present  a  brief  technical  explanation.  a  chromatic instrument has available all the notes of a chromatic scale—the  notes  that  correspond  to  all  the  black and  white  keys  of  a  piano.  on  guitars,  mandolins, and banjos, frets are typically positioned so that all the notes of a chromatic scale can be fingered. (in contrast, some instruments such as dulcimers have fewer  frets  and  play  in  a  particular  key,  with  only the  notes  normally  played  in  that  key.)  the  placement of frets on a chromatic instrument is based on a geometric sequence. the length of a string from nut to bridge (see fig.  1) is a starting length, and successive lengths—from the first fret to the bridge, the second fret to the bridge, and so forth—can all be calculated by multiplying each preceding length by 2(–1/12), or approximately 0.94387.

With advance notice, students may want to bring their own instruments from home. otherwise, the music department might be willing to loan instruments for the lesson. if there are not enough stringed musical instruments available from students or the music department, ask another school, a local service organization, or a parent group about borrowing extra instruments. in addition, ask parents and individuals from those organizations to join you for this lesson and to monitor or assist groups using their instruments.",8,mtms2007-04-462a,,

(in a preceding lesson, students might discuss the pros and cons of measuring in inches, centimeters, or millimeters.) First, give each group a fretted instrument  and  have  students  measure  the  length from the nut to the bridge, from the first fret to the bridge,  from  the  second  fret  to  the  bridge,  and  so on, up to at least the twelfth fret, and record all the measurements  as  well  as  the  unit  (see  the  sample data in table 1).

"Fig. 2  Using a calculator to get an approximate decimal value for 2(–1/12), or approximately 0.94387 ratio of the shorter to the longer length and record the data in the table. those ratios turn out to be about 0.94387, or 2(–1/12), no matter which adjacent lengths are divided and regardless of the size of the particular instrument. this is a powerful demonstration of mathematics in music and one that you will want to spend some time discussing with your class. it also highlights three representations of a ratio: as a fraction, a decimal, and in exponential form.  next,  have  students  compare  the  length  of  the string from nut to bridge with the length from the twelfth fret to the bridge. the shorter length should be one-half the longer length, regardless of the size of the instrument. (if this does not hold true on an instrument, the bridge is in the wrong place and the instrument will not play in tune.) in  the  second  activity,  students  determine  the finger  positions  on  a  nonfretted  instrument,  such as  a  violin,  needed  to  play  all  the  notes  of  a  chromatic scale and mark them with a Post-it flag, blue painting  tape,  or  masking  tape.  (actually,  a  larger instrument such as a bass violin would be better for this activity because the tape pieces would not be so close together.) Give each group a nonfretted instrument and the ratio 2(–1/12) ≈ 0.94387. (if students are given the ratio in exponent form, they might need help with the keystrokes to input the number into a  calculator. see fig. 2 for keystrokes to use on a ti-80 or higher calculator. any calculator that displays an entire expression at once will work similarly.)  as  with  the  fretted  instruments,  students  first measure the length from the nut to the bridge and record  that  length.  then  to  calculate  the  length from the bridge to the first finger position, multiply the measured length by 0.94387. Use a narrow strip of tape to mark the first finger position, placing the leading edge of the tape closest to the bridge precisely on that measurement. For each new finger position, students multiply the preceding length (from bridge to finger position) by the same ratio, 2(–1/12). Table 2 contains sample data.

"For algebra students, more accuracy in calculation can be obtained by finding each ar n term of a geometric sequence, where a is the length from nut to bridge, r is 2(–1/12), and n is the particular finger position. algebra students can use the rule of exponents,  (an)m  =  anm,  to  simplify  [2(–1/12)]3  to  2(–3/12) or 2(–1/4),  for  example.  although  the  student  may  not have  studied  fractional  exponents  yet,  the  same rules apply. the middle and right-hand columns in table 2 show that there is little accuracy lost if each new length is obtained by multiplying the previously rounded length by 0.94387, rather than by the calculator approximation of 2(–1/12).",24,mtms2007-04-462a,,

Finger positions are determined with the same geometric ratio of this lesson.",34,mtms2007-04-462a,,
"another extension involves making the sounds of musical notes from twelve water glasses or beakers.
