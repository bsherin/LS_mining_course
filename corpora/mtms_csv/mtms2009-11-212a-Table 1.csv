"Both the qualitative information (student work) and quantitative data (grade-level scores) that we obtained and analyzed from 1998 to 2006 through the Mathematics Assessment Resource Service involved thirty school districts in northern California. Less than 20 percent of the students tested were proficient in establishing an algebraic generalization for figural patterns, such as that in figure 1. By algebraic generalization of a pattern,  we refer to this explanation by Radford (2008, p. 115):   [Students] capability of grasping a commonality noticed on some particulars (in a sequence); extending or generalizing this commonality to all subsequent terms; and being able to use the commonality to provide a direct expression of any term of the sequence. ",4,mtms2009-11-212a,,
"We extend Radford’s (2008) comments to include the necessity of justification at the middle school level. In other words, students have to provide some kind of explanation  that their algebraic generalization is valid by a visual demonstration that provides insights into why they think their generalization is true (cf. Knuth 2002, p. 488). We use the term pattern generalization to convey both mathematical practices of construction and justification of direct formulas. ",5,mtms2009-11-212a,,
"In year 1, a patterning activity was used to strengthen the students’ proficiency with operations on integers and basic equation solving, with a beginning emphasis on increasing patterns. In year 2, a patterning activity was extended to both increasing and decreasing patterns. In year 3, students learned about polynomial expressions and operations, up to multiplication. The patterning activity then focused on the construction of equivalent direct formulas and later provided the context in which to discuss functions and relevant concepts (domain, range, graph) and processes (linear function modeling).

Why do such actions appear to be easier said than done? In addition, pattern generalizing on the basis of three or four initial stages can be problematic. For example, different ways of extending the sequence {1, 2, 4, . . .} would influence the content of the corresponding algebraic generalization.",18,mtms2009-11-212a,,

Take, for example, the prealgebraic mathematical proficiency of Shawna  and Dung, sixth graders in year 1, who are given the pattern in figure 1, and whose responses are in figure 2. Before taking part in a teaching experiment on generalization, they showed basic competence in whole-number operations and relative success in evaluating simple algebraic expressions (e.g., if  a = 2 and b = 3, then 2a + b = ?). When they were asked to write a message that conveyed their generalization for the circles pattern, their generalizations involved words or a combination of words and variables. Although Shawna used words, Dung’s message contained the variable n that made sense only within the context of his entire response.

"A majority of the student-participants in both groups  were Asian Americans; a small number were Caucasian, African American, and Hispanic. We also note that the beginning mathematical proficiency levels of the students in the original group fell under the basic and below categories. In year 3, although all the students were proficient and above in prealgebra, a preassessment clearly showed significant differences in terms of their ability to generalize patterns in favor of the old group. Considering the preassessment findings and anticipating the conceptual requirements of formula construction, the first author and  the grade 8 teacher decided to ground the students’ initial common algebraic experiences on polynomials and polynomial operations, which actually made sense in light of their experiences with integers and integer operations.  table 1 sequence of content in relation to the teaching experiment on patterning and generalization stages",23,mtms2009-11-212a,,

For example, when Shawna, Dung, and Jenna were asked to generalize the same circles pattern at the end of the teaching experiment in year 1, their responses took the form of C = n × 2 – 1, where C refers to the total number of circles and n the stage number. They justified their formula numerically in the context of a table, which they saw as consisting of ordered pairs whose dependent terms consistently increased by two circles. Frank, sixth grader, justified the same formula when he claimed that he saw each stage in the pattern as “doubling a row and minusing a chip,” which we consider to be a type of visual justification.  constRUcting  diRect FoRMUlas",43,mtms2009-11-212a,,
"The initial teaching experiment that helped the year 1 students gain their ability to write direct formulas has been drawn from several algebra units of the Mathematics in Context (MiC) curriculum. For example, in Expressions and Formulas (MiC Development Team 2003), arithmetical operations using arrow strings were investigated. Many contextual problems were solved using arrow strings before any kind of generalization was introduced (see fig. 4). Then students generalized invariant relationships using arrow strings (see fig. 5). ",44,mtms2009-11-212a,,
"Finally, patterns that initially consisted of figural and numerical stages were given, and students were asked to do the following:  1.   Generalize regularities and replace numbers with variables and arrows with the appropriate symbols (operation, equal sign);  2.  Establish and justify visually; and 3.  Establish generalizations numerically. ",45,mtms2009-11-212a,,
"Overall, a careful sequencing and discussion of problems such as those in  figures 4 and 5 helped students move to a formal symbolic representation of linear patterns. ",46,mtms2009-11-212a,,
"In years 1 and 2, the students generalized numerically and visually. In year 2, they learned about the coordinate system that enabled them to make sense of linear patterns graphically. The numerical generalization strategy, which the first group developed in class in year 1, reflected the mathematical practice of common differences. That is, they would initially set up a two-column (or two-row) table. From the table, they would then obtain a common difference among the dependent terms. It conveyed to them the need to set up a direct formula following A = n × B + C, where n represents the stage number in a pattern, A the outcome or total, B the common difference, and C the constant amount needed to completely match the dependent terms. ",47,mtms2009-11-212a,,
"However, we noticed that as  students became more competent in obtaining direct formulas for both increasing and decreasing linear patterns, their ability to justify their formulas weakened over time. Many of them confused justification with construction, using the common difference method. Further, few students could offer different equivalent formulas for the same pattern because the numerical strategy showed them only one route to constructing a direct formula. Among those who consistently generalized visually, construction and justification of a direct expression were seen as mutually related. For example, Frank’s visual perception of the general structure of the circles pattern as involving the “doubling of a row and minusing a chip” was his way of justifying his formula C = n × 2 – 1. ",48,mtms2009-11-212a,,
"In year 3, the first group oriented  the new to the common difference method as described above. Both groups also used a visual grouping approach, which is discussed in some  in Your classroom",49,mtms2009-11-212a,,
"Students benefit from having both visual and numerical modes of generalizing. An effective way of helping them develop both modes is to let them share and critique one another’s generalization strategies. Teachers first need to set up a safe classroom environment in which students are fully aware that they can generate their own solution processes in relation to a task and that sharing their work with others signals ownership of the task. One useful norm that should be frequently discussed in class deals with the possibility that at least one student will always have access to a more sophisticated or a more efficient solution or strategy than the ones that are offered (Rasmussen, Yackel, and King 2003). ",50,mtms2009-11-212a,,
"An interesting way to facilitate the norm discussed above is to show samples of student work, then allow them to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each. For example, students can be asked to analyze the work of other students. Different solutions or strategies can be posted in several parts of the classroom. Students visit each part, take notes, and then share their learning either within the context of a group or the entire class. ",51,mtms2009-11-212a,,
"Closure is an important phase. The teacher should solicit a synthesis of  different approaches and offer a different approach, especially when intended content needs to be shared.",52,mtms2009-11-212a,,
"detail later in this article. At this stage, it is necessary to address the issue of how it is possible to perform pattern generalization on the basis of an incomplete set of particular stages. We accomplish this through Peirce’s (1958) notion of abduction. ",53,mtms2009-11-212a,,
PatteRn assUMPtions,54,mtms2009-11-212a,,
"When we infer something about a phenomenon whose totality we can never fully grasp, we go through two complementary stages that Peirce (1958) refers to as abductive and inductive reasoning. Abductive reasoning involves forming a reasonable hypothesis about the phenomenon. To form that hypothesis, we verify and test the abduced hypothesis several times to see whether it makes sense. When doctors perform an assessment or when jurists analyze a case with incomplete data, the preparatory stage in developing an inference involves abduction. When generalizing a pattern on the basis of a few known initial stages, we need to pay attention to how abduction and induction  can be used together to construct and justify a complete and valid algebraic generalization (Rivera 2008). Following Peirce, abduction as a concept exists and is used only in relation to induction. Thus, a complete pattern generalization involves complementary acts of abduction and induction and, of course, justification. ",55,mtms2009-11-212a,,
"Why Should We Be  Interested in Abduction? Any pattern generalization makes sense but only in the context of an interpreted structure that we initially abduce from the given initial stages. In fact, the extended stages (both near and far generalizations) depend on this necessary abductive step. Induction is used to verify the relevant abduction of the known and extended stages. For example, Shawna, Dung, and Frank abduced linear growth in the case of the circles pattern, whereas Jenna abduced growth in a different way. ",56,mtms2009-11-212a,,
"From this perspective, mathematicians and scientists work the same way. For example, when mathematicians  develop a model of a particular phenomenon, they initially make assumptions or hypotheses (abductions) on the basis of what they know about the phenomenon at the time. Then they test them repeatedly (induction) and prove (using rigorous deductive techniques or a computer verification of an extremely large set of cases). Of course, among middle school students, justification is relative to their level of mathematical experiences. ",57,mtms2009-11-212a,,
"Hence, the first thing we need  our students to consider when they are confronted with a patterning task is how to generate viable, acceptable, and reasonable abductions that could potentially lead to an algebraic generalization that could be justified. From our experiences, multiple abductions could lead to multiple generalizations of the same pattern. The three scaffolding questions below help students develop and articulate a possible abductive structure for any given pattern:  1.  How might you extend this pat- tern? Why extend it that way? 2.  What stays the same and what  changes in your pattern? 3.  Is there another way to extend the  pattern? How so?",58,mtms2009-11-212a,,
"Question 1 provides the necessary initial abductive reflection; question 2 focuses on an explicit articulation of a structure. Question 3 is meant to bring to the surface other plausible, and possibly equivalent, abductive claims. Thus, structure sense and what is eventually generalized are both relative to the abductions they find meaningful to pursue.  geneRaliZing thRoUgh coUnting",59,mtms2009-11-212a,,

",63,mtms2009-11-212a,,
"On the basis of our data, additive thinking in pattern generalization is of two types: •	 Type	1:	Students	initially	formulate	 a surface-based next-to-current relationship, typically expressed in the generic response “add x.”  •	 Type	2:	Students	may	be	so	preoccupied with obtaining the total number of objects per stage number through counting one by one that they fail to notice a possible  structure within a pattern stage or among two or more stages.

"We find specializing to be an effective generalizing strategy. In our study, many students often paid attention to the known individual stages in a pattern one at a time that enabled them to abduce a possible overall structure for the pattern (Mason, Burton, and Stacey 1985). Specializing leads to a local generalization, a way of “seeing the general through the particular.” ",70,mtms2009-11-212a,,
"Analogical reasoning in pattern generalization involves applying the specialized observation obtained in a single stage to the remaining known stages, which then becomes the basis in stating an abduced structure across stages, both known and unknown. For example, the generalizations of Shawna and Dung in figure 2 are results of seeing an analogous-additive relationship among the stages in the circles pattern. Frank’s generalization  of “doubling a row and minusing a chip” reflects an analogous-multiplicative relationship. The scaffolding questions below help students develop an analogical strategy leading to an algebraic generalization:  1.  Focus on the first cue (or any single cue). Describe it for me. Do you see any relationship among the parts of the cue? Do you see any symmetry? Do you see a part of the cue being repeated elsewhere on the cue? 2.  Use what you observed in (1) to analyze the second (or another) cue. Do you notice the same structure? How so?  3.  If what you found in (1) and (2) appear to be consistent, does it apply to the third (or still another) cue? The fourth (or yet another) cue?

Dina, a numerical generalizer, whose work is shown in figure 7c, derives satisfaction and comfort in manipulating numbers with trial and error and other numerical patterning techniques (Becker and Rivera 2005). In our study, we also saw that visual generalizers tend to be adept at using a numerical strategy  (Rivera and Becker 2008), such as Earl, whose work is shown in  figure 7d. Earl initially saw stage 1 as the part that stayed the same from the first stage to the next. When it became difficult for him to establish an algebraic generalization visually, he then employed the common difference strategy leading to the formula 3n + 1 = C, which he verified numerically on two cases and verified visually using stage 2.
