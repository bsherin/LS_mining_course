Math topics addressed: • Geometric transformations • Culturally relevant mathematics • Geometric patterns • Reasoning and sense making 5.  Is dilating a braid strand by 15/16  feasible? Explain what would happen. ,1,mtms2011-04-512a,,
Note: A good resource about hairbraiding patterns is available at http://www.ccd.rpi.edu/Eglash/csdt/ african/CORNROW_CURVES/ index.htm. Students might also be interested in the history and cultural significance of braiding.,2,mtms2011-04-512a,,

Hair Braiding tions used?,5,mtms2011-04-512a,,
"Many students from various ethnic groups have memories of hair braiding. Braiders use geometric transformations, including dilations, rotations, slides, and translations, as well as reasoning to create the patterns in their designs. ",6,mtms2011-04-512a,,
"Questions 1.  Where have you seen transforma- 2.  What is the connection, if any,  between reflections and rotations? 3.  Start with a braid strand, as shown  in the diagram. Explain what would happen to the braid strand if it were translated by (10, 0). What about (−10, 0) and (0, 10)? 4.  Start with another braid strand. What would happen if it were rotated 90 degrees with the origin as the center of rotation?",7,mtms2011-04-512a,,

"solutions to math for real (Continued from page 512) 1.  Answers may vary but may include  tile patterns, quilts, and logos.  2.  If a figure is reflected over two  intersecting lines, it is a rotation. The center of rotation is the point of intersection of the two lines.",9,mtms2011-04-512a,,
"3.  For (10, 0), the braid strand is shifted 10 units to the right.  For (0, −10), the braid strand is shifted 10 units down. For (0, 10), the braid strand is shifted 10 units up.",10,mtms2011-04-512a,,
"4.  To determine what the new braid  strand will look like, draw a line segment from the origin to key points on the braid strand. These points can be rotated by drawing  a new line segment starting at  the origin and rotating them  90 degrees.",11,mtms2011-04-512a,,
"5.  Yes; the dilation is 93.75 percent, and the braid is an adequate size. When you dilate by a number  less than 1, the dilation contracts, or shrinks, the original figure.",12,mtms2011-04-512a,,
For teachers,13,mtms2011-04-512a,,
"Culturally relevant pedagogy (CRP) recognizes that a student’s home culture is not absent from the classroom. It seeks to use that student’s home culture to impart academic skills, knowledge, and attitudes (LadsonBillings 1995). Teachers who employ CRP take the initiative to learn about the community in which they teach. The knowledge gained from observing surroundings, attending community events, talking with students on a casual basis, and doing other research will help create culturally relevant mathematics lessons.

"CURVES/index.htm. This site integrates the mathematical concepts of geometric transformations with the cultural aspect of braiding. It also provides a reading component on the history of braiding. Students are shown various pictures of corn-row braiding that they have to duplicate using various geometric transformations. As students work through recreating the various braiding patterns, teachers can assist them with the reasoning and sense making involved in the mathematics. ",17,mtms2011-04-512a,,
"Use of this site also provides practice with NCTM’s Process Standards of Problem Solving, Communication, Representation, Reasoning and Proofs, and Connections (NCTM 2000). Exploring this site to open the unit will require students to problem solve to determine the effects of their inputs to each field, thus determining which action produces the desired results while developing definitions for these key terms independently. Mathematical communication can be facilitated through sharing the problem-solving strategies used as well as the definitions of various terms. ",18,mtms2011-04-512a,,
