1,Quick Reads: Using Technology to Build a Pen for Browser,"Leigh Haltiwanger, Robert M. Horton, and Brooke Lance us that technology, when used in conjunction with exploration and rigorous questioning, promotes understanding. NCTM (2000) asks us to envision such a classroom in which students delve into mathematics, form and investigate conjectures, draw on knowledge from a wide variety of mathematical topics, and use technology as an essential tool to investigate concepts further. When we effectively teach with technology, all students have opportunities to make sense of topics that might otherwise seem out of their grasp. When we ensure that these things occur in concert, mathematical understanding and sense making are promoted. We presented a problem (see   fig. 1) that, when coupled with the use of a graphing calculator as an exploratory tool, created such an environment for a seventh-grade math class. The problem asked students to think about the relationships among the lengths, widths, perimeters, and areas of possible rectangular pens for a dog named Browser. Students used the Casio PRIZM, a graphing calculator with a color screen, to explore multiple representations and ideas related to domain, range, intercepts, rate of change, and linear and nonlinear functions.

As math teachers, we spend countless hours crafting problems that will energize students and help them connect mathematical topics to their everyday lives. Being successful in our efforts requires that we allow students to explore ideas before we provide explanations and demands that we ask questions to promote a depth of thinking and reasoning that would not occur without such probing (Marshall and Horton 2009).",3,Quick Reads: Using Technology to Build a Pen for Browser

Although wanting students to consider all possible dimensions for the enclosure, we decided to limit dimensions to positive integers so that students could focus more clearly on the relationship between the widths and lengths. The conversation then led to possible minimum and maximum dimensions for the pen, which helped us to consider both the domain and range of the function (see fig. 2). Students struggled somewhat when we began to discuss possible minimum widths for the pen and the longest run we might feasibly create for Browser.",13,Quick Reads: Using Technology to Build a Pen for Browser

Rather than focus on arriving at a correct answer, classroom discourse helped students connect ideas about the domain and range of the function to their prior knowledge and experiences. Students argued about Browser’s size and how much room he would need to be comfortable in his pen. After approximately ten minutes of lively discussion, students agreed to disagree.

19,Quick Reads: Using Technology to Build a Pen for Browser,"Students also realized that there  was a need to organize and track their data. The Casio PRIZM allowed students to quickly generate a list of all possible widths from 0 to 100 feet. After a detailed class discussion that helped students recognize the algebraic relationship between the lengths and widths, l = 200 – 2w, which they had already discussed in building a table of values, they used their calculators to produce a list of all corresponding lengths (see fi g. 3). When analyzing the table, students quickly confi rmed that as the width of the pen increased, the length decreased. ",19,Quick Reads: Using Technology to Build a Pen for Browser
20,Quick Reads: Using Technology to Build a Pen for Browser,"Next, students were asked to  predict what the graph of this relationship would look like. Students verbally made predictions and used their calculators to compare the actual graph to their predictions and to the table they generated. The speed and  accuracy of the graphing calculator allowed students to focus their discussion on the meaning of the intercepts and rate of change and how these ideas connected to their original drawings of Browser’s pen (see fi gs. 4 and 5). Students realized that the y-intercept represented a pen with a width of zero and a length of 200. Conversely, they recognized that the x-intercept represented a pen with a width of 100 and a length of 0. Students seemed to fully understand that both sets of dimensions would not make a realistic pen. ",20,Quick Reads: Using Technology to Build a Pen for Browser
21,Quick Reads: Using Technology to Build a Pen for Browser,"In analyzing the graph, students observed that as the width increased by one unit, the length decreased by two units.
