4,Parts of a Parallelogram - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The submissions that we received indicated that middle-grades students could provide reasoning through patterning and informal proofs. Walter Stark’s sixth-grade students tended to attack the problem by creating a specific parallelogram using friendly numbers for the height and base, so that they could calculate actual areas of each piece. After some discussion, the class decided to investigate a parallelogram with a base of 8 and a height of 6 to avoid fractions in the measurements for the various triangles. Students also decided that drawing the parallelogram on grid paper might make the lengths and areas easier to see.",,
5,Parts of a Parallelogram - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Camila’s work on question 1 shows this strategy clearly (see fig. 1). She drew the parallelogram, labeled it, and then calculated the areas of the triangles and compared them.",,
6,Parts of a Parallelogram - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Isabella then explained how these steps helped her calculate the other areas (see fig. 2). She knew that the diagonal cut the parallelogram into two congruent pieces; she then used the areas she found in the first question to figure out the rest.,,
7,Parts of a Parallelogram - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Stark recognized that his students had answered the questions for a specific parallelogram only, not for all parallelograms. Therefore, for homework, he asked them to decide if the ratios and fractions would be the same or different for other parallelograms and to justify their answer. Most of his sixth-grade students believed that they would be the same for all parallelograms, but they had trouble with the justification. Many attempted to use several more examples and find the actual areas, but they ran into difficulties when the height and base lengths resulted in fractional or decimal values. Their use of the grid paper and reliance on counting lengths did not help them. For example, Johnny provided a drawing and justification (see fig. 3).",,
8,Parts of a Parallelogram - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"His estimate of the heights of triangle EFB and triangle CFD in terms of halves (3.5, 6.5) rather than thirds (3.33, 6.67) left him with fractional amounts that did not result in equivalent fractions. He compared their decimal values and found that they were close in value, so if he rounded, they were the same. He realized that the fractions on his square were not exact, so neither were his answers.",,
9,Parts of a Parallelogram - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We can see the difference between the reasoning of these sixth graders and that of Fatima Habash’s eighth graders. Neha and Abhinav both started with the generalized version and worked with their more advanced knowledge about properties of parallelograms and similar triangles. Both students recognized that ΔDFC and ΔEFB were similar triangles because corresponding angles were congruent. They used the idea that alternate interior angles are congruent when parallel lines are cut with a transversal and the fact that vertical angles are congruent. In similar triangles, corresponding sides are proportional, which would also make the heights proportional. Therefore, the students concluded that the base and height of ΔDFC would be twice the length of the base and height of ΔEFB. Neha then concluded that the area would be in a ratio 4:1 (see fig. 4). Although the idea is correct, the student seemed to have either used sides lengths as the height or assumed that the angles at F are right angles.",,
10,Parts of a Parallelogram - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Neha’s thinking was unclear. Abhinav also ran into difficulties at this point in his generalization. He used similar reasoning for the triangles being congruent, redrawing them in the same orientation, but then stopped short of explaining why the areas would be in a ratio of 1:4 in general terms. Instead, Abhinav reverted to the specific properties of the given parallelogram and measured the height of the parallelogram as 9 cm and the base as 8 cm. This resulted in the area calculations and ratios shown in  figure 5.",,
11,Parts of a Parallelogram - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The student work indicated that they could explore the situation and reach a conclusion about the parts of the parallelogram. However, most of these students were still relying on a few specific examples to justify their conclusions, which is common at the middle school level. As teachers, we need to be cognizant that examples do not justify conclusions. Examples only lead toward more formal ideas of proof if we can generalize about what is the same and what changes as we examine the different parallelograms. The sixth graders were still struggling with this notion. Matthew tried two more parallelograms, one 6 × 10 and one 6 × 6. He concluded that the fractions and ratios of the pieces would all be the same, regardless of the size of the parallelogram. His explanation is shown in figure 6.",,
12,Parts of a Parallelogram - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Matthew’s reasoning shows that he has started to generalize, but he does not extend it to odd lengths because he could not be precise with his estimates on the grid paper. Gabriella, another sixth grader in Stark’s class, also had difficulties with the odd heights and estimated the heights of the triangles in terms of halves, similar to the work that Johnny displayed. However, based on her work and class discussions, she decided that all the fractions should be equivalent, if they could be measured precisely:",,
13,Parts of a Parallelogram - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,It is all the same because the fractions [of the parts of the parallelogram] are equivalent. They are equivalent because you do the same formula and work for each figure that you do.,,
14,Parts of a Parallelogram - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"She has the idea that we are doing the same processes, based on the length and height of any parallelogram, so she appears to be on the verge of understanding the concepts of generalization. The major stumbling block for these sixth graders was the lack of understanding of the height being in the same ratio as the sides and relying on counting distances on grid paper.",,
15,Parts of a Parallelogram - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"These difficulties may have been overcome if students could have used dynamic geometric software to explore the relationships between lengths and areas. We believe this activity would have been an excellent place to use technology, thereby allowing students to explore a large number of examples and develop generalizations. In so doing, they could then begin to justify their results in ways that would lead toward more formal notions of proof in subsequent years.",,
16,Parts of a Parallelogram - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,We would like to thank the teachers and their students who sent us student work and their reflections regarding this task. The teachers and schools were the following:,,
17,Parts of a Parallelogram - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Without teachers who are willing to share their use of the task and their students’ work with MTMS readers, we would not be able to provide the readers with actual samples of middle school student strategies and work that provides insight into the thinking of middle school students.",,
