6,"Book, Product, _ Software Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Its Elementary: A Parents Guide to Mathematics is a detailed and easily digestible resource for K5 parents looking to gain a greater understanding of current instructional practices in math and to learn how best they can support their students development as math students. The book posits four key principles that weave their way through chapters on such topics as number sense, fractions, and whole-number operations.",,
7,"Book, Product, _ Software Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Two of those principles deal with todays math classroom and the need for parents to understand its expectations as well as how it differs from the math classroom that they remember. The first two chapters, focused on those principles, provide a valuable primer for parents who are struggling to make sense of recent changes in math instruction. The other two principles express that parents must understand students work to grasp their deep mathematical thinking and that students must make connections across mathematical concepts to truly comprehend the subject. Numerous examples and discussions of student work in each chapter make it easy for parents to see the truth in these ideas.",,
8,"Book, Product, _ Software Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Modern math instruction and the Common Core have been pilloried in recent years for defying logic or making the simple seem complicated. This book, through patient and detailed exploration of the hows and whys of current instructional strategies, offers parents the opportunity to cut through much of that noise. This is a great resource for teachers to recommend to parents who are especially curious or concerned about math.",,

15,"Book, Product, _ Software Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Beyond Invert & Multiply is a highly awaited sequel to Julie McNamaras Beyond Pizzas & Pies. McNamaras first volume explained how to present a basic knowledge of fractions; Beyond Invert & Multiply continues with how to make sense of fraction computation and operations, presenting a research-based approach to fraction computation through classroom scenarios, classroom activities, reproducibles, and study questions. The volume does this in a multimedia learning resource while explaining the math and the research each step of the way. Video clips, including actual classroom scenarios, vividly enhance these extremely challenging math topics. The accompanying DVD has more than 30 video clips, and the author gives a clip-by-clip commentary of reflections near the end of the book.",,
16,"Book, Product, _ Software Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Although teaching fraction computation may seem daunting to many of us classroom teachers, Beyond Invert & Multiply presents the overall concept in easy-to-understand, bite-size chunks. The book also makes connections to the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics.",,
17,"Book, Product, _ Software Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Teachers will appreciate the connections made to readily available, common mathematics manipulatives that most of us already have in the classroom, such as Cuisenaire Rods. I especially appreciate the way the lessons are intended to get students much more involved than simply answering questions. The video clips are also a wonderful way to see how lessons may be implemented in the classroom.",,

24,"Book, Product, _ Software Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Challenging Math Problems presents some fun and highly formidable math problems and puzzles from noted puzzle creator Terry Stickels, who has been creating math and word puzzles for years. As he notes in the introduction, this is a collection he has been working on for more than eight years. Stickelss best-known puzzles are probably Frame Games and Stickelers, both published nationally. Checking my personal math library, I found the name Terry Stickels on several books, such as Math Puzzles and Brainteasers, Grades 68.",,
25,"Book, Product, _ Software Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Challenging Math Problems presents 101 problems with well-explained answers. The problems are presented in no particular order, but all give that aha! moment of extreme satisfaction if you manage to get the correct answer. Another important point is that these problems require no higher math, just excellent thinking skills. Here are some examples:",,

34,"Book, Product, _ Software Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","This book is appropriate for students in grades 47. It has light musical and mathematical connections. According to the author, it is meant for piano students needing some inspiration to continue their practice to become better musicians.",,
35,"Book, Product, _ Software Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Ghost in the Key of A: Pythagoras is a quick, light story with a female character who bravely overcomes struggles. With an introductory connection between mathematics and music, the book has mild potential for a cursory interdisciplinary study of the two in a school setting, but it is more appropriate for music teachers or piano instructors. The book falls short of being a math and music story, so teachers will be disappointed if they are looking to fuse the two. Pythagoras is a minor character who is involved superficially, connecting math and music through fractions only. The book only mildly brings the music, fractions, and father-daughter relationship to a conclusion.",,
36,"Book, Product, _ Software Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","I do not recommend this book for teachers of either math or music. I rooted for Priscilla and was hoping Pythagoras would reveal more truths and insights, but it did not happen for me.",,

42,"Book, Product, _ Software Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","In this user-friendly guide for modeling in the middle school mathematics classroom, Nancy Butler Wolf writes with a teachers voice that is easy to comprehend. She challenges the notion that students must master a procedural skill before applying it. The first chapter plainly explains mathematical modeling and how it benefits students. In the second chapter, the author describes characteristics of rich mathematical modeling tasks and how to find them. The subsequent chapters guide teachers through the phases of modeling with mathematics: Investigation and Problem Identification; Formulating the Model, Collecting Data, and Finding a Solution; Interpreting the Solution and Comparing with Reality; and Communicating and Implementing the Solution. Finally, Wolf discusses how she uses tasks as assessment.",,
43,"Book, Product, _ Software Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","The work is strengthened because of its narrow focus on the middle grades. It is full of examples of different tasks in each chapter, including student vignettes and samples of student work, all applicable to the middle-grades math teacher. Thus, readers come away with a collection of tasks appropriate for their classroom.",,
44,"Book, Product, _ Software Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","One task, in particular, is woven through the entire book: Students are asked to create 1000 paper origami cranes that will be strung together for a school display. They must predict how much time it will take them and how much space they will need for the  display. Further, they must be able to present the results to their principal. The author does a nice job of connecting every phase of modeling to this task.",,

50,"Book, Product, _ Software Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","This product contains designs created by mathematical patterns, which can then be colored by the reader. The purpose is to show the beauty that can be created by mathematical shapes, patterns, and randomness.",,
51,"Book, Product, _ Software Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics",The strengths of the book include the following: (1) Designs are grouped according to foundational pattern; (2) historical facts about the creator are included when available; (3) explanations about the mechanics of the design are provided; and (4) the creation pages are excellent.,,
52,"Book, Product, _ Software Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics",The book has only a couple of weaknesses: (1) The notations behind the designs are extremely short; and (2) the focus is more on coloring the design and not the mathematics behind it.,,
53,"Book, Product, _ Software Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","This material is best suited for high school students. My students, in eighth-grade math and seventh-grade prealgebra, were not very interested in the history of the design; they only wanted to color. I used Galtons Quincunx when we discussed randomness. They understood randomness but quickly lost interest in completing the design because it took too much time and effort. For middle school, it probably would have been just as effective if the dots had been larger and spacing was a little wider.",,
