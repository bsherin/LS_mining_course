"An understanding of fractions is foundational to proportional reasoning and algebra (Lamon 2005). For example, a direct-variation relationship may include a constant of proportionality that is rational, and linear equations may have solutions that are fractions. Beyond that, a grasp of the concept of proportionality and of rational numbers is necessary for understanding other topics, such as rational functions, algebraic fractions, scaling, and similarity (Thompson and Bush 2003). Given the need to address students’ weak understanding of fractions and the lack of time to cover all the prescribed content in a first-year algebra course, what follows is a method for helping students develop a deeper understanding of fractions ",7,mtms2010-08-34a,,

the Value oF the sloPe ratio,11,mtms2010-08-34a,,
"One particularly important type of ratio is slope (Smith 2002). Given a line that passes through (0, 0) and (x, y), the ratio of every y-coordinate to its corresponding x-coordinate belongs in the same equivalence class of ratios (Lamon 2005). Thus, if the slope of a line is used to represent a fraction such as 3/4, then every point on that line passing through (0, 0) and (4, 3) represents a fraction that is equivalent to 3/4 (see fi g. 1). In  other words, the slope of a line can be used to represent a fraction simply by using the “rise” as the numerator and the “run” as the denominator, and the entire set of points that are on the line can illustrate the equivalence class of that fraction (Arnon, Nesher, and Nirenburg 2001).",12,mtms2010-08-34a,,
"Using graphs of lines to illustrate  equivalent classes of fractions (Arnon, Nesher, and Nirenburg 2001; Lamon 2005), ninth-grade students explored fraction equivalence while they investigated the concept of slope. The students began with a printed coordinate grid similar to Anderson’s (2003), on which fractions were represented as slopes, with the y-coordinate  representing the numerator and the x-coordinate representing the denominator. To represent fractions as y/x, the origin was used as the starting point so that the slope would be (y – 0)/(x – 0). The graph was also restricted to the fi rst quadrant so that students could focus on positive fractions. ",13,mtms2010-08-34a,,
"To begin, students explored an  equivalence class of fractions by plotting a set of fractions (again, the xcoordinate was the denominator, and the y-coordinate was the numerator). They quickly discovered that these fractions appeared to lie on the same line and that they all simplifi ed to the same fraction. This helped them see that many fractions could represent a single rational number. They were also able to discover how the slope of the line connecting any two points was the same as that single rational number.",14,mtms2010-08-34a,,
"Density of Rational Numbers The use of lines graphed on a coordinate plane illustrates that between two rational numbers are infi nitely more rational numbers. This is normally a diffi cult and abstract concept for students who do not recognize that a fraction can be a single number (Arnon, Nesher, and Nirenburg 2001). However, if two lines starting at the origin with different slopes represent different fractions, students can see that an infi nite number of lines can be drawn between the two lines representing fractions between the other two. In other words, there can be an infi nite number of lines with slopes between 0 and 1 (or between any two lines with different slopes). This represents an important step toward a deeper understanding of rational numbers.",15,mtms2010-08-34a,,
Comparing Fractions,16,mtms2010-08-34a,,
"Representing fractions as slopes of lines visually demonstrates the relationship between different fractions. When using other representations of  fractions, determining which of two fractions is greater cannot be readily found without fi rst fi nding common denominators or converting to decimals. For example, the relationship between 10/13 and 7/9 may not be apparent using a pie chart. Students may also draw a wrong conclusion when thinking that 10/13 > 7/9 by using an area model (see fi g. 2). ",17,mtms2010-08-34a,,
"However, when using slopes to represent fractions, steeper lines represent greater fractions. Thus, students can easily see that 3/4 is greater than 1/2 because a line with a slope of 3/4 is clearly steeper than a line with a slope of 1/2 (see fi g. 3). At the same time, students are able to see how changes to the numerator or denominator affect the slope. For example, when two fractions have the same numerator, the one with the greater denominator has a lower value for slope. This is useful in convincing students that smaller denominators generate larger fractions when the numerators are held constant (e.g., 1/3 > 1/4 > 1/5 > . . .).",18,mtms2010-08-34a,,
Operations with Fractions,19,mtms2010-08-34a,,
"The use of slopes to represent fractions can also provide a way to compute sums, differences, products, and quotients of fractions. To show students how this worked, I gave them dry-erasable colored markers, rulers, and a blank coordinate graph placed in a plastic sheet protector (so they could reuse the graph for a variety of problems). As they practiced working with slopes, they were able to develop a deeper understanding of fractions and enhance their skills working with fraction operations. The following sections show how to use slopes for addition, subtraction, and multiplication of fractions.",20,mtms2010-08-34a,,

"For example,  would require students to graph two  lines through (0, 0), one with a slope of 3/4 and the other with a slope of 2/5 (see fi g. 4). As students extend these lines by practicing “rise over run,” they will notice that the lines go through  low-tech tools can help students perform operations with fractions while enforcing the concept of slope.",24,mtms2010-08-34a,,
"a set of lattice points (i.e., points with integer coordinates). For example, the fraction 3/4 would “rise 3 and run 4” from (4, 3) to (8, 6) to (12, 9) and so on. They can then add where the lattice points of two lines align vertically, for example, at x = 20. This is analogous to fi nding the common denominator because the lattice points will line up vertically at common multiples of 4 and 5. The sum of the numerators is simply the sum of the y-coordinates when the x-coordinates are the same. Thus,  is 15 8 20 (see fi g. 4). Similarly, the difference between two fractions can easily be  seen as the difference between the y-coordinates (see fi g. 4). Thus,  is 15 8 20",25,mtms2010-08-34a,,
"Using slopes to perform addition and subtraction is a powerful way to reinforce the meaning of the common denominator. Students are often confused when they are asked to multiply each denominator by the other. They may also think incorrectly that such a process changes the fraction into a different fraction. However, the graph clearly illustrates that points along the same line represent the same fraction and that multiplying one denominator ",26,mtms2010-08-34a,,

MultiPlYing Fractions using sloPe,31,mtms2010-08-34a,,
"Although multiplying fractions is generally less diffi cult for students than adding or subtracting fractions, the slope model provides an algorithm. For example, 2/3 ×  2/5 could be viewed as being 2/3 of 2/5 (Siebert and Gaskin 2006), which could then be represented using lines with slopes of 2/3 and 2/5, respectively. As with addition and subtraction, the denominator is simply the x-value where the lattice points of the two lines align vertically (e.g., x = 15). Determining the numerator of the answer for 2/3 × 2/5 means fi nding 2/3 of the y-coordinate of the line that has a slope of 2/5 (at x = 15), or 2/3 of 6 (see fi g. 5).

Since (2/3 × 6) = 4, the answer to the multiplication question would be 4/15. At the same time, the commutative property of multiplication could also be illustrated by fi nding 2/5 of 2/3:  =• =• =    10 15 • • • • • • • • 10 10• 10 •10 10 •10   15 15 • • •  ",32,mtms2010-08-34a,,
"This display illustrates that fi nding the numerator is the same as fi nding 2/5 of 10 (the y-coordinate of the line, with slope 2/3 at x = 15).",33,mtms2010-08-34a,,
diViding Fractions using sloPe,34,mtms2010-08-34a,,
"Students are often confused with dividing fractions because they do not apply the invert-and-multiply algorithm correctly. One alternative is to think of fraction division as a ratio of two fractions. Usiskin (2007), for example, has suggested thinking of division as a ratio. Thus, when using slopes to represent fractions, students simply need to consider the ratio of the two y-values at the lattice points where the x-values are the same. For the example of  2/3 ÷ 2/5, the lattice points line up at x = 15, where the y-values are 10 and 6, so we fi nd the ratio of 10 to 6, or 10/6 (see fi g. 5), which can then be simplifi ed by fi nding lattice points on the line between (6, 10) and (0, 0). Division can be performed by taking the ratio of the two y-coordinates because when the lattice points are aligned vertically (e.g., at x = 15), the two fractions have the same denominator. So 2/3 ÷  2/5 becomes 10/15 ÷ 6/15, or 10/6.",35,mtms2010-08-34a,,
considerations For the classrooM,36,mtms2010-08-34a,,
The slope representation of fractions was taught to a group of ninth graders  coMMon Fraction Models,37,mtms2010-08-34a,,
"In elementary school and middle school textbooks, the three most common models for illustrating fractions, as described in watanabe (2002), are—  •  the linear model (e.g., a number line); •  the area model (e.g., a pie graph or a rectangular area); and •  the discrete model (e.g., a set of objects).  teachers use these representations, then employ a variety of methods to help students understand fractions and fraction operations. For example, watanabe (2002) advocates the use of a ratio method that compares the fractional part to the whole. Siebert and Gaskin (2006) suggest that partitioning and iterating are more effective ways to illustrate the meaning of fractions and fraction operations. In their approach, 3/4 means 3 iterations of 1/4, which is obtained by partitioning a whole into fourths. perhaps the most common approach to teaching the concept of fractions is through part-whole representations, which can be illustrated by viewing slices of a pie or by counting some number out of a total set of objects.  these approaches may continue to cause difﬁ culty because students must  consider the fractional part while keeping the whole in mind (watanabe 2002; wong and evans 2007). other students may never recognize the fraction when they encounter, for example, a shaded slice of a pie or a picture with three colored circles and one noncolored circle (Siebert and Gaskin 2006). ",38,mtms2010-08-34a,,
"Further, it has been argued that the part-whole representation does not  adequately help students transition to a robust understanding of the various possible interpretations of fractions and the connections between them (lamon 2005). For example, fractions can also be seen as an “operator” (i.e., a multiplicative factor) or as a quotient (e.g., 3 candy bars divided among 4 persons, with each getting 3/4) (wong and evans 2007). ",39,mtms2010-08-34a,,
"In particular, Usiskin (2007) points out the need to use rates and ratios,  which can help students understand that a fraction is a single rational number, not merely two whole numbers separated by a fraction bar. this knowledge can help students recognize the multitude of fractions that belong to an equivalence class of a single rational number. Students who have not developed an understanding of an equivalence class of fractions tend to have difﬁ culties working with fractions (Arnon, Nesher, and Nirenburg 2001).",40,mtms2010-08-34a,,
"Modeling an equivalence class of fractions is often difﬁ cult because of the limitations of various representations. For example, partitioning a portion of a pie into smaller slices does not necessarily convince a student that the resulting fractions are equivalent. After all, the newly partitioned slices are indeed smaller. Using colored chips may be even more unconvincing, for example, because 30 chips (out of 40) are clearly more than 3 chips (out of 4), although the ratios are the same. In fact, all part-whole models do not clearly represent many fractions from an equivalence class simultaneously. However, using rates and ratios, as Usiskin (2007) suggests, can help illustrate an entire equivalence class of fractions because, for example, the rate of travel is the same whether traveling 50 miles in one hour or 100 miles in two hours.",41,mtms2010-08-34a,,
"who were repeating fi rst-year algebra. After teaching the lessons, I realized that several additional concerns needed to be addressed.  1. When multiplying fractions whose denominators share common factors,  the answer obtained from the lattice points where the x-coordinates are aligned vertically will not be in simplest terms. This will be evident because the coordinate pair representing that fraction is not the closest lattice point to (0, 0). To simplify the fraction, a student  can locate the lattice point that is closest to the origin on the line passing through a coordinate pair that represents the fraction. For example, in figure 1, (8, 6) represents the fraction 6/8, which simplifies to 3/4 because (4, 3) is the closest lattice point to the origin.",42,mtms2010-08-34a,,
"2. Plotting y/x from these activities may be difficult because students are accustomed to seeing horizontal tables where the x-values are placed along the top row and the y-values are on the bottom row. This knowledge might interfere with their proper plotting of points. In fact, when I taught this lesson for the first time, many students initially plotted x/y, which is also a common error when working with slope ratios. This error can be addressed by asking students to notice that 3/4, for example, is less than 4/4 (or 1), whereas 4/3 is greater than 4/4 (or 1). Thus, students can see that plotting x/y results in graphing a line that does not match the correct relationship to the number 1, which is represented by the line y = x. By using this visual approach, students can gain a conceptual understanding of why the inverted fraction yields an incorrect slope.",43,mtms2010-08-34a,,
"3. I found that some students may engage in slope activities mechanically without truly understanding or making the connection to fractions. For example, some students did not immediately recognize that fractions represented by lattice points along the same line also had the same slope. Therefore, students needed to be prompted to determine the slope between various lattice points so that they could see how the slope remains the same for any two points on the line. This is useful not only for deepening an understanding of equivalent fractions but also for helping students gain a conceptual understanding of slope relationships.  4. Some students had trouble counting correctly, which caused them to plot points that were not on the same line of slope. Thus, teachers must be careful when monitoring student progress to ensure the accuracy of their graphs. Students may also resist this new approach because they resent having to learn something different. However, when lessons are presented as “slope activities,” these students may become less resistant. The key is to give students the opportunity to explore the relationships and make the connections with familiar algorithms. Thus, the lesson must be structured so that using slope to perform fraction operations does not become yet another mindless algorithm.",44,mtms2010-08-34a,,
conclusion,45,mtms2010-08-34a,,
"Teaching fractions through slopes can help students develop a richer understanding of both. For example, when lattice points of two lines with different slopes are vertically aligned, the x-value of the lattice provides a common denominator for the fractions being added. This allows students to develop conceptual understandings that are directly connected to traditional procedures, such as the rationale for finding common denominators. In fact, this approach provides a powerful picture of what common multiples look like.",46,mtms2010-08-34a,,
"Further, adding the y-coordinates of the lattice points allows students to see that the sum of positive fractions results in fractions being represented by steeper slopes. For example, 3/4 + 2/5 produces a fraction that is represented by a line with a slope of 23/20, which is steeper than either of the addends.",47,mtms2010-08-34a,,
"Many students also have the misconception that products are always greater than factors. Using slopes to represent fractions allows students to see cases in which the products are not greater than the factors. In fact, the use of slopes can illustrate  cases when products are greater than 1, equal to 1, or less than 1. Finally, using this approach can also enhance proportional reasoning, which is an important part of secondary mathematics (Thompson and Bush 2003). ",48,mtms2010-08-34a,,
"Fluency with basic operations is one of the five essential components of mathematical proficiency (Kilpatrick, Swafford, and Findell 2001). Using the slopes representation allows students to develop this fluency as part of their work in algebra. ",49,mtms2010-08-34a,,
"By visualizing fractions as slopes,  students are able to maintain a pictorial representation of difficult and abstract concepts such as equivalent classes of fractions and the density of fractions (Arnon, Nesher, and Nirenburg 2001). This helps to free students’ mental space for thinking and allow them to focus on the actual operations. At the same time, working with slopes can help students develop a deeper conceptual understanding of fractions that is not possible with other fraction models. Using slopes as fractions provides opportunities for students to practice working with fractions at the same time that they are working with the concept of slope. As a result, students are given the opportunity to learn the difficult concept of fractions creatively.",50,mtms2010-08-34a,,
