9,How Many Zeroes at the End_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1),"This Solve It task originally appeared in the April 2016 issue. We hoped the task would have students consider aspects of number theory to make and test conjectures regarding numbers that end in zero. We also hoped that they would be able to predict how many zeroes would occur in the product of several numbers without actually multiplying the factors. Jennifer Marshall of Levi P. Dodge Middle School in Farmington, Minnesota, submitted her students’ work. In this Solve It Student Thinking, Marshall reflects on how she used the task:",,
10,How Many Zeroes at the End_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1),"I gave this problem to sixth- and seventh-grade students who have varying levels of mathematical understanding. When introducing the problem, students were asked to consider what the following four numbers have in common: 100; 40; 350; and 12,000. Many students were easily able to identify that all four of the numbers ended in a zero. Typically, students then explained how all of the numbers are multiples of 2 and 10. However, many students needed prompting to identify another factor that all four of these numbers had in common (namely, 5). Isabella verified the fact that all four of the numbers are divisible by 5 by carrying out each calculation (see fig. 1).",,
11,How Many Zeroes at the End_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1),,,
12,How Many Zeroes at the End_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1),"With these ideas in mind, students were asked how they knew that all these numbers were multiples of 10. This question prompted students to connect their initial observation that all four of the numbers ended in zero with the fact that all four were multiples of 10. Some students began to recognize that if a number was a multiple of 10, then it must have factors of 2 and 5. Some students were still unconvinced that multiples of 10 always had factors of 2 and 5. To try to convince students of this fact, I used the following sequence of statements:",,
13,How Many Zeroes at the End_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1),True or false: 23 × 10 will end in a zero.,,
14,How Many Zeroes at the End_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1),True or false: 23 × 2 × 5 will end in a zero.,,
15,How Many Zeroes at the End_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1),True or false: 23 × 5 × 2 will end in a zero.,,
16,How Many Zeroes at the End_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1),True or false: 2 × 23 × 5 will end in a zero.,,
17,How Many Zeroes at the End_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1),"Some students also had difficulty recognizing that if one number had a factor of 5 and another number had a factor of 2, then the product of those numbers would be a multiple of 10 (and therefore would end in a zero). To build this understanding, the following sequence was used:",,
18,How Many Zeroes at the End_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1),True or false: 15 × 8 will end in a zero.,,
19,How Many Zeroes at the End_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1),True or false: 3 × 5 × 8 is equal to 15 × 8.,,
20,How Many Zeroes at the End_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1),True or false: 3 × 5 × 2 × 4 is equal to 15 × 8.,,
21,How Many Zeroes at the End_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1),True or false: 3 × 5 × 2 × 4 will end in a zero.,,
22,How Many Zeroes at the End_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1),True or false: 15 × 8 will end in a zero.,,
23,How Many Zeroes at the End_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1),"Once students understood that zeroes at the end of a number were the result of multiplying a factor of 2 by a factor of 5, they proceeded with the first problem. Students generally took one of two approaches with this first problem. Some students made factor trees to systematically identify all the prime factors for each number. These students then counted how many factors of 2 and 5 there were for each number in the calculation. Isabella and Faith found eleven factors of 2 and three factors of 5 using this method (see fig. 2).",,
24,How Many Zeroes at the End_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1),,,
25,How Many Zeroes at the End_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1),"Other students wanted to find a more efficient method to answer the question, so they only looked for factor pairs of 2 and 5. Brandon and Bethany’s work exemplifies this approach to answering the first question (see fig. 3). Regardless of the method used, students like Faith were able to summarize that “There are 3 combinations of 5 × 2 = 10. That makes 3 zeroes.” (Above Bethany’s circled products, you can see where she counted the number of zeroes at the end of the product.)",,
26,How Many Zeroes at the End_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1),,,
27,How Many Zeroes at the End_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1),"Students generally took similar approaches when predicting how many zeroes would be at the end of the various products in the second problem. Some students made factor trees for all numbers, whereas other students looked for pairs of 5 and 2 exclusively. Question 2(c) (“Predict how many zeroes will be at the end of 200 × 201 × 202 × … × 230”) presented an interesting challenge for students. This problem often forced students to recognize patterns from the previous examples, so that they could work more efficiently with a larger set of numbers. Connor and Nathaniel made factor trees for multiples of 5 only (see fig. 4). When asked why they skipped other numbers, they articulated that all the even numbers would have factors of 2, and there were clearly more than 9 even numbers. Therefore, since factors of 5 occurred less frequently than factors of 2 in the given numbers, they only needed to find factors of 5 to predict how many zeroes would be at the end of the product. All even numbers in this set would have factors of 2, and there were more even numbers than factors of 5 in all the given numbers.",,

29,How Many Zeroes at the End_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1),"As an extension question, students were asked to create a sequence of numbers that may pose an interesting variation to the problems given. In response to this extension, Brandon created the following product: “5 × 10 × 15 × 20 × 25 × 30” (see fig. 5). He thought that this variation would be interesting because there were more factors of 5 than factors of 2, unlike all the previous examples. It also forced students to remember that factors of both 2 and 5 being paired would yield a 0 at the end of the product.",,

31,How Many Zeroes at the End_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics(1),The editors wish to thank Jennifer Marshall for her reflection and her students’ work. The willingness of teachers and students to share their work and their use of the task with MTMS readers benefits the mathematics education profession. It also allows us to provide other middle school math teachers with insights into the use of nontraditional tasks and into the thinking of students.,,
