0,Brotherly Love - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,This problem first appeared in the April 2015 issue:,,
1,Brotherly Love - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Jeff said to his younger brother, Mike, “Give me 8 of your video games, and then I’ll have twice as many games as you have.” Mike said, “No way! You give me 8 of your games, and then we’ll have the same number of games.” How many games did each boy have before any video games were swapped?",,

4,Brotherly Love - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Two students in Andrea Kowalchik Dwenger’s class used different methods to solve this month’s problem, Brotherly Love. One student used a guess-and-check approach (see fig. 1), explaining that he “chose two numbers and went through a sequence of adding 8 to [the number of games owned by] Jeff and subtracting 8 from [the number of games owned by] Mike.” At that point, he could check to see if Jeff’s stack was twice the size of Mike’s stack before choosing another set of numbers. The student went on to explain that “he next subtracted 8 from Jeff’s original stack of games and added 8 to Mike’s game stack.” This step was a check to see if the second criterion mentioned in the problem was met: Did the stacks contain the same number of games? This student’s work illustrated his final answer that Jeff’s stack had 56 games and Mike’s stack had 40 games.",,

6,Brotherly Love - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"A second student, Megan, chose an algebraic method (see fig. 2). She explained that she began by creating equations that explained the two connections between Jeff’s and Mike’s numbers of video games:",,
7,Brotherly Love - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
8,Brotherly Love - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I needed to isolate “M” by subtracting 8 from both sides. This left me with J – 16 = M. I then replaced “M” in the first equations with J – 16, and that resulted in an equation, so J – 16 – 8 = 1/2(J + 8).",,
9,Brotherly Love - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Next, Megan combined numbers and used the distributive property to obtain the equation",,
10,Brotherly Love - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,J – 24 = (1/2)J + 4:,,
11,Brotherly Love - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"After that, I subtracted half “J” from either side, to create a (1/2)J – 24 = 4. Then I multiplied each number by 2, to make a whole “J” and that led to an equation of J – 48 = 8. Finally, I added 48 to each side, ending with J = 56. Since I know that Jeff has 56 videogames, and J – 16 = M, I just subtracted 16 from 56 to get Mike’s total amount of 40 video games.",,
12,Brotherly Love - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Both students were successful in solving the problem even though they used different methods. Teachers can encourage students to solve problems in ways that make sense to them and then help students make connections among the different strategies so that they learn from one another. The organized guess-and-check process described by the first student illustrated the algebraic meaning of both equations that Megan used.,,
13,Brotherly Love - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The problems posed in the Solve It Student Thinking department invite a variety of solution strategies and provide teachers with opportunities to let students share their unique ways of thinking. We encourage you to use these problems with your students, reflect on and marvel at the work your students do, and then share your experiences with other MTMS readers.",,
14,Brotherly Love - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Thank you to Andrea Kowalchik Dwenger, Wilmette Junior High School in Wilmette, Illinois, for submitting her students’ work for this month’s Brotherly Love Solve It Student Thinking article. Dwenger told us that she uses these problems as extra-credit Problem of the Week (POW) tasks. This is just one way that teachers can use Solve It problems in their classrooms. Other teachers have used this department’s problems as class activities to elicit students’ thinking about important mathematical ideas.",,
15,Brotherly Love - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Each problem is aligned with one or more of the Common Core’ content standards and is also designed to develop several of the Standards for Mathematical Practice (CCSSI 2010). We encourage teachers to use the problems as part of their regular instruction or as a supplemental resource. Sharing student work with our readers helps all of us learn more about mathematics and how students think about mathematical problems. The examples, designed to provide students with multiple entry points into the task, can also be solved through a variety of methods.",,
