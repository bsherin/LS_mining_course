"Functions and equations are the  central focus of this book, which gives several applications of linear and quadratic equations and examines the algorithms used to solve equations. Inequalities are briefly examined. The book presents a useful discussion of why the inequality sign reverses when the student is multiplying by a negative number. Functions are represented using algebraic symbols, verbal descriptions, tables, and graphs. Tables and graphs are thoroughly discussed and used to reach conclusions about functions. Middle school teachers reading this book should be able to solve  linear equations, linear inequalities, and quadratic equations and should be familiar with such terms as  domain, rate of change, and the  quadratic formula.",9,mtms2012-12-317a,,
"Developing Essential Understanding of Expressions, Equations and Functions is an excellent source of information for middle school teachers. It focuses on concepts needed to thoroughly understand expressions, equations, and functions. It examines students’ understanding at the elementary level and what is needed at the middle school level to help students understand more advanced functions in high school. I recommend this book for middle school teachers.",10,mtms2012-12-317a,,

"How Do We Know? Yes, You Can Learn Algebra! is a workbook that can be used to review many prealgebra skills that are needed before students enter algebra. It covers topics such as combining like terms, computing slope, and solving equations. It does not delve into other topics associated with algebra, such as factoring polynomials or solving systems of equations.",16,mtms2012-12-317a,,
"The book focuses primarily on  mathematical procedures versus real-life applications or conceptual understandings. For example, when teaching adding and subtracting integers, it lists five rules to follow and supplies a table of examples to complete. Space is provided to list the justification. It does not show any other methods for teaching this concept, such as using a number line, integer tiles, or real-life examples. Each section also includes definitions related to that topic. The definitions range in precision. An integer is defined as “A whole number. Examples -6, -3, 0, 1, 2, 3.” A line is defined as “a thin threadlike mark, a row of things, as of number points across a page.”",17,mtms2012-12-317a,,
"Although it is clear that the  author is passionate about mathematics and hopes that others find similar success, I am skeptical that students who need remediation in prealgebra will benefit from a highly procedural approach to math. The workbook does not support many of the Mathematical Practices found in the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics or the Process Standards in Principles and Standards for School Mathematics. Students may end up with weak understandings as a result.",18,mtms2012-12-317a,,

"Steven Leinwand describes “what,” “how,” and “how to support” pillars of the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSM), which asks educators to shift to a program that uses computation and symbol manipulation so that students develop a deeper understanding of mathematics and its applications. The author supplies a list of basic math skills that are still necessary. Many readers will be surprised at what is not included. ",22,mtms2012-12-317a,,
"The “how” involves exploring  modeling, providing interesting tasks, and delving into complex relationships, often through asking probing questions. He supplies a set of questions that leaders must be able to reasonably answer; however, he does not answer them. Perhaps the lack of specific answers indicates that although CCSSM is national in scope,  we need to understand and implement the Mathematical Practices with an eye toward the needs of our local community and schools.",23,mtms2012-12-317a,,
"Leinwand provides strategies for  collecting artifacts to support the changes envisioned by CCSSM as well as many samples of real-world embedded mathematics as compared with traditional school mathematics. Presented are protocols for analyzing teachers’ lessons, lists of professional development strategies that work, and suggested activities for developing a mathematical community of learners. Using “if, then” logic, he clearly describes two belief systems and what would be evident in a mathematics classroom for each system. Also included are tables that will help the reader analyze where he or she is and what needs to be accomplished to successfully implement CCSSM.",24,mtms2012-12-317a,,
"This is a good read for any math educator but a must read for anyone responsible for moving math education forward. It might be used as a source for professional development and discussions at the grade, school, and district levels as well as by any  leader charged with helping teachers implement CCSSM.",25,mtms2012-12-317a,,

The goal of Seltzer’s book is to enhance the learning process by exploring exercises that encourage students to develop an understanding  of geometry by experimenting and drawing conclusions. This book is  not to be used as a substitute for the primary textbook but as a supplement to help students understand concepts through discovery and enrichment.,31,mtms2012-12-317a,,
"The reproducible pages are well designed and student friendly. However, some activities seem to jump to conclusions too quickly. All students may be unable to discover the correct formula through patterns found in only a few problems, making the teacher’s role crucial in facilitating the lesson. In addition to the workbook pages, the book features “Main Idea” pages that provide definitions and other information to assist teachers. The lessons are correlated to the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics. The book contains a helpful CD with digital pages from the book and a virtual manipulative. ",32,mtms2012-12-317a,,
"Although this product centers on  working with a geoboard, many of the practice pages may be completed using pictures instead of an actual geoboard. The format of the book increases its versatility because it can be used in a classroom, instead of an actual geoboard, if there are too few to go around. ",33,mtms2012-12-317a,,
"Since many of the activities are centered on higher-order thinking, Working with the Geoboard is recommended for middle school mathematics teachers who are looking for enrichment ideas to incorporate into their geometry units. It is also recommended for students who  are kinesthetic learners and visual learners.  —Jamie Thurgood",34,mtms2012-12-317a,,
