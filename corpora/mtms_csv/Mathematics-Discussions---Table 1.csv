10,Mathematics Discussions: Expectations Matter,"It is vital that students engage in such experiences in purposeful ways. However, in a more traditional setting, some students have experienced success in mathematics in other ways, such as by reviewing their homework, “checking” for right answers, and volunteering in class. ",10,Mathematics Discussions: Expectations Matter
11,Mathematics Discussions: Expectations Matter,"As we consider what it means for  our students to “do mathematics” successfully, we must explore our role as teachers in a way that strategically supports students as powerful agents for their own learning. As we foster a classroom environment based on agreed-on expectations, we must help students learn how to engage in whole-class discussions that create opportunities for learning among all students (Stephan and Whitenack 2003).

12,Mathematics Discussions: Expectations Matter,"Smith and Stein (2011) identiﬁ ed ﬁ ve instructional practices rooted in students’ thinking that guide teachers in making important mathematical ideas public. In concert with engaging in the ﬁ ve practices, it is essential for a teacher to foster a classroom environment in which sense making remains central to daily learning experiences. One strategic way to build a classroom environment rich with mathematical discussions is to engage students in mathematical tasks that require them to build their understanding on the reasoning of others (Knudsen et al. 2014). ",12,Mathematics Discussions: Expectations Matter
13,Mathematics Discussions: Expectations Matter,"As students discuss a task, the  teacher’s role is to continually work with them to negotiate what highquality discourse sounds like. For example, it is important to establish student expectations, such as that all students will— 1.  participate, even those who do not  raise their hands;  2.  explain and justify their thinking; 3.  restate a classmate’s reasoning; 4.  make sense of another classmate’s  reasoning; and  5.  ask a question if they are not sure  that they understand.

17,Mathematics Discussions: Expectations Matter,"Arithmetic to Algebra: Leveraging Prior Knowledge Our classroom episode focuses on the concept of the distributive property. Some students in the middle grades lack necessary understanding of the distributive property (Edwards 2000). Often, the way the distributive property is presented limits students’ understanding. For example, Ding and Li (2010) point out that strategies regarding the distributive property are mainly presented with whole numbers and follow the “regular” direction of expansion from left ",17,Mathematics Discussions: Expectations Matter

19,Mathematics Discussions: Expectations Matter,"First, by the end of the lesson the students would be able to leverage their procedural knowledge of the distributive property to recognize and articulate the understanding that algebraic expressions in different forms can be equivalent (NCTM 2006). Second, students would explore equivalent forms of an algebraic expression and discover a generalization of the distributive property (Carpenter, Franke, and Levi 2003). The National Research Council (2001) has described students’ proﬁ ciency with mathematical ideas as a combination of ﬁ ve interwoven strands, including both procedural fl uency and conceptual understanding. We sought to leverage the procedural knowledge of the students to construct more conceptual understandings, which would eventually lead to greater proﬁ ciency with the distributive property through classroom-level discourse. We hope this episode will serve as a model for other middle school mathematics teachers as they embark on their own journey toward supporting their students as they move toward purposefully engaging in whole-class discussions.",19,Mathematics Discussions: Expectations Matter
20,Mathematics Discussions: Expectations Matter,Beginning the Conversation The teacher began by introducing a clear set of expectations that the class would follow when investigating the task. The following dialogue represents a portion of that conversation. ,20,Mathematics Discussions: Expectations Matter

31,Mathematics Discussions: Expectations Matter,Jordan: Some of us may have questions.,31,Mathematics Discussions: Expectations Matter
32,Mathematics Discussions: Expectations Matter,Teacher: Good; someone may have a question. What else did they say?,32,Mathematics Discussions: Expectations Matter
33,Mathematics Discussions: Expectations Matter,Izzy: Kind of like a warning that you [teacher] are like watching them.,33,Mathematics Discussions: Expectations Matter
34,Mathematics Discussions: Expectations Matter,Shawn: To make sure that we are paying attention.,34,Mathematics Discussions: Expectations Matter
35,Mathematics Discussions: Expectations Matter,"Although some students thought that a major reason the teacher would call on them was to maintain classroom management, this was not the case. The teacher intentionally introduced the expectation that all students would participate in the class discussion—not just the students who raised their hands—so that each student’s mathematical reasoning could be included. Furthermore, when the teacher called on Jordan to rephrase her peers’ thinking, the teacher initiated the expectation that each student would listen actively to what his or her peers were explaining. Participation by all students and active listening were two of the classroom expectations established, and their signiﬁ cance cannot be overstated. Establishing these key expectations creates an environment in which students can support one another’s thinking. This environment supports a refl exivity in which individuals contribute to the mathematical understandings of the class while, at the same time, the whole class impacts the ways an individual thinks about the mathematics (Cobb and Yackel 1996). Furthermore, it allows the teacher to call on students who may have a mathematical contribution but feel that their status is not high enough to contribute during wholeclass discussion (Civil and Planas 2004). The emphasis on these two expectations resulted in all students in the class contributing to the discussion during the lesson. After the teacher had introduced and discussed the  expectations, students explored the following task:",35,Mathematics Discussions: Expectations Matter
36,Mathematics Discussions: Expectations Matter,"Soﬁ a thinks 2(12x + 24) can be rewritten as 6(4x + 8), but Andre thinks it cannot.",36,Mathematics Discussions: Expectations Matter
37,Mathematics Discussions: Expectations Matter,• Who is right? How do you know? •  What are other equivalent ways of writing 2(12x + 24)?,37,Mathematics Discussions: Expectations Matter
38,Mathematics Discussions: Expectations Matter,"The initial question in the task was meant to leverage students’ procedural knowledge of the distributive property and serve as a foundation from which the students would eventually generalize the property. To accomplish this goal, we gave students individual think time and then prompted them to share their thinking with a shoulder partner. This pair dialogue was an essential step in creating an environment in which students felt comfortable sharing their thinking. It simultaneously reinforced the expectation that students ought to be prepared to explain and justify their reasoning as well as the expectation that they make sense of another’s reasoning. Studentto-student dialogue is fundamental in a whole-class discussion. After the students quickly established that Soﬁ a was correct, the teacher sparked the whole-class discussion by inviting individuals to share their initial thoughts regarding other equivalent ways the expression could be written (see ﬁ g. 1).

39,Mathematics Discussions: Expectations Matter,This allowed the teacher to monitor and sequence (Smith and Stein 2011) reasoning by allowing students to publicize their initial conceptions ,39,Mathematics Discussions: Expectations Matter

Moreover, it supported the view that mathematics learning should focus on developing and connecting concepts and procedures by having students reason and engage in discourse (NCTM 2014), while also providing the members of the class with an opportunity to question a rigid interpretation of the order of operations (Karp, Bush, and Dougherty 2015). By engaging in classroom dialogue facilitated by the teacher, the students made sense of like terms and the order of operations as they explored the task focused on the distributive property.",53,Mathematics Discussions: Expectations Matter
54,Mathematics Discussions: Expectations Matter,"As the whole-class dialogue continued, we anticipated that students would correctly distribute whole number quantities to each term in the parentheses; however, we wanted students to move beyond this procedural understanding to reason more fl exibly and consider other equivalent ways that the algebraic expression could be written. Consequently, in the next part of the task, students were challenged to generate expressions equivalent to 2(12x + 24). The following portion of whole-class dialogue consistent with the goals and expectations of the teacher showcases a student’s response to the task and how other students in the class made sense of her reasoning.",54,Mathematics Discussions: Expectations Matter

62,Mathematics Discussions: Expectations Matter,Cam: I do! [Students laugh.],62,Mathematics Discussions: Expectations Matter
63,Mathematics Discussions: Expectations Matter,"Many of the students expressed the same excitement when negative coefﬁ cients were suggested because the idea opened the door to an entirely new way of thinking about this task. At this point, if the expectation to make one’s thinking public had not been introduced at the beginning, Cam might have continued to hold on to a myopic understanding of the property. Moreover, when students publicize their thinking in conversations such as this one, the teacher and students are able to assess student thinking in a nonthreatening and inviting way that results in expanded thinking that is a valuable source of sense making. The brief dialogue also demonstrates how students must be active listeners to what their classmates are saying and be ready to react and contribute to each other’s learning during a classroom discussion. Although students often want to default to their own thought process, it is vital that we as teachers make this expectation explicit—active listening is at the core of students’ ability to reﬁ ne their understanding of mathematics through examining the thinking of others. As the conversation continued, another student then suggested the decimal expansion shown in ﬁ gure 3, which became the impetus for students to explore equivalent expressions in a more generalized way. This new situation led to the following dialogue, which highlights students’ investigation of equivalence.",63,Mathematics Discussions: Expectations Matter

Furthermore, arriving at a generalization showcases how building student understanding of the distributive property through a meaningful progression can help students truly understand a mathematical concept—developing conceptual understanding and procedural fl uency simultaneously. In our case, our progression began with a review of the distributive property arithmetically, followed by a large portion of the task dedicated to the discovery that there are an inﬁ nite number of equivalent expressions, and ﬁ nally culminating in abstracting an algebraic generalization (Driscoll 1999).",99,Mathematics Discussions: Expectations Matter
