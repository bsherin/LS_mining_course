"To bolster students’ ability to prove as well as develop mathematical argumentation skills, create an environment in which students must regularly explain and justify their thinking.",1,mtms2009-11-232a,,
"mMathematical argumentation is an  important skill. It leads to the process of proof, which is one area that students are being asked to master by the end of secondary school. Encouraging explanation and justification in math class allows this skill to develop. Explaining and justifying their ideas forces students to think deeply about mathematics and informally prove in preparation for more formal proof writing. However, developing a classroom in which explanation and justification are common is a challenge.",2,mtms2009-11-232a,,
The process of proof cannot simply  begin in the later years of secondary education. Students must develop the skills required to reason mathematically from kindergarten through grade 12. Our goal with this article is to help facilitate this process by putting  into practice a tool from mathematics education research. We share a helpful framework for reflecting on mathematics discourse in the classroom. We also analyze actual classroom episodes using this framework and think about how to apply the framework in practice.,3,mtms2009-11-232a,,
"NCTM emphasizes the importance of proof. “By the end of secondary school, students should be able to understand and produce mathematical proofs—arguments consisting of logically rigorous deductions of conclusions from hypotheses—and should appreciate the value of such arguments” (2000, p. 56).

"We use the Math Talk Learning Community Framework (HufferdAckles, Fuson, and Sherin 2004), herein referred to as the Math Talk Framework (see table 1), as a way to assess discourse and develop the processes of explanation and justification. It assesses discourse through the following four components:  1.  Questioning 2.  Explaining mathematical thinking 3.  Noting the source of mathematical  ideas 4.  Taking responsibility for learning",5,mtms2009-11-232a,,
"We focus most prominently on the component of explaining mathematical thinking; however, because each component is inherently connected to  the others, we also include an examination of the other three. ",6,mtms2009-11-232a,,
"The Math Talk Framework is broken into four levels, ranging from 0 to 3. Level 0 represents a more teacher-centered classroom; in a level 3 classroom, teacher and students share responsibility for student learning through discourse. The progression within each component from level 0 to 3 requires a shifting of the focus from the teacher to the students—the classroom community—so that students become primarily responsible for questioning, explaining, and providing mathematical ideas. To promote explanation and justification of ideas and strategies, a teacher should work to progress from a lower level to a higher level.",7,mtms2009-11-232a,,
"At levels 2 and 3, the focus is no  longer on the teacher but on the classroom community in which the teacher and students play essential roles. With the teacher serving a more peripheral role, students are responsible for  explaining and justifying their ideas and strategies to the other members of the learning community. By doing so, students can begin to build on one another’s mathematical thinking, which provides a rich context for  table 1 this Math talk framework helps guide teachers when reflecting on mathematics discourse in the classroom.",8,mtms2009-11-232a,,
"level classroom characteristics the classroom is teacher-centered, with the teacher serving as the primary questioner, source of mathematical ideas, and authority to verify the correctness of solutions. Students are mostly passive, giving only short answers as prompted by the teacher.  the teacher begins to share responsibility for learning with the students. While maintaining the central role, the teacher begins to probe student thinking. Students’ explanations are brief.  the teacher and students share responsibility for learning. the teacher probes students more deeply and uses student errors for learning opportunities. Students ask questions of one another, explain and defend their ideas, and build on the ideas of their peers.",9,mtms2009-11-232a,,

In addition, Manouchehri and St. Jon (2006) argue that “Students must become able to make and state mathematical observations on their own, take ownership of the thinking that must be done, and break away from the belief, fostered by much of the schooling process, that authority resides only in books and teachers” (p. 550). Learning communities at levels 2 and 3 help to accomplish this because, without the teacher to ascribe “correctness,” students must evaluate each other’s ideas and strategies, forcing them to explain and justify until they reach a correct answer and full understanding of the concept.

Episode Illustrating a Level 2/3,26,mtms2009-11-232a,,
"To see how the Math Talk Framework can be applied within a math class, we focus on the efforts of Mr. D., an eighth-grade algebra teacher. We trace the development of a learning community in his classroom through the use of three excerpts. The first two excerpts come from the same lesson on simplifying variable expressions; the third excerpt comes from a lesson on order of operations.",27,mtms2009-11-232a,,
Mr. D. began the lesson with the  following example: ,28,mtms2009-11-232a,,
Simplify (2b)(−3). ,29,mtms2009-11-232a,,
"After the class decided that the answer was −6b, Mr. D. moved to a second example of simplifying (2b)(3a). The verbatim dialogue, transcribed in figure 1, demonstrates how Mr. D. places the responsibility for determining the solution on his students.",30,mtms2009-11-232a,,
"Mr. D. resisted the temptation to tell Rick that he was wrong. Instead, he allowed Rick to explain his thinking and reasoning, albeit wrong, about the process. In so doing, he uncovered student misconceptions. Additionally, by responding to Rick’s answer as he  did, Mr. D. validated Rick’s contribution to the conversation before bringing it to the community for evaluation. Cooke and Adams explained, “In order to overcome student fears that their answers will be wrong or that other students will not listen respectfully, the teacher must work to build trust” (1998, p. 35). By confirming that he appreciated Rick’s idea for its value in discussion, Mr. D. was building trust in this learning community. ",31,mtms2009-11-232a,,
"The second excerpt, transcribed  in figure 2, immediately followed the lesson. Mr. D. gave the community the opportunity to have a mathematical argument about the difference between adding and multiplying variable expressions that were raised from Rick’s idea about like terms.",32,mtms2009-11-232a,,
"Mr. D.’s decision to focus the class  discussion on Rick’s idea provided a rich context for mathematical argumentation. For example, Mike summarized that all operations can be carried out when there is only one variable. However, he said you cannot add two different variables together. Ali then built on this idea by explaining that two different variables can be combined through multiplication because you can “split [the terms] apart” and then multiply. Although Mr. D. might have taken the opportunity to suggest that Ali use a different word than “split,” which could suggest addition, these ideas might not have emerged if Mr. D. had simply identified Rick’s idea as “wrong” and told students that like terms are only required for addition and subtraction. The discourse that transpired allowed students to think about the differences among adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing variable expressions and which operations require like terms.",33,mtms2009-11-232a,,
"When managing group discussion,  these questions always arise: 1.  How much do individuals in the  classroom gain?",34,mtms2009-11-232a,,
"Fig. 2 excerpt 2: in this discussion, the class considers the information elicited from Rick about like terms.",35,mtms2009-11-232a,,
Mr. D.: Up here though. [Motions to (2b)(–3)] Are these two like terms? ,36,mtms2009-11-232a,,
Because we carried out the multiplication? Leah?,37,mtms2009-11-232a,,
"Leah: Um, when you have the variables [inaudible] because, like, you can  multiply. Because you’re multiplying 2 × 3 anyway.",38,mtms2009-11-232a,,
"Mr. D.: Mmmmm. Leah: So, 2 × 3 is 6. And then, you can’t, and then, it’s gonna be negative. it’s gonna be negative, −6 × b. But, see, then you multiply 2b × 3 and it becomes 3a. okay. No, you can’t do the first one the way we did it.",39,mtms2009-11-232a,,
Mr. D.: okay. So now you’re saying no. Mike?,40,mtms2009-11-232a,,
"Mike: You can add, subtract, divide, and multiply the amount of variable you  have. But you can’t add another variable with it.",41,mtms2009-11-232a,,
Mr. D.: okay. Let’s try that again. Say that again. Repeat it.,42,mtms2009-11-232a,,
"Mike: You can’t add. You can add, subtract, multiply, or divide a variable. ",43,mtms2009-11-232a,,
But you cannot add another variable to it.,44,mtms2009-11-232a,,
Mr. D.: Another variable to it?,45,mtms2009-11-232a,,
"Mike: Like, a different variable.",46,mtms2009-11-232a,,
Mr. D.: okay. okay. So we’re adding. You cannot add two different types of  variables together? Right?,47,mtms2009-11-232a,,
Mike: Yeah. Mr. D.: okay. What about multiplying two different variables together? [He pauses for students to consider.],48,mtms2009-11-232a,,
Mr. D.: Ali?,49,mtms2009-11-232a,,
"Ali: for that, for the second problem [(2b)(3a)], isn’t it basically 2 × b × 3 × a? ",50,mtms2009-11-232a,,
"So, like, if you split the 2 and the b and the 3 and the a apart, it would be the same problem, right? ",51,mtms2009-11-232a,,
Mr. D.: Right.,52,mtms2009-11-232a,,
Ali: So you could multiply 2 × 3 to give you 6. Right. it would be 6ab.,53,mtms2009-11-232a,,
"Mr. D.: okay. So, you’re saying the answer to this is 6ab?",54,mtms2009-11-232a,,
Ali: exactly.,55,mtms2009-11-232a,,
Mr. D.: Kaylen?,56,mtms2009-11-232a,,
"Kaylen: oh yeah. there’s, there’s always like, when i think of algebra when my brother was doing it. He would always do something like, you know,  a × b = ab. But, like, you can’t do that with addition or subtraction,  because you need like terms. But i was thinking that multiplying and dividing the terms don’t matter.",57,mtms2009-11-232a,,
2.  Are silent members engaged in the  discussion?,58,mtms2009-11-232a,,
"In excerpt 1 (fig. 1), Mike, Ali, and Kaylen were silent observers. Because these three students joined the conversation in excerpt 2 (fig. 2), it is clear that they felt compelled to contribute their ideas after actively listening and considering the mathematics. Their silent participation became vocal participation. Hillen and Smith (2007) proposed that when the discourse is rich and full of explanation and justification, silent members of a learning community can gain new understanding. ",59,mtms2009-11-232a,,
"Because Mr. D., rather than the  students, asked most of the questions in these two excerpts, the interaction did not reach level 3 of the Math Talk Framework. In these excerpts, Mr. D. probed his students to explain their ideas and justify them as they argued for their point.

"To achieve a level 2 or 3 on the Math Talk Framework, the teacher needs  to take a more peripheral role and allow students to generate the questions and discussion.  •	 What	specific	strategies	might	you	employ	in	your	classroom	to	help	  develop this culture?  •	 In	what	ways	can	you	encourage	your	students	to	ask	more	questions	of	one	 another so that you are not the sole facilitator of the classroom discourse?",64,mtms2009-11-232a,,
"In the first excerpt (see fig. 1), Rick struggled with the notion of “like terms” and what operations one must consider “like terms.”  •	 How	do	you	help	students	make	sense	of	like	terms	when	using	variables?	 •	 How	is	this	similar	to	or	different	from	students’	fragile	understanding	of	 the need for common denominators in certain situations?",65,mtms2009-11-232a,,
"In the second excerpt (see fig. 2), several new students enter the conversation who were silent earlier. Research mentioned in the article suggests that silent participants can benefit from discourse that is rich and full of justification.  •	 What	are	some	strategies	to	assess	whether	these	silent	participants	really	 gain new understanding from that day’s discussion?  •	 What	techniques	do	you	use	to	provide	closure	to	any	discussion	to	ensure	 that all students are taking away new understanding?",66,mtms2009-11-232a,,

This is consistent with the notion from the Professional Standards for Teaching Mathematics (1995) that teachers must serve as the facilitator who must both filter while directing students’ explorations as well as provide information while leading students.

Episode Illustrating a Level 0/1,71,mtms2009-11-232a,,
"The interaction that occurred in the first episode showed an example of discourse when striving for level 2 in managing incorrect answers. In contrast, we would like to explore an excerpt in which managing an incorrect answer does not reach a level 2 or 3, to analyze what a teacher applying the Math Talk Framework might consider changing. In the following excerpt, Mr. D.’s class was practicing simplifying numerical expressions by working through a problem. Their task was to identify the mathematical properties they used in simplifying the expression on the left-hand side of the following identity:",72,mtms2009-11-232a,,
"First, one student suggested using substitution for 6² = 36 to get ",73,mtms2009-11-232a,,

Excerpt 3 Anne: Wouldn’t you distribute the four  since it’s outside?,75,mtms2009-11-232a,,
Mr. D.: You wanted to use . . . you want  to use the distributive property to distribute the four throughout?,76,mtms2009-11-232a,,
Anne: Yeah.,77,mtms2009-11-232a,,

Mr. D.: Let’s work through this  problem. Go ahead. I want you to rework distributing the four. ,81,mtms2009-11-232a,,
"At this point, Anne came to the board to discuss her idea. As Mr. D. worked through the problem with Anne, he turned his back on the remainder of his class. While Anne and Mr. D. faced the board and engaged in a discussion that allowed Anne to see the error in her thinking, the students seated at their desks were staring off, flipping through notebooks, and talking. Once Anne believed she understood, she returned to her seat, and Mr. D. proceeded with the problem.",82,mtms2009-11-232a,,
It is important to note here that ,83,mtms2009-11-232a,,
"Mr. D. never identified Anne’s idea as being “wrong” or “incorrect.” In fact, his decision to have her come to the board to discuss her idea had the potential to begin a classwide discussion about whether or not the distributive property was an appropriate step. However, the dialogue that occurred as a result of Anne’s idea did not reach the whole class. Although he questioned Anne’s thinking and used her errors for learning opportunities, his interaction with her to the exclusion of the rest of the class prevented them from asking questions of one another and building off the ideas of their peers. For these reasons, we believe this interaction reached level 1 of the Math Talk Framework. ",84,mtms2009-11-232a,,
"It is a common mistake among  middle school students to apply the  distributive property whenever a constant is multiplied by a quantity within a set of parentheses. Thus, it was likely that other members of Mr. D.’s learning community agreed with Anne and believed applying the distributive property was an appropriate step. Although the discussion between Anne and Mr. D. helped to clarify Anne’s thinking, it was unable to help other members of the community. As Anne and Mr. D. faced the board, their backs blocked the remainder of the community from seeing the work and hearing the discussion. As opposed to excerpt 2, in which silent members of the community could still be silent participants in the discussion, Mr. D. actually interfered with the participation of the seated students by excluding them from the conversation and limiting their opportunities to explain and justify.  eXPloRing alteRnatiVe decisions and actions",85,mtms2009-11-232a,,
We propose that the interaction observed in excerpt 3 could be changed to reach the entire community. We offer two alternatives that Mr. D. could have used in managing Anne’s incorrect use of the distributive property. These alternatives explore how Anne’s idea presented in excerpt 2 (fig. 2) could begin a level 2 interaction:,86,mtms2009-11-232a,,
Anne: Wouldn’t you distribute the four  since it’s outside?,87,mtms2009-11-232a,,
Mr. D.: You wanted to use . . . you  want to use the distributive property to distribute the four throughout?,88,mtms2009-11-232a,,
Anne: Yeah.,89,mtms2009-11-232a,,
"Alternative 1 At this point, instead of immediately bringing Anne to the board, Mr. D. could address the entire class, “Does anyone agree or disagree with Anne’s idea?” Consistent with level 2, this question places responsibility for understanding on the students because it sets up the structure for building (Sherin, Louis, and Mendez 2000). By asking this question, Mr. D. communicates that he is not solely responsible for verifying the “correctness” of Anne’s thinking. Instead, he directs the idea to the entire community for evaluation. However, from excerpt 1, we see that students do not always readily respond to this question, which in turn requires the teacher to persist in uncovering students’ thinking. Mr. D. could prompt students to work in pairs on Anne’s suggestion for a few minutes. With this additional time to think, students might contribute more to the discussion. ",90,mtms2009-11-232a,,
Alternative 2,91,mtms2009-11-232a,,
"On the other hand, Mr. D. could bring Anne to the board as he did in the original excerpt 3. To ensure that the entire community is able to participate in the evaluation and discussion of Anne’s idea, Mr. D. could modify the discussion as follows.",92,mtms2009-11-232a,,
"Mr. D.: Anne, please use your idea to work through the next step of this problem at the board, explaining what you are doing. [Directed to the class] As Anne  works, the rest of us should listen and come up with a question to ask her.",93,mtms2009-11-232a,,
"In this step, Anne is asked to justify her idea so that the rest of the class can understand her thinking. Mr. D. helps students to take an active role by encouraging them to listen to Anne and prepare a question to ask her. This encouragement prepares the way for student-to-student talk, which is an important component of level 2 and 3 interactions and a fertile environment for explanation and justification. ",94,mtms2009-11-232a,,
"The alternatives suggested here are  just two possibilities that could help manage Anne’s incorrect use of the distributive property by holding the class responsible for understanding and evaluating the idea. The point here is that Mr. D. is not responsible for correcting Anne’s thinking; instead, he shifts the authority so that it is shared with the entire class. As a result, students play more active roles in the discussion and learning and hold one another accountable for explanation and justification. ",95,mtms2009-11-232a,,
Using the FRaMeWoRK  in PRactice,96,mtms2009-11-232a,,
"The excerpts presented here displayed different ways that incorrect answers can be used to foster explanation and justification in mathematics classrooms. All three excerpts show classroom interactions that are possible when teachers resist the temptation to immediately correct  every incorrect statement or  step. However, because  the discourse in excerpt 3 does not reach the  entire class, it is  not as effective as the discourse in excerpts 1 and 2. To effectively promote classroom discourse while managing an incorrect answer, a teacher should strive for a level 3 interaction that elicits the participation of every student through either verbal or silent participation. The Math Talk Framework presents math teachers with a useful way to assess classroom discourse, whether or not it is in the context of managing incorrect answers. In particular, through the various levels, the framework allows teachers a means for determining whether students have enough responsibility for providing explanation and justification of their ideas and strategies. Using the excerpts and ideas presented in this article, teachers can determine ways to alter the discourse community so that it reaches level 3.",97,mtms2009-11-232a,,
"By fostering a classroom learning community at level 3, a teacher imparts a great deal of responsibility for learning on his or her students.
