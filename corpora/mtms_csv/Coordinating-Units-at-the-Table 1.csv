0,Coordinating Units at the CandyDepot - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"How do your students think about improper fractions? Is seeing an improper fraction a prompt for them to convert it to a mixed number, or are your students comfortable leaving it alone? Are improper fractions actually division problems to solve, or are they solutions to those problems? Mathematician and Fields Medalist Bill Thurston recalled the moment when improper fractions became numbers for him:",,
1,Coordinating Units at the CandyDepot - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I remember as a child, in fifth grade, coming to the amazing (to me) realization that the answer to 134 divided by 29 is 134/29 (and so forth). What a tremendous labor-saving device! To me, 134 divided by 29 meant a certain tedious chore, while 134/29 was an object with no implicit work. I went excitedly to my father to explain my major discovery. He told me that of course this is so, a/b and a divided by b are just synonyms. To him it was just a small variation in notation. (Thurston 1990, p. 848)",,
2,Coordinating Units at the CandyDepot - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"As parents, we should honor these epiphanies. As teachers, we should appreciate their psychological origins so that we can promote them.",,
3,Coordinating Units at the CandyDepot - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Thurston had come to understand improper fractions as mathematical objects, or numbers in their own right (Hackenberg 2007, p. 27), rather than the division of two whole numbers. Developing such an understanding requires the coordination of three levels of units: a whole (1); a unit fraction (1/b); and the improper fraction as a unit itself, made up of a units of 1/b. Figure 1 illustrates a structure for coordinating these three levels of units: 8/3 is a unit composed of eight units of 1/3, three of which make the whole unit. Coordinating the three levels of units (8/3, 1/3, and 1) in this way enables students to make sense of 8/3 as a single fractional number, rather than two whole numbers (8 and 3). It also focuses students on the size of the fraction relative to 1/3 and the whole.",,
4,Coordinating Units at the CandyDepot - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
5,Coordinating Units at the CandyDepot - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In general, units coordination refers to the relationships that students can maintain between various units when working within a numerical situation. It is critical that middle school students learn to coordinate three levels of units not only because of their importance in understanding fractions but also because of their implications for multiplicative reasoning and algebra readiness.",,
6,Coordinating Units at the CandyDepot - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Students begin coordinating units and developing multiplicative reasoning while learning about whole numbers (Steffe and Olive 2010). Students can then reorganize these units coordinations in establishing knowledge of fractions and algebraic reasoning (Hackenberg and Lee 2015; Steffe 2002). For example, consider the role of units coordination in understanding 24 as eight units of 3 (see fig. 2). This multiplicative structure differs from the one represented in figure 1 in that it contains eight units of 3 instead of eight units of 1/3. Thus, in moving from units coordination in multiplicative reasoning to units coordination with fractions, the reorganization that students need to make involves maintaining the whole of which 1/3 is a part, just as they maintain the three 1s that comprise 3. In other words, 1/3 must become for them a 3-to-1 size relation between the unit fraction and the whole; it must be understood as a part that could be iterated three times to produce the whole. Then, the third level of units would remain the same: eight units of 1/3 (or 3).",,

8,Coordinating Units at the CandyDepot - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,ASSESSING UNITS COORDINATION,,
9,Coordinating Units at the CandyDepot - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In middle school, we can expect to find students coordinating units at any of three stages, depending on the number of levels of units they can coordinate at once. We used variations of the bars task (illustrated in fig. 3) to assess students stages of units coordination.",,
10,Coordinating Units at the CandyDepot - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
11,Coordinating Units at the CandyDepot - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"First, we asked students to determine how many times the small blue bar fits into the medium yellow bar. Then we asked them how many times the medium yellow bar fits into the long red bar. Finally, we asked students to use the information to determine the number of times the small blue bar will fit into the long red bar. Table 1 summarizes student responses, which indicate how developed they were at stages of units coordination.",,
12,Coordinating Units at the CandyDepot - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
13,Coordinating Units at the CandyDepot - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Students who are at stage 1 do not anticipate coordinating two levels of units but can engage in an activity to work out such coordinations. For the task in figure 3, a student at stage 1 might look at the blue bar and imagine how many times it would fit into the red bar without considering the intermediate relations between the blue and yellow bar, or the yellow and red bar. Students at stage 2 can anticipate two-level relations, but they would need to work out the third level of units coordination through activity, such as iterating the four 3s that comprise the blue-yellow relation. Only students at stage 3 can assimilate the two intermediate relations (blue-yellow and yellow-red) within a structure (such as that illustrated in fig. 2) that determines the final relation (blue-red).",,
14,Coordinating Units at the CandyDepot - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In assessing students units coordinating activity, we can use several variations of the bars task. For example, if we want to dissuade students from looking at the bars, we can cover the bars before asking the final question. Alternatively, we can use bars that do not actually fit in the number of times specified and ask students to pretend by asking, Pretend the blue bar fits into the yellow bar three times and that the yellow bar fits into the red bar four times. How many times would the blue bar have to go into the red bar?",,
15,Coordinating Units at the CandyDepot - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We can ask questions in three different permutations. In addition to the original, we could ask students to determine how many times the blue bar would fit into the yellow bar, based on specified blue-red and yellow-red relations; or to determine how many times the yellow bar would fit into the red bar, based on specified blue-yellow and blue-red relations. We could also adapt the bars task to involve other contexts involving three levels of units. With the CandyDepot app, the context involves placing candy bars into bundles and placing bundles into boxes.",,
16,Coordinating Units at the CandyDepot - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,INTRODUCING CANDYDEPOT,,
17,Coordinating Units at the CandyDepot - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"CandyDepot is an educational game designed by the Learning Transformation Research Group at Virginia Tech, available for free at the iTunes store for use on the iPad. The game supports students development of units coordination toward stages 2 and 3 by engaging them in tasks involving bars, bundles, and boxes. Students begin by dragging m bars into bundles (between 2 and 9 bars per bundle) and n bundles into boxes (between 2 and 9 bundles per box), thus establishing an m-to-1 relation between bundles and boxes (see fig. 4). The goal of the game is to use these units (bars, bundles, and boxes) to satisfy customer orders accurately and efficiently, where efficiency refers to both time and packaging.",,
18,Coordinating Units at the CandyDepot - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
19,Coordinating Units at the CandyDepot - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Customer orders can refer to bars, bundles, or boxes, and can include whole number or fractional units. For example, figure 5 shows an order for six halves of a box. Suppose a student has chosen 2 bars per bundle and 3 bundles per box (as indicated by the numbers below the bundle and box in fig. 5). To satisfy the order, this student might recognize the equivalence of 6 halves and 3 wholes and, thus, drag 3 boxes to the truck before closing it (swiping down on the truck door) and shipping the order. Alternatively, the student might understand a box as containing 3 bundles of 2 bars each, for a total of 6 bars per box. Then half a box would be 3 bars, and 6 halves would be 18 bars. With 6 bars in each box, the order would require 3 boxes. The two approaches lead to the same accurate and efficiently packaged solution, using just 3 units (boxes) to complete the order. The former approach would be quicker and easier in this case, but students will need to develop flexible strategies (and rely on various units coordinations) to efficiently fill all orders.",,
20,Coordinating Units at the CandyDepot - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
21,Coordinating Units at the CandyDepot - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"At Level 2 of the game, customer orders no longer accommodate students choices for bundling and boxing. For example, a student might have chosen to put 5 bars in each bundle and 7 bundles in each box, but customer orders might include 19/2 of a bundle or 19/3 of a box, which are orders that would be impossible to fill, given the students choices for boxing and bundling. Therefore, the student will need to rebundle or rebox by long-pressing the bundle or box (holding a finger on them for a few seconds). Because rebundling and reboxing take time, students will learn to make choices for bundling and boxing that can be used to satisfy multiple orders (see the clipboard with the order forecast in fig. 6).",,
22,Coordinating Units at the CandyDepot - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
23,Coordinating Units at the CandyDepot - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Seeing the three upcoming orders on the clipboard (36/4 boxes, 19/2 bundles, and 19/3 boxes), students might recognize that the first order is equivalent to a whole number order (9 boxes); however, the second and third orders require careful planning. To satisfy the second order, the student will need to bundle bars in such a way that he or she can take half a bundle; to satisfy the third order, the student will need to box bundles in such a way that 1/3 box results. Thus, if the student chooses an even number for bundling and a multiple of 3 for boxing, he or she could satisfy all three orders. Learning to anticipate such productions is an important part of students progress toward higher stages of units coordination.",,
24,Coordinating Units at the CandyDepot - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,IMPLEMENTATION IN THE CLASSROOM,,
25,Coordinating Units at the CandyDepot - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"CandyDepot addresses several Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSI 2010) associated with fractions knowledge and multiplicative reasoning, including the following:",,
26,Coordinating Units at the CandyDepot - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Interpret a multiplication equation as a comparison, e.g., interpret 35 = 5  7 as a statement that 35 is 5 times as many as 7 and 7 times as many as 5. Represent verbal statements of multiplicative comparisons as multiplication equations. (p. 29) (4.OA.A.1)",,
27,Coordinating Units at the CandyDepot - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Apply and extend previous understandings of multiplication to multiply a fraction or whole number by a fraction. (p. 30) (5.NF.4),,
28,Coordinating Units at the CandyDepot - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Use ratio reasoning to convert measurement units; manipulate and transform units appropriately when multiplying or dividing quantities. (p. 42) (6.RP.1.D),,
29,Coordinating Units at the CandyDepot - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Although this list includes standards for grades 46, many students reach middle school and continue on without achieving them. Moreover, these standards represent the kind of prerequisite knowledge that students need to develop algebraic reasoning (Hackenberg and Lee 2015).",,
30,Coordinating Units at the CandyDepot - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Jennifer Hatch (the third author) has been using CandyDepot to remediate fractions knowledge and multiplicative reasoning with her seventh-grade students while preparing them for algebra. She could have used the app as part of a Response to Intervention program, with an instructional intervention for individual seventh-grade students who continue to struggle with fractions and multiplicative reasoning. However, she found that her entire class benefited from the kinds of units coordinating activity that the game promotes.",,
31,Coordinating Units at the CandyDepot - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Hatch introduced CandyDepot through a whole-class discussion about units. She led this discussion while demonstrating game play. Students generally understood 1 as a unit, but through bundling and boxing, they began to visualize how even a unit of 1 can contain other units. (In particular, 1 box is a unit containing n bundles, and 1 bundle is a unit containing m bars.) Once the class had chosen how many bars to put in each bundle and how many bundles to put in each box, the teacher asked the class how many bars would be in each box. Hatch found that this dialogue oriented students toward considering various levels of units, and after 10 or 15 minutes most students were ready to play.",,
32,Coordinating Units at the CandyDepot - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"After the first day, Hatch typically asked students to play individually or in pairs for 15 to 20 minutes, twice per week. For the first few days of game play, students created journal entries, illustrating how they bundled and boxed units. They drew pictures and wrote a few sentences about how they used these units to satisfy customer orders (see fig. 7). This was done with the timer turned off (an option on the main menu), so that students did not have to rush. Students who continued to struggle were paired with other students so they could learn from their peers, and game play was always followed by whole-class discussion (about 5 minutes), so that students could share what they learned. For Hatchs classes, the most productive class discussions were about different ways to satisfy customer orders and why certain ways were more efficient than others.",,
33,Coordinating Units at the CandyDepot - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
34,Coordinating Units at the CandyDepot - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Within four weeks, students were able to play Level 1 successfully. Most of them no longer needed to draw bundles and boxes to visualize relationships among the units. Henceforth, students worked with the timer to build greater efficiency and facility; students used the timer to compete with each other and themselves. During this work, the teacher noticed changes in students reasoning.",,
35,Coordinating Units at the CandyDepot - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"As an example of one students reasoning, consider how Janelle satisfied a customer order for 59 bars, having put 3 bars in a bundle and 2 bundles in a box. Janelle created a multiplication table to determine that 59 divided by 6 would yield 9 full boxes, which would give her 54 of the 59 bars needed; now she needed 5/6 of a box (see fig. 7). Janelle circled 5 of the 6 bars on her paper and, within them, saw that 3 bars were equal to 1 bundle and 2 extra bars. Thus, she shipped 9 boxes, 1 bundle, and 2 bars.",,
36,Coordinating Units at the CandyDepot - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"As such, Janelles activity indicates that she was beginning to coordinate three levels of units, using Candy-Depot and her drawings to help: First, she coordinated 54 as nine 6s; then she coordinated 5/6 as five 1/6s (bars), subsequently identifying 3 of these as a bundle. Thus, CandyDepot seemed to support her development toward stage 3 of the units coordination (see table 1).",,
37,Coordinating Units at the CandyDepot - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,AN APP DESIGNED TO HELP FRACTION KNOWLEDGE,,
38,Coordinating Units at the CandyDepot - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"CandyDepot is an educational game designed to address the critical need for students to develop units coordination. With proper implementationincluding opportunities for reflection and discussionteachers can use the app to support students units coordination activity across multiple contexts, including fractions knowledge and multiplicative reasoning (Boyce and Norton, under review). At the same time, teachers will be preparing students for algebra (Ellis 2007; Hackenberg and Lee 2015).
