"Have you encountered this situation? When students work with data, a number of concepts must be sorted out. By sixth grade, not only should students be able to “recognize the differences in representing categorical  and numerical data” (NCTM 2000,  p. 400), they also need to “use measures of center, focusing on the median, and understand what each does and does not indicate about a data set” (p. 400). These two goals interact; students have to sort out issues about which measures of center are appropriate to use to describe, summarize, and compare distributions of different kinds of data.

"selection of measures of center to describe data. We focus, in particular, on the interplay between categorical and numerical data and the use of the median.  thinking about categorical data",10,mtms2009-02-344a,,
"In our work with middle school students and statistics, we ask students to focus on distinguishing between two types of data: numerical and categorical. Numerical measurements may involve continuous data, such as height or temperature, or discrete data, often occurring as counts, such as the number of children in a family, and can be readily ordered from smallest to largest and used with operations such as addition or subtraction",11,mtms2009-02-344a,,
"Categorical variables, however, may be either nominal data or ordinal data. As nominal data, names are assigned  to objects as labels based on some category definition, such as favorite kinds of pets (e.g., dog, cat, hamster, etc.); the data values are the nonnumeric group labels. There is no natural ordering to these data. Ordinal data (i.e., ordinal categorical data values) can be ordered, but operations such as addition and subtraction are meaningless. These data may be ranked in some numerically meaningful way. For example, strongly disagree to strongly agree may be defined as 1 to 5 where the numbers represent (1) strongly agree, (2) agree, (3) neutral, (4) disagree, or (5) strongly disagree.  ",12,mtms2009-02-344a,,
"Students may struggle with the  distinctions between categorical data and numerical data when category labels use numbers as labels (see fig. 1). In the middle grades, categorical data are often treated as being synonymous  the midpoint of a distribution of data. However, the median cannot be used to summarize categorical data, such as favorite ice cream flavors. Finding a midpoint of these data is not possible.  sorting out the Median and categorical data We worked with a middle-grades teacher who was using a statistics unit, Data about Us (Lappan et al. 2006), with two sixth-grade classes. This unit is intended to tie together the data analysis content that is addressed in elementary school, but it can also serve to develop ideas if students have not yet had sufficient experiences exploring data. ",13,mtms2009-02-344a,,
"Early in the unit, both mode and median are reviewed. Activities are designed to help students understand what the median is, how to find it, and how it might be influenced by data values in a distribution. Students are given a set of numbers, representing the number of letters in each of the names of a group of students. They find the median of the data using a model that involves a paper strip marked with square grids. Each numerical value (name length) in the  data set is arranged in order from least to greatest, with each data value written on one square (see fig. 2) of the paper strip. Students can fold the strip in half to locate the midpoint or the median. Although it takes its value from the data, the median, as a marker, that shows the midpoint of the distribution, is not a data value itself. ",14,mtms2009-02-344a,,
"Figure 2a displays an odd (21)  number of data values recorded on a paper strip. When the paper is folded in half, the crease is over the number 12, which locates the median. Students also explore what happens when a data set contains an even number of data values. In the example in figure 2b, the additional value of 19 letters is included in these data. The strip shows an even (22) number of data values, and the fold is between 12 letters and 13 letters. The median is determined by computing the mean of these two values; in this case, the midpoint of the distribution, or median, is 12.5 letters, marking a location between two data values that is not a possible data value, itself.",15,mtms2009-02-344a,,

thinking about the Median,20,mtms2009-02-344a,,
"The median is one possible measure of central tendency used to summarize data. The median divides a set of data into two equal-sized groups (Konold and Pollatsek 2004, p. 179). It marks the midpoint of a distribution of data values; its computation takes the form of ordering the data values from smallest to largest and then identifying the midpoint in these data (see fig. 2). Although the median is a relatively simple measure to identify, research studies and large-scale assessments of students’ mathematical knowledge indicate that understanding the median is far more complex than we might realize (Bakker 2004; Cobb, McClain, and Gravemeijer 2003; Konold and Higgins 2003; Zawojewski and Shaughnessy 2000a, 2000b). ",21,mtms2009-02-344a,,
"The situation presented at the  beginning of this article highlights the need to help students understand that the median is not a suitable measure to use to summarize categorical data that are nominal data.

"numerical data (see fig. 1). This introduction includes a number of questions that might be asked about these data. Students identify whether the answers to the questions take the form of categories or numbers. These prompts highlight issues, such as the classification of categorical data in the question, Who is your favorite author? Other questions involve numerical data as elicited by the question, How many movies have you watched in the past week?  sorting out the  use oF Median with categorical data",25,mtms2009-02-344a,,
The teacher anticipated the discussion that might occur while analyzing data collected in response to two questions (see fig. 3):  1.  What is your favorite kind of pet? 2.  How many pets do you have? ,26,mtms2009-02-344a,,
"From past experiences, the teacher was aware that his students entered this problem without formalizing the distinction between data types and without questioning whether the median could be used for all data types. In addition to the questions posed, students were provided with both the table and bar graph representations of each data set. Students, when investigating this problem, entered into discussions about finding the median of favorite kinds of pets. The teacher’s anticipation of these discussions was on target.",27,mtms2009-02-344a,,
"The students’ struggles suggested  a need to provide some problem or discussion that helps clarify the  distinctions between categorical and numerical data types and their relationships to the median. The teacher decided to have his students answer the two questions posed in the problem, collecting data from their classmates before they worked on the data presented in the text. ",28,mtms2009-02-344a,,
"Once the classroom data were collected, he asked students to construct a bar graph for each of their data sets and to find the mode, range, and median for each. The teacher knew that he was asking students to complete an impossible task, since neither the median nor the range is used with categorical data. His rationale was that the students essentially created this situation for themselves while working on the problem. He chose to  bring to their attention the distinction in data before they started to work on the problem from the text. ",29,mtms2009-02-344a,,
"As the teacher expected, several  students attempted to find the median of categorical data. Incorrect approaches provided either a numerical value or a categorical value for the median.",30,mtms2009-02-344a,,
"Responses presenting a numerical median usually arose from students finding the median of the frequencies associated with each of the kinds of pets. For example, using the reported frequencies for favorite kinds of pets in the original problem (fig. 3), the data were 4 (cats), 7 (dogs), 2 (fish), 2 (birds), 3 (horses), 1 (goat), 2 (cows), 3 (rabbits), 1 (duck), and 1 (pig). In this situation, students appeared to confuse frequencies with data; the data were kinds of pets but, using frequencies (i.e., 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 7), students found that the median is 2. ",31,mtms2009-02-344a,,
"Responses that provided a categorical median incorporated a variety of approaches to ordering the categorical data. For example, some students ordered the data alphabetically: bird, cat, cow, dog, duck, horse, fish, goat, pig, and rabbit but were confused when the median was identified as “duck or horse.” Another approach involved finding the median of the frequencies associated with each type of pet, then identifying the median as being any data values associated with 2 (i.e., fish, bird, or cow). In the following excerpt, Carl attempted to find the median of the categories as they appeared on his bar graph. Another student, Paul, suggested that the data can be ordered by writing them in a list where the data were ordered by frequency with the low frequency categories listed first. ",32,mtms2009-02-344a,,
Teacher: I saw you guys counting the bars. So your median would be where?,33,mtms2009-02-344a,,

"Carl: Yes, a fird! [Everyone laughs.]",36,mtms2009-02-344a,,
Teacher: . . . Between a bird and a fish! ,37,mtms2009-02-344a,,
Can you really compute some value that is between a bird and a fish?,38,mtms2009-02-344a,,
Carl: No.,39,mtms2009-02-344a,,
Teacher: What kind of data are we looking at? Numerical or categorical?,40,mtms2009-02-344a,,
Paul: Categorical.,41,mtms2009-02-344a,,
Teacher: Categorical data. And to get  the median—that means you have to do what with all your data? To find the median what is the first thing you have to do?,42,mtms2009-02-344a,,
Paul: I know. You have to put them in  order. Like . . . like. . . .  categorical data can be ordered in a meaningful way. ,43,mtms2009-02-344a,,
"Focusing on ordering The teacher took time to emphasize the importance of ordering data when finding the median. He asked students to find the median of numerical data. He then referred to the Favorite Kinds of Pets task and asked whether categorical data relating to pets can be ordered. Many students claimed that it could. Two different understandings emerged about how the categorical data could be ordered: alphabetically (e.g., bird, cat, dog, fish) and by frequency (e.g., fish, cat, cat, dog, dog, dog, etc.). For the latter grouping, the teacher suggested that these orderings indicate that the animals placed at the beginning of the list are “less than” the animals following it—as is the case with numerical data. When the class considered this ordering of animals, many conceded that categorical data cannot be ordered. The teacher encouraged students to think about the ramifications this had for calculating certain statistics. Students concluded that they could not calculate the median or range for categorical data. ",44,mtms2009-02-344a,,
Focusing on generating  a data set,45,mtms2009-02-344a,,
"In a second approach to helping students understand the concept of the median, the teacher asked students to create a data set when provided with the median:   Produce a 5 member data set that has a median of 14. ",46,mtms2009-02-344a,,
Students were then asked if it would be possible to generate a data set given the categorical median: ,47,mtms2009-02-344a,,
"Paul continued to list the animals in arbitrary order for the teacher. His thinking validated the claim that students were confused about whether   If you know that the median animal in a data set of 5 animals is a chicken, can you determine a set of data that has 4 other animals?  unpacking essential understandings",48,mtms2009-02-344a,,
"We often assume that middle-grades students have had a variety of experiences with collecting and representing data. however, important distinctions about data reduction may not be clear. We collect data to answer a question. For example, middle-grades students may be interested in information about pets. two questions posed in this article deal with this interest:  • What is your favorite kind of pet? • how many pets do you have?",49,mtms2009-02-344a,,
Data collected in response to either question may be in a form that makes analysis hard to do. Reducing data to interpret the results and establish the patterns involves organizing and analyzing data for greater clarity. Included as part of datareduction efforts is the need to understand types of data so that helpful representations and statistical analyses can be chosen.,50,mtms2009-02-344a,,
the two questions above provide opportunities for students to sort  out a variety of essential understandings that are the foundations of data analysis. We suggest a process for exploring each question that will help highlight these essential understandings.,51,mtms2009-02-344a,,
"1. Collecting data: Each student will have an initial answer for each of the two questions posed. So that students can see that each data value is linked to a student, we suggest using a recording sheet that has each student’s name listed in a column, along with two additional columns, one for each student’s response to each of the two questions. often when we collect data from students in our classes, we do so without connecting them explicitly as a case (i.e., the student and his or her response—choice of favorite kind of pet for each student, categorical data, and number of pets, numerical data—to each of the two questions). Using a recording sheet, we highlight both the source and the data as a case.  2. Visual scanning: An initial analysis can be done visually by scanning the data for each case. What do students notice about favorite pets? Are many different choices possible or are many of the choices the same? What do students notice about the numbers of pets? What are the fewest numbers of pets? (that answer will probably be zero.) What are the greatest numbers of pets? 3. Ordering data: We will want to highlight distinctions between categorical and numerical data. the next logical step is to consider if the responses to each question can be placed in some kind of order. Data for numbers of pets do have an order. We know that a student who has two pets has more than a student having one pet. Data about favorite pets do not have an order. however, as can be seen from this article, it is not clear that students understand that there is no order to favorite-pet data. By examining the data before they are organized by frequencies, it is possible to sort out the issues related to ordering so as to establish that categorical data do not have a numerical order. Attempts at order before organizing data by frequencies help keep the focus on the data values.",52,mtms2009-02-344a,,
"4. Organizing and representing data: think about ways to organize these data. Both the use of frequency tables and graphs are needed. Students organize each set of data in a table that shows frequencies of occurrences for each data value. the first column is the data value and the second column is the frequency of occurrence (how many times the data value is repeated) of that data value in the data distribution. For data about numbers of pets, a discussion is needed about including more than the data values from the collected data as part of the data-value column (number of pets); we need to highlight those data values for which we collected no data as well because these are ordered data. the same situation is not true for favorite pets. Students can use the tables to construct the bar graphs, seeing the link between the two representations for each data distribution. ",53,mtms2009-02-344a,,
It is important for students to have a solid foundation of essential understandings for data analysis. Students need many opportunities to work with data to build such a solid foundation.,54,mtms2009-02-344a,,
"This task highlighted the need to  generate ordered data and put students in the position of determining a method to order categorical data. Knowing one data value in a distribution of categorical data does not indicate what other possible elements of the data set might be or in what order they might occur. Following this discussion, most students had little trouble explaining why you cannot find the median of categorical data. The following excerpt highlighted one particular student who was grappling with the concept and the comments made by other students.",55,mtms2009-02-344a,,
Teacher: Can we predict the other  animals?,56,mtms2009-02-344a,,
Paul: Two pigs on the left of the  chicken.,57,mtms2009-02-344a,,
"Teacher: Okay, I am going to do it. I am going to put two pigs on the left—pig pig chicken.",58,mtms2009-02-344a,,
Paul: And then two sheep on the right—pig pig chicken sheep sheep.,59,mtms2009-02-344a,,
"Students: [Murmuring] No, it is not  possible.",60,mtms2009-02-344a,,
"Paul: And then if those were in order like that—to find the middle, it would be chicken.",61,mtms2009-02-344a,,
Teacher: Do you guys all agree?,62,mtms2009-02-344a,,
Jessie: No. There is no median because  you can’t put them in order . . . from smallest to largest values.,63,mtms2009-02-344a,,
"assessing students’ understanding The next day, the teacher posed a task to assess whether students better understood the relationship between the use of the median and data type. In the following excerpt, the teacher presented students with a categorical data value, such as a dolphin, and asked if it was possible to construct a five-member data set with this dolphin as a “median.” ",64,mtms2009-02-344a,,
"For the students who tended to focus on ordering (first approach),  several understood that it was not possible to construct a data set around a “categorical median.” They explained why such a median in the following dialogue was not possible. ",65,mtms2009-02-344a,,
Tasha: Because you have to have a  number . . . for the median. For the median you have to have numbers.,66,mtms2009-02-344a,,
Linda: One has to be greater than the other. Like the number 1 is bigger than 0.,67,mtms2009-02-344a,,
"Some students continued to struggle with the concept, and many invoked strategies that allowed them to order the data numerically. For example, how to order creatures found in the sea, such as a whale, shark, octopus, and sea bass, were discussed.",68,mtms2009-02-344a,,
Allen: We could use the numbers of  letters in their name.,69,mtms2009-02-344a,,
"Teacher: Use the number of letters, and I want to argue about the length of the animals so I have a third category I want to look at. I want to look at their lengths or I want to look at how many of them there are in the ocean. That’s what I want to work with. Can we really order animals?",70,mtms2009-02-344a,,
"Students: No, because the shark isn’t  better than the sea bass or the sea bass better than the octopus.",71,mtms2009-02-344a,,
"Students who used the median to generate a data set (second approach) did not seem to have as much difficulty with the concept as their peers in the other group. When the teacher claimed that he wanted the median to be dolphin, students protested. One student said that the data were categorical and cannot be put in order. Another student elaborated by saying that there was no way to find the range, although the mode could be found if they could determine how many of each category there were.  interViewing students about the Median oF categorical data",72,mtms2009-02-344a,,

"Research indicates that students’ understanding of the median is far more complex than we might realize ing and learning of statistics at the middle-grades levels became apparent.   1.  The types of tasks we use and the  questions we ask determine the activities that engage students. For example, asking students to find the median of a set of categorical data probably suggests that this task is possible. We cannot, then, be surprised when students attempt to complete it.  2.  Merely telling students that categorical data cannot be described using the median is not sufficient to help students understand and reason about data or to explain why particular measures are suitable for particular types of data. (See the sidebar on p. 349 for more information.)  3.  Students appear to have trouble distinguishing frequency counts from data values. Once data are collected, the next task involves data reduction, such as finding a way to group data so that the patterns of the data emerge. For students, numbers are data, whether they represent frequency or data values, and they become confused with sorting out what data are being analyzed.",89,mtms2009-02-344a,,
The statistical ideas presented in  this article are complex. Developing a robust understanding of data requires providing opportunities for students to engage in data analysis tasks and in discussion. Statistical ideas will need   to be revisited periodically and in a variety of different contexts to ensure that students have a solid understanding of statistics. ,90,mtms2009-02-344a,,
