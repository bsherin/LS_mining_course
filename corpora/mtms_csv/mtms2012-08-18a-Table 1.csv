"Sleeping Brilliantly 1. If today is a Monday, 7 days from  now will also be a Monday—as it will be 14, 21, 28, and so on, days from now. If today is Monday, what day of the week will it be— 3. Marcella makes a monthly   mortgage payment. Starting next month, she has to make 187 more house payments to completely pay off her home loan. In what month will the loan be paid off?   a. 10 days from today?   b. 19 days from today? 4. What time will it be 23 hours from  now?",3,mtms2012-08-18a,,
"CHallenge 7. Each year of the Chinese calendar is represented by 1 of 12 animals of the Chinese zodiac. This pattern is followed: Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Goat, Monkey, Rooster, Dog, and Boar. The year 2000 was the Year of the Dragon, so 2001 was the Year of the Snake. Predict which animal represents the following years: c. 100 days from today?  from now? 5. What time will it be 237 hours    a. 2100    d.  1 year from today? (Remember  6. If Peter follows the sleeping sched-   b. 3000  to consider leap years.) 2. Anh makes a monthly car payment. Starting next month, she must make 27 more payments to pay off her car loan. In what month will the loan be paid off?  ule he describes in the cartoon, will he wake at 6:30 a.m. on the first day of school? Note that the cartoon appeared in a Sunday newspaper.",4,mtms2012-08-18a,,

"SolutionS 1.  a.  It will be 3 days past Monday, so  it will be a Thursday.",7,mtms2012-08-18a,,
"b.  Since 19 ÷ 7 = 2 remainder 5, it will be 5 days past Monday (or 7 – 5 = 2 days before Monday), or a Saturday.",8,mtms2012-08-18a,,
"c.  Since 100 ÷ 7 = 14 remainder 2, it will be 2 days past Monday, or a Wednesday.",9,mtms2012-08-18a,,
"  d.  Since 365 ÷ 7 = 52 remainder  1, it will be 1 day past Monday, or a Tuesday. If a February 29 occurs between today and 1 year from today, it will be 2 days after Monday (366 ÷ 7 = 52 remainder 2), or a Wednesday.",10,mtms2012-08-18a,,
"2.  Answers will vary, depending on the month the activity is carried out. Since 27 months is 2 full years plus 3 months, it will be 3 months later in the year than the month of the first payment. If Anh makes the first payment in January, the car will be paid off in March (27 ÷ 12 = 2 remainder 3, or 2 years and 3 months later).",11,mtms2012-08-18a,,
"3.  Answers will vary, depending on the month the activity is carried  out. Since 187 months is 15 full years plus 7 months, it will be 7 months later in the year than the month of the first payment. If Marcella makes the first payment in January, her mortgage will be paid off in July (187 ÷ 12 = 15 remainder 7, or 15 years and 7 months later).",12,mtms2012-08-18a,,
"4.  Answers will vary, depending on  the hour the activity is carried out. Since there are 24 hours in a day, 23 hours from the present will be  1 hour earlier in the day.  5.  Answers will vary, depending on  the hour the activity is carried out. Since there are 24 hours in a day, 237 ÷ 24 = 9 remainder 21. Thus, it will be 21 hours later (or 3 hours earlier) in the day. Students may also notice that 10 × 24 = 240, so 237 hours would be 3 hours earlier in the day.",13,mtms2012-08-18a,,

"Sunday, Peter’s plan will work. On Sunday, he will rise at 1:00 p.m.; on Monday, at 3:30 p.m.; on  Tuesday, at 6 p.m.; on Wednesday, at 8:30 p.m.; and on Thursday,  at 11 p.m.; 2.5 hours after 11 p.m. means that he will rise on Saturday  at 1:30 a.m.; on Sunday, at  4:00 a.m.; and on Monday, at 6:30 a.m.",15,mtms2012-08-18a,,

"Dragon, 12 years later (2012) will also be the Year of the Dragon—as will 2024, 2036, and so on (i.e., any multiple of 12 added to 2000 will be the Year of the Dragon). Thus, 2096 will be the Year of the Dragon but 4 years later will be the Year of the Monkey.",17,mtms2012-08-18a,,
"b.  Similarly, the year 3000 is   1000 years after the year 2000, and 1000 ÷ 12 = 83 remainder 4. The year 3000 will be 4 years after the Year of the Dragon. The year 3000 will be the  Year of the Monkey. Going backward in time works in  the same way.  c.  The year 1000 was 4 years before  the Year of the Dragon (since 83 × 12 = 996; 996 years before 2000 will be the Year of the Dragon). Therefore, 1000 was the Year of the Rat.",18,mtms2012-08-18a,,

"For many of my seventh-grade and eighth-grade algebra students, this cartoon was their introduction to the FoxTrot family. We spent time discussing the situation in the cartoon and sharing personal experiences of family rituals leading up to the first day of school. Then volunteers enacted the strip, and the classes debated the feasibility of Peter’s idea. We organized his proposal in a data table, and students decided that, although his  suggestion would work mathematically, it was not practical.",20,mtms2012-08-18a,,
"Some were initially confused by the list of days with times because it showed Peter rising at 11:00 p.m.  on Thursday and then again just  2 1/2 hours later at 1:30 a.m., Friday morning. After further discussion, students realized that they would logically skip over to Saturday. Each class worked through the first question together, some students admitting that they find this kind of question  difficult. Most preferred dividing by seven and using the remainder to count further. Some students in each class liked going to the next multiple of seven and counting back. Then they completed the remainder of the questions with a partner. ",21,mtms2012-08-18a,,
"The digital age has made developing a sense of elapsed time more difficult, in that students cannot watch the minute hand circle the clock’s face. This issue becomes even more evident when a calendar page simply flips to  the next month. This high-interest activity provided a good opportunity to practice a skill that we assume students can manage but often cannot. Pamela Haner",22,mtms2012-08-18a,,

"My fifth graders said that this Cartoon	Corner	math	was	“so	easy”	 because they understood the concept of time and patterns—or so they thought. They did a great job and were very accurate until they hit the wall with the challenge questions. They had meaningful discussions among themselves while working through the problems. I have not taught elapsed time this year, so this material was strictly a review of what they retained from last year in math.",25,mtms2012-08-18a,,
"They were engaged in the assignment the entire time and discussed with their elbow partners how best to determine the answers to the questions. They were excited to find that, usually, their elbow partners were solving the problems in the same manner as they were. But many had opposing opinions about how to correctly	solve	the	Challenge	question.",26,mtms2012-08-18a,,
"As a teacher, hearing mathematical discussions during class that included so much rich math vocabulary was	exciting.	The	Challenge	question	 also seemed to motivate reluctant communicators to speak out. They were very animated in their defense of their answers and used every persuasive idea they could imagine to convince their elbow partners to agree with them. I loved seeing this in class and wish I had videotaped it! Tina Gay",27,mtms2012-08-18a,,

"I used this cartoon with my seventh graders. Two classes were honors prealgebra students and one class was team-taught using an inclusion  model. The problem was presented to students, and a brief explanation of the task was given. Students were then allowed to work individually or in small groups. There were numerous strategies for question 1: counting, using a calendar, counting on from part a for part b, counting backward from the next highest multiple of seven, and dividing and using the remainder to calculate. The more sophisticated the strategy, the easier the remaining questions were to answer.",30,mtms2012-08-18a,,

"Friday,	so	“assume	today	is	Monday”	 caused trouble for a few students. I also had to emphasize that the next month was the first month of the payment plan. Teachers also need to be sure to point out that the cartoon is from a Sunday newspaper and that therefore the conversation between mom and son occurs on a Sunday.",32,mtms2012-08-18a,,
"My students felt that this problem was of an appropriate difficulty level for middle schoolers. Younger students, they felt, would need more support and guidance, but they thought that older students (seventh and eighth grade) should be able to complete it independently or with minor assistance.",33,mtms2012-08-18a,,

"Kamii and Kelly A. Russell, which appeared in the May 2012 issue of the Journal for Research in Mathematics Education, pp. 296-315. Kamii and Russell noted that the main reason found to explain students’ difficulties understanding elapsed time involved an inability to coordinate hierarchical units, such as hours and minutes.) otHer ideaS •	 Have	students	investigate	 remainders. For example, if they divide any three consecutive numbers by 3, the remainders will be 0, 1, and 2 (not necessarily in that order). If they divide any six consecutive numbers  by 6, the remainders will be  0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 (not necessarily in that order). Introduce students to modular arithmetic, a common version of which is clock arithmetic.  •	 Make	“math	task	cards”	in	 which students find patterns and strategically calculate the answers. A quick-check system or a class tally chart can be used to show which students have these concepts down pat.  •	 Use	a	Chinese	calendar	during	the	Chinese	New	Year	to	 predict certain animal years, capture students’ attention, and provide them with meaningful discussion points. These points could be addressed in math journals.",38,mtms2012-08-18a,,
"•	 Ask	students	to	calculate	on	 which day of the week they were born. They should show their work in their math journals. The following website  can ensure that the students have the correct day of the  week for their birth date:  http://www.fi.edu/time/ Journey/OnceUponATime/ dayofweekbirth.htm.  •	 Discuss	why	birthdays	  occur 1 day later each year  (365/7, remainder 1) and 2  days later in leap years. Discuss leap year—why it happens  every 4 years and why we do  not just ignore that extra bit  of time. ",39,mtms2012-08-18a,,
