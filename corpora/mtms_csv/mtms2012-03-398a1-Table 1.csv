Relatively Speaking,4,mtms2012-03-398a1,,
"Terry’s teacher was talking about relatively prime numbers.  The example being discussed involved 8 natural numbers  that were relatively prime to 15 and less than 15  (1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 11, 13, 14). Terry wondered: a.  How many natural numbers less than 100 were relatively  prime to 15? b.  How many natural numbers between 43 and 274 were   relatively prime to 15? c.  How could you determine how many natural numbers  were relatively prime to 15 between any pair of natural numbers, a and b?  solve it! solutions (Continued from p. 398)  a. 53   b. 125   c. Answers will vary.",5,mtms2012-03-398a1,,
