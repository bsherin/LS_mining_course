2,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities,"The standards described in the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSM) are currently a major infl uence in the United States on how content is articulated across the middle grades (CCSSI 2010). Interpreting specifi c standards, however, is not a straightforward affair, and CCSSM authors are agnostic with regard to instructional approaches that should be used to address particular standards. In this article, we explore possible interpretations of the following statement (CCSSI 2010, p. 48): ",2,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities
3,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities,"Understand subtraction of rational numbers as adding the additive inverse, p – q = p + (–q). Show that the distance between two rational numbers on the number line is the absolute value of their difference, and apply this principle in real-world contexts.

5,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities,"U.S. middle school teachers to emphasize procedures, one possible interpretation of this standard would be to direct students to transform subtraction problems into addition problems. Often, a mnemonic like “keep-changechange” is taught before students have had a chance to explore subtraction. For example, the calculation 3 – 7 would be transformed to 3 + (–7), in which the sign of the fi rst number stays the same (keep), the operation changes from subtraction to addition (change), and the sign of the second number changes (change). ",5,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities
6,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities,"Following this road map, teachers would model the procedure and then ask students to practice independently  the keep-change-change approach. However, using keep-change-change would largely avoid opportunities for students to fi rst make sense of subtraction with rational numbers or to make connections to ideas related to subtraction. This is at odds with the second part of the standard, which connects subtraction to fi nding the distance between two numbers on a number line. Distance is seen as always having a positive, or absolute, value. This distinguishes it from the more comprehensive case of vectors,  which can take on both magnitude and sign. Considering subtraction in terms of either distance or vector length provides opportunities for students to connect actions in a visual space to operations on numbers. ",6,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities
7,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities,"The value of directing students to use keep-change-change is that it reduces the time and complexity required to teach rational number addition and subtraction. Although effi cient and accurate computation is a desirable goal, focusing strictly on keep-changechange has drawbacks. It restricts  opportunities for students to reason about rational number computation.",7,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities
8,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities,"As will be shown below, students’ reasoning about rational numbers is not always effi cient or accurate, but their reasoning reveals the complex and idiosyncratic ways in which students make sense of mathematics. Consequently, approaches that elicit student reasoning provide indicators of the connections and meanings that students assign to mathematical procedures. However, an approach focused on student reasoning in this case means ",8,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities
9,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities,The complex and sometimes cumbersome ways that students think about mathematics are catalysts for deeper learning of mathematics.,9,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities
10,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities,We illustrate the various ways that students reasoned about rational number computation and how they conjectured about properties of rational numbers. These rich opportunities for thinking would have been constrained if the teachers had simply introduced the keep-change-change approach.,10,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities
11,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities,We begin by briefl y describing the activities that led to the development of algorithms and then analyze the algorithms produced by the students. ,11,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities
12,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities,"EMPHASIZING EMERGENT CONJECTURES From the beginning of the instructional sequence, the teachers noticed that the students were talking about patterns related to adding and subtracting rational numbers in a number of different problem contexts. The fi rst context was the Math Fever Game, set in a game show context, in which teams won or lost points on the basis of whether team members answered questions correctly. Student teams worked with 50, 100, 150, 200, or 250 points. Although the students had not been formally introduced to rational number computation, they were asked to generate number sentences for various point totals, which included negative totals. All the students had heard of negative numbers and intuitively began operating with them. ",12,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities
13,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities,"In the second task, From Sauna to Snowbank, students calculated differences in temperatures using an image of a thermometer, which served as an informal way to introduce the number line. In the third task, What’s the Change? students worked more formally with the number line to calculate temperature changes that could be positive or negative (e.g., the tempera- ture could rise from –10 degrees to 40 degrees or it could drop from 20 degrees to –30 degrees). It should be noted that students began by working with rational numbers in real-world contexts as a way to generate patterns and algorithms for more abstract calculations. ",13,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities
14,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities,"The teachers observed that, while working on these tasks, students intuitively began to form conjectures about patterns they had noticed. The teachers provided an outlet for expressing and discussing those conjectures before students began formal attempts at developing algorithms. As students’ conjectures were posted on an electronic white board, teachers asked the class to discuss them. This process helped students refi ne their language, establish standards of evidence, and focus on patterns that were useful later when developing algorithms. Examples of these early student conjectures included the following: allowing students to develop their own algorithms for rational number addition and subtraction. This route is more complex, more time-consuming, and has less certain outcomes, which all require different commitments of time and content coverage. ",14,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities
15,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities,"We describe how writing algorithms provided opportunities for students to make sense of rational number addition and subtraction. We show the range and complexity of student thinking related to the computation of rational numbers that are manifest in student-developed algorithms. We also illustrate what a commitment to sense making looks like in practice, especially with regard to the complex and sometimes cumbersome ways that students think about mathematics, which we argue are catalysts for deeper learning of mathematics. The authors are a team of two teachers and a researcher who for several years have studied the teachers’ enactment of Accentuate the Negative, a unit on rational numbers that is part of the Connected Mathematics Project (CMP) curriculum (Lappan et al. 2006). We show how allowing students to create algorithms provided opportunities for them to reason about rational number addition and subtraction. In the process, students developed sensible ways to compute with rational numbers and to understand key terms such as absolute value.  1.  “When you add a negative and a positive number, the answer is negative if the bigger number  is negative.”  2.  “When you add a negative number,  it’s the same as subtracting.” 3.  “When you are subtracting a positive, it’s always going to go lower.” 4.  “When you are subtracting nega- tives, you will always get positives.”",15,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities
16,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities,"The teachers used the conjectures  to refine students’ language, particularly about absolute value. They found that many of the conjectures were ambiguous or incorrect because students did not distinguish between the relative and absolute values of the numbers. For example, in the first conjecture above, the student referred to the negative number as possibly being the “bigger” number, without stating whether that meant greater (farther to the right on the number line) or larger (farther from zero on the number line). Consequently, the teachers used this opportunity to formally define absolute value to help students’ precision.",16,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities
17,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities,MOVING FROM CONJECTURES TO ALGORITHMS,17,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities
18,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities,"The teachers believed that developing algorithms helped students acquire deeper understandings of operations on rational numbers, even for those who were already competent adding and subtracting rational numbers. The teachers explained that the conjectures were not algorithms, in that the conjectures were not comprehensive or detailed enough to describe to someone else how to add or subtract rational numbers. ",18,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities
19,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities,"To begin, teachers implemented an activity to help students become more explicit when describing the steps necessary to add or subtract rational numbers. Students were given eight addition problems, specifically, a pair of problems for each sign combination  (e.g., positive plus a negative, positive plus a positive, negative plus a positive, and negative plus a negative) and asked to create a comprehensive list of cases for rational number addition. They were also asked to describe specific steps for each case. For example, students described the steps for adding a negative plus a negative, in which they described the operations performed on the absolute values of the numbers as well as the sign of the result. The teachers provided feedback on these drafts, marking where steps were inaccurate or where the list of cases was not comprehensive (e.g., missing the case of computing with zero). The students then met in groups to generate a collective algorithm, which allowed them to compare algorithms and decide which ones were the most accurate, sensible, or efficient.",19,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities
20,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities,"The same process was repeated for subtraction. Developing algorithms for subtraction was more complicated; it involved twice the number of possible cases because the commutative property does not hold for subtraction. Similar to the addition task, there were eight problems, specifically, a pair for each sign combination. However, within each sign combination, there were two different cases, one for which the first number had a large absolute value and one for which the second number had a larger absolute value (e.g., –5 – (–7) and –5 – (–2)). Again, the students were asked to create a comprehensive list of cases by whatever patterns or criteria they noticed. As with the addition algorithms, students were given feedback and then asked to create collective versions of the algorithms in groups. ",20,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities
21,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities,"Because subtraction is more complicated, and because standard 7.NS.c could be interpreted as transforming all subtraction to addition, we present examples of students’ subtraction algorithms. The variation in the  algorithms shows a range and complexity of student thinking that would be absent if the teachers had told the students to switch all subtraction problems to addition.

22,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities,STUDENTS’ SUBTRACTION ALGORITHMS,22,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities
23,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities,"Students grouped the subtraction problems into cases in three ways, although these methods were not necessarily used exclusively, as will be shown below:  1.  All subtraction problems could be  changed to addition.  2.  Problems could be grouped according to the signs of their operands (e.g., negative minus a negative, negative minus a positive, and so on).  3.  Problems could be grouped according to the relative order of the operands (e.g., a lesser number minus a greater number and vice versa). ",23,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities
24,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities,"For reasons of space, we will refrain  from discussing cases related to adding or subtracting zero.",24,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities
25,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities,About one-third of the groups  recognized that subtraction problems could simply be changed to addition. These students provided the following two cases:,25,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities
26,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities,Case 1: Subtracting a negative is like adding a positive.,26,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities
27,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities,Case 2: Subtracting a positive is like adding a negative. ,27,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities
28,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities,"Some of these groups, however, broke down the primary cases into subcases, describing the steps for each of the four possible sign combinations. For example, for subtracting a negative from a negative, the group wrote: . . . your answer will be larger. So  take the second negative and add  its opposite with the other number.",28,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities
29,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities,They gave similar descriptions for the other cases. ,29,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities
30,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities,"Other groups changed subtraction to addition only in the cases of unlike signs. Problems with operands of like signs were treated differently. The members of one group made subcases for subtracting a negative from a negative, in which they explicitly considered absolute value to determine the relative size of the numbers. For example, one of their subcases read: ",30,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities
31,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities,"Smaller positive number minus larger positive number. You fl ip-fl op the problem so that the larger number is fi rst and solve the new problem, then put a negative sign in front of the answer. ",31,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities
32,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities,One group using this method  mentioned operations on the absolute values of the operands in three of their cases. An example of one of their cases read:,32,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities
33,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities,"First, make both numbers positive. Then, you subtract the lower absolute value from the higher absolute value. If the fi rst number had the higher absolute value, you have to put a negative sign in front of the answer.",33,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities
34,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities,"Subtracting a negative from a negative. First make both numbers positive. Then, you subtract the lower absolute value from the higher absolute value. You have to put a negative sign in front of the answer.",34,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities
35,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities,"The most popular strategy was to  break the cases down into the four possible sign combinations of the operands and treat those cases distinctly. This strategy was often complemented by dividing some of the cases into subcases, based on if one were subtracting a larger number from a smaller number or vice versa. This was only applied to cases involving operands of like signs. For example, one group wrote: ",35,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities
36,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities,"The students justifi ed the accuracy  of their algorithms in several ways. Some students included diagrams of the number lines in their algorithms to illustrate how a case worked. Other students discussed the chipboard model, especially when referring to a negative minus a negative. The third way was to generate one or two number sentences as examples to show that their cases worked. Although thermometers were initially used to  develop the idea of the number line with respect to negative numbers, students did not refer to this model when justifying their algorithms. ",36,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities
37,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities,The methods used by the students showed fl exibility in terms of incorporating multiple methods to account for different cases for subtraction. Such fl exibility shows that students’ attempts to develop sensible algorithms at least initially involved approaches that could be considered inelegant or ineffi cient. ,37,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities
38,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities,IMPROVING STUDENTS’ ALGORITHMS IN THE FUTURE,38,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities
39,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities,"The algorithms primarily used language related to the patterns that students observed when subtracting rational numbers (i.e., “Positive minus negative. Change the negative number to its opposite and add”) rather than language that connected actions on the number line to absolute value (i.e., “Positive minus negative. Since the numbers are on opposite sides of zero, you need to fi nd each number’s distance from zero—their absolute values—and add them”). Such connections to absolute value were evident during discussions in both teachers’ classes. In the future, the teachers hope to build on such opportunities to guide students to make the connections more explicit in the algorithms. ",39,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities
40,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities,"The teachers emphasized the importance of beginning with informal activity, which they described as “messing around,” before trying to formalize vocabulary or algorithms.",40,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities
41,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities,THE IMPORTANCE OF INFORMAL ACTIVITY,41,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities
42,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities,"The teachers emphasized the importance of beginning with informal activity, which they described as “messing around,” before trying to formalize vocabulary or algorithms. For example, by solving problems before absolute value was formally defined, students were allowed to consider the relevance of a number’s distance from zero. Introducing procedures like keep-change-change before students can make sense of the operations could lead to more fragile and inflexible knowledge. ",42,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities
43,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities,"OPPORTUNITIES FOR INFORMAL ASSESSMENT Despite the messiness and inefficiency, the teachers believed that the algorithms represented how students thought about the operations, thus providing a more accurate assessment of the students’ understanding than would have been the case if they were simply mimicking memorized procedures. Moreover, as the students created the algorithms, the teachers were able to develop nuanced understandings of their students’ mathematical understanding and their computational fluency. They observed that some students had little difficulty computing with rational numbers but struggled to explain their reasoning, signs of a fragile understanding of the procedures they employed. They also observed that some students were inventive and reasoned well mathematically but were less accurate or efficient. ",43,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities
44,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities,FINAL-DRAFT VERSUS  ROUGH-DRAFT LANGUAGE,44,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities
45,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities,"CCSSM represents final-draft versions of mathematical thought but not the processes by which such thoughts are developed. These thoughts are the language of adult mathematicians and thus emphasize elegance and efficiency. These thoughts are not the  language of young students, who use informal language and inelegant approaches as they make sense of mathematics. The algorithms presented here showed that some of the students recognized the efficiency of simply transforming all subtraction problems to addition, but even some of those students saw fit to consider other ways of subtracting rational numbers. Moreover, other students felt that other methods made more sense to them, even when they required more cases or were more cumbersome to describe. Furthermore, the language used in the algorithms was not always mathematically precise. However, the teachers believed that it was important to allow students to experiment with rough-draft language. ",45,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities
46,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities,STUDENT REASONING  TAKES TIME,46,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities
47,Interpreting Standards as Sense-Making Opportunities,"Asking students to develop their own algorithms was complex, messy, and time-consuming. Furthermore, the final products were less elegant and predictable than what might have occurred if the teachers had introduced the keep-change-change approach before students explored their own approaches. However, the cost of providing students with formal procedures before they have a chance to reason on their own is that it may have constrained opportunities for them to develop flexible—if cumbersome—ways to reason about computation. This situation may have masked their misconceptions and the fragile nature of their knowledge. Teachers and the institutions in  which they work need to make choices about how to interpret CCSSM and how to support one another if they choose an approach that emphasizes exploration and sense making. This choice will require a commitment to allocate time to explore individual topics and engage productively in the mathematical practices listed in CCSSM.
