"Name ______________________________ 3. Most people combine trial and error and knowledge of the English language, including familiar words, to unscramble word puzzles such as this one. Rather than using this method, how long would the list be if you were to write all the possible arrangements of the letters in either the fi rst or the second word of this puzzle? 4. a. What is the dictionary defi nition  of permutation?   b. How many permutations are possible for the letters A, B, C, D, E, F? Explain how to calculate this answer without listing all the possibilities.",1,mtms2012-04-458a,,
"5. The third and fourth words in  this puzzle have 6 letters, but the number of permutations of the letters in each case is 360, not the number you would expect from your answer to question 4b. What is different in the case of these words? Why does that difference change the answer? challenge 6. Billy received a set of 7 action  fi gures for his fi fth birthday, which he lined up on a shelf next to his bed. Every day he rearranges his fi gures. If Billy keeps track of his arrangements to make sure he has a new one every day, how long will it be before he uses all the possible permutations and is forced to repeat? How old will Billy be when that happens? all shooK UP 1. Word scrambles rearrange letters to form a word. Although usually only one answer is correct, it may surprise you to know how many arrangements are incorrect. Try this easy example fi rst: List all the possible arrangements of the letters D, O, R, W, and look for a common word.",2,mtms2012-04-458a,,
"2. Suppose we add 1 more letter,  an S, to the set from question 1. Without listing all the arrangements, can you predict how many there will be? Explain why your answer makes sense.",3,mtms2012-04-458a,,

They should be challenged to find (and explain) a systematic method of generating the arrangements so that they can convince themselves and others that they have found all the possibilities.",18,mtms2012-04-458a,,
"2.  Adding a fifth letter increases the total number of arrangements to 120; 24 × 5 = 120. This answer should make sense because for each of the 24 arrangements given in question 1, the new letter could be inserted in 5 positions. To illustrate, use the word WORD from above:",19,mtms2012-04-458a,,

"W O R S D W O R D S (Students will probably notice that 2 of these 5 arrangements are also English words.)   Note: In this activity, we have not introduced the term factorial or the symbol n! because some middle school students may not have enough background. Depending on the level of your students, you may choose to introduce those representations at this time. In the example above, we can address 5! by writing 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120.",23,mtms2012-04-458a,,
"3.  Both of the first two puzzle words have 5 distinct letters, so the calculation from question 2 applies. For both the first and second jumble, the list would have 5! = 120  arrangements.",24,mtms2012-04-458a,,
"4.  a.  A permutation is an arrangement of the elements in a finite set (in this case, the arrangements of a set of letters).",25,mtms2012-04-458a,,
"  b.  Since we are looking at 6 letters,  we can take the 120 permutations of 5 letters and see that there are 6 positions to insert the sixth letter, or 120 × 6 = 720 permutations.",26,mtms2012-04-458a,,
" Using factorial, there are 6! = 720 permutations of the letters A, B, C, D, E, F. Students should be able to calculate this answer using this reasoning:  Place the 6 letters (in some order) on 6 lines:    __  	 __  	 __  	 __  	 __  	 __   6  ×	 5  ×	 4  ×	 3  ×	 2  ×	 1  There are 6 choices for a letter in the first blank, then 5 remaining choices for a letter in the second blank, 4 remaining choices for the third blank, and so on, until only 1 letter remains for the final position.",27,mtms2012-04-458a,,
"5.  The third and fourth words both  contain 6 letters, so we might expect 720 permutations, as in problem 4. But the difference in this case is that in each word there is a double letter (two Ts in the third word, two Is in the fourth). Because the identical letters are indistinguishable, there are only one-half as many arrangements (360 in each case). For example, the third word (T1 C E T2 I K)  and (T2 C E T1 I K) both produce the arrangement T C E T I K. Interchanging the two Ts did not change the outcome.",28,mtms2012-04-458a,,

"What a terrifi c interdisciplinary activity. I used “All Shook Up” with a group of fi fth-, sixth-, and seventhgrade students of mixed ability who shared an interest in learning how math works. During the previous meeting, we had reviewed basic probability topics and had started discussing what happens when the possible outcomes are not as obvious as the pips on a die. As a teaser for our next session, I asked them to fi gure out the different ways in which the letters S, T, O, P can be arranged. Most of them were able to fi nd all 24 arrangements; some were not.",33,mtms2012-04-458a,,
"When going through the lists  together, they discovered the value of organizing their answers to make sure that nothing was omitted. To reinforce why this was helpful, three volunteers acted out all the ways  that they could arrange themselves standing in a line. When they could not remember what they had already done, they quickly decided to start over. The same person would occupy the fi rst position while the other two changed places, and so on.",34,mtms2012-04-458a,,
"The group then completed the  activity, talking through each question together. There were several chuckles with the fi rst question when they were asked to fi nd a common “word.” They had no diffi culty working through the fi rst fi ve questions, including understanding why 720 was divided by 2 to fi nd the 360 arrangements.",35,mtms2012-04-458a,,
"We extended the activity by fi nd- ing the probability of creating real words from the anagrams for WORD and STOP. For the following session, they were asked to try to unscramble the jumble and to be prepared to discuss the punch line. This was a great ",36,mtms2012-04-458a,,

"I used this cartoon activity with my seventh-grade prealgebra students to further their experience with the counting principle, permutations, and combinations. They worked in small groups and had very little diffi culty with the questions. They then shared their ideas as a whole class. As I circulated, I heard students explaining to one another about the patterns they saw as they made organized lists. Some groups chose to create  tree diagrams to try to show all the possibilities. I think one reason why students were so engaged was because they were working with and rearranging letters. The activity seemed more like a puzzle than “doing math”—at least, that is what one student mentioned to me. Some of my students wanted to extend the activity by looking at the letters in their own names and considering how they could be rearranged. ",44,mtms2012-04-458a,,
