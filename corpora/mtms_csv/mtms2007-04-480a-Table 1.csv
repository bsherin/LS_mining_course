"Tessellations: M. C. Escher 1898–1972” in 1974. I was teaching a class titled recreational Mathematics  at  a  junior  college  in  Montreal  at  the time, and the article served as a basis of the Escherrelated material that I added to the course content. As the years passed, my knowledge of Escher and involvement  with  his  geometric  artwork  grew.  I spoke about Escher art at NCTM conferences; met Escher’s  eldest  son,  George,  at  a  regional  NCTM conference  in  Halifax;  developed  Escher  materials for Dale Seymour publications; and gave a speech titled “Escher in the Classroom” at the International Escher Congress held in rome, Italy, in 1998 (the centennial of Escher’s birth). All of this began for me with a Mathematics Teacher article.",3,mtms2007-04-480a,,
"A  condensed  version  of  the  article  that  I  wrote for the proceedings of the International Escher Congress can be found online at britton.disted.camosun .bc.ca/jbescher.htm. (The article is also accessible from my home page jbmathfun.com.) The sequential  pages  include  animations  of  the  generation  of four of Escher’s tessellating regions, each with distinct generating rules, as well as ideas for Escher- related  classroom  activities  suitable  for  middle school (if not all) students. ",4,mtms2007-04-480a,,
"These ideas include—  •  using simple connect-the-dots exercises to introduce the concept of a polygon, •  generating tessellations with reflectional symmetry using flexible plastic mirrors, •  creating a tessellating cardboard template, •  drawing the corresponding tessellation by hand, •  turning a tessellating template into a rubber stamp, •  printing the corresponding tessellation on dot paper with stamp-pad ink, •  creating a tessellating pop-up sponge jigsaw puzzle, •  exploring tessellations with TesselMania! or Tessellation Exploration computer software, •  creating iron-on tessellating art for a T-shirt, •  building  regular  polyhedra  with  nets  decorated  with Escher-like tessellating creatures, and •  making an Escher kaleidocycle.",5,mtms2007-04-480a,,
"I also maintain three Web pages of pedagogical recreational mathematics links, namely “Number Patterns, fun  with  Curves  and  Topology,”  “Symmetry  and Tessellations,” and “Polyhedra Pastimes” at www.jb mathfun.com.  Many  of  the  links  therein  are  to Escher-related materials. The activities can keep you and your students entertained and challenged. ",6,mtms2007-04-480a,,
