"When students are allowed to use art to show understanding of a mathematics concept, they become excited about mathematics because they have often found more success in art class. “C2 = Creative Coordinates” is the title of a project that combines both art and mathematics. The project lets students illustrate or find an image,  shelley Mchugh,  srmchugh2 @troy.k12 .mi.us, teaches sixth- and seventh-grade prealgebra at Larson Middle School in Troy, MI 48085. She is interested in integrating technology and art into the mathematics curriculum. McHugh also enjoys teaching part-time for Oakland University in Rochester, Michigan.  then plot points to map their design on a grid.",2,mtms2007-09-82a,,
"Artistically inspired students work  harder and are able to convey more meaningful mathematical understandings during the course of this activity. What is astounding is the typically successful mathematics student who feels challenged because he or she is forced  to be creative. However, both types of students can benefit from projects that integrate mathematics with art.  introducing the  coordinate systeM",3,mtms2007-09-82a,,
"After students are introduced to the four quadrants of the coordinate system and the concept of plotting ordered pairs, they will need a lot of practice working with plotting the points. Students enjoy plotting ordered pairs by creating a “connect the dot” type of picture. Plotting Points and Cartesian Cartoons are two books that offer a variety of surprise pictures (Marshall 2000; Mystery Media 1988) (see a sample in fig. 1). It takes about one hour for students to plot the points and create this sort of image. At a glance, teachers can quickly  observe which students can go from the ordered pair to plotting in the correct location on the coordinate plane. The entire class can create the same graph, but students can individualize the image by adding color.  creating a rubric",4,mtms2007-09-82a,,
"Once students master plotting points, they are then asked to apply what they know and create a graph of their own. Students will be required to draw or trace a picture and then turn the image into a list of ordered pairs. A peer will plot the points to test their validity. ",5,mtms2007-09-82a,,
"It is important to have clear goals  for “C2 = Creative Coordinates.” When starting this project with the first group of students, use the teachergenerated rubric to guide expectations for the project (see fig. 2). After the ",6,mtms2007-09-82a,,

"help create the rubric. Give students about five minutes to look over the examples and write on sticky notes what they think should be assessed when they are graded on the project. These suggested expectations should be discussed as a class. Teachers might want to ask students how much credit they think the project should be given. When the class agrees on the project expectations, the rubric should be produced and handed back to students. Students will have a better understanding of expectations because they were able to take some ownership of the class-created rubric. This method of developing a class rubric can apply to just about any project and takes about half a class period to complete.",25,mtms2007-09-82a,,
beginning the Process,26,mtms2007-09-82a,,
"After the rubric has been established, students can begin creating the graph art. Encourage students to either draw an image freehand or find a logo or a character that they would like to trace. These items can often be found online  by typing the subject matter into a search engine. For those students who prefer to trace, it is helpful for them to use the overhead projector as a light box (see fig. 3). The graph paper can be placed on top of the original design and traced rather quickly. It might be necessary to borrow an extra overhead projector that day, since many students will want to trace at the same time. Print two copies of the same blank graph paper for each student. (Using blank grids from the books mentioned will keep the small numbers and grid sizes consistent for all students so that they do not detract from the image.) One copy will be used for the student who is creating the graph and the other copy will be used by a peer who is testing the graph when it is completed. ",27,mtms2007-09-82a,,
"It generally takes about a day for students to decide on a picture and transfer it to graph paper. At this point, it is now time to begin plotting points. We discuss that there should be a minimum and maximum set of ordered pairs that are used. According to my  rubric, I have found that a minimum of 30 and a maximum of 200 ordered pairs works rather well. Of course, the more points used will often give the picture a smoother look, but we also do not want to overwhelm peers when they are asked to test the graph. ",28,mtms2007-09-82a,,
"After the points are plotted, have  students begin writing the directions and ordered pairs. Make sure they keep them in consecutive order and include appropriate stops when needed (see the example in fig. 4). If computers are available, many students may prefer to type the ordered pairs, which gives the project a professional quality and allows students to make corrections easily.  testing the results",29,mtms2007-09-82a,,
"Students are then asked to share their project with a peer who will test the ordered pairs. Most students will take a day to check the ordered pairs for accuracy. Once in a while, a student may be completely off course and have to go back and fix the ordered pairs at this step. Although this can take ",30,mtms2007-09-82a,,

Students enjoy seeing that the picture they have created is now coming to life in their graphing calculators (see fig. 8). “It was fun because  time, encourage students to fix the art, because they will learn more by going back and correcting their work. If computers were used to create the ordered pairs, corrections are fairly easy. The majority of students do a great job with this project (see the student work in fig. 5). Not only do they enjoy it, but they know that they will be accountable for the accuracy of the final product when a fellow student must test and score the quality of the work.  assessing and reviewing",33,mtms2007-09-82a,,
"Before the graphs are turned in for a grade, have students self-assess their own work as well as the graphs they have tested for accuracy. Each tester must review the rubric and score his or her peer. In addition, the creator must look at the completed work and analyze it. This aspect of the project proves to be particularly beneficial and interesting and takes very little time. Specifically, it benefits the creator of the graph because he or she can learn from the reflection process. The results are interesting, because both students usually score the  project with the same amount of points. In the end, many students are proud of their work and are thrilled to save these projects for schoolwide portfolios. These portfolios showcase several items from each class and are used during mock interviews at the end of each student’s middle school experience.",34,mtms2007-09-82a,,

"Once students have created their own graphs, they can begin to use a graphing calculator to reinforce what has just been learned. Students begin by creating a very simple picture that requires only positive coordinates and does not require any stops. In this instance, students are given a list of ordered pairs that will create a heart (see fig. 6). Students are not told what the shape will be and are amazed to see it appear once the ordered pairs are entered into the graphing calculator. As a class, discuss how the ordered pairs can be organized into a table format. Now go to the list feature and enter the values for X in list 1 ",36,mtms2007-09-82a,,

"the shape was a surprise and we didn’t know the calculator could draw like that,” exclaimed Erin, a sixth grader. Ask students to think about what  it would take to move the heart to quadrant II, III, or IV. This is a perfect time to discuss the characteristics of the points that are plotted in each quadrant. Ask students how the list of integers in either L1 or L2 could be changed to move the heart into another quadrant. Students should write down their predictions about what quadrant the shape will move to when L1 or L2 is changed and whether they think the shape will stay the same after it moves. Have students test their prediction by changing just the numbers in L1 (the x-coordinates) to their opposites (negative numbers) to see what happens. Students should make observations and write about their conclusions throughout this extension. Then have the students change the numbers in L1 back to positive integers but change the numbers in L2 (the y-coordinates) to their opposites (negative numbers). Finally, have them change the coor-",60,mtms2007-09-82a,,

Students are motivated to move the picture from one location of the graphing calculator screen to another.

If time permits, reflections, rotations, and translations of the given shape could also be investigated.",62,mtms2007-09-82a,,
"The project usually takes about a  week to complete. When it is finished, students who are usually more interested in art now have more passion for mathematics. Sixth-grader Annika told me, “It made math more fun because it wasn’t just boring paperwork, we got to draw and that is fun!” You will also find that those students who struggle with creativity feel a bit more comfortable taking chances. At the conclusion of the project, Carl exclaimed, “I can’t usually draw, but because of this project, it made me better at art.” “C2 = Creative Coordinates” increases student participation, which is the first step to increasing student achievement.",63,mtms2007-09-82a,,
