5,Technology Helps Students Transcend Part-Whole Concepts,"Osman Balci, and Mido Chang hHow would your students make sense of  the fraction 5/7? Would they interpret it as 5 parts out of 7 equal parts? Could they also understand it as a piece that is 5 times as large as 1/7? The former interpretation aligns with part-whole conceptions, whereas the latter aligns with partitive conceptions. Steffe and Olive (2010) have made such distinctions in students’ fractional knowledge to explain why students experience diffi culties with fractions and to help students overcome those diffi culties. (For summaries of this work, see Norton and McCloskey 2008 and 2009.) ",5,Technology Helps Students Transcend Part-Whole Concepts

7,Technology Helps Students Transcend Part-Whole Concepts,"Part-whole concepts give students an early foundation in understanding  fractions. However, this foundation remains insufficient for mastering fraction concepts that students will see in the K-grade 12 curriculum. In particular, part-whole analyses are meaningless when improper fractions, such as 7/5, are discussed. After all, how can a student make sense of  7 out of 5?",7,Technology Helps Students Transcend Part-Whole Concepts
8,Technology Helps Students Transcend Part-Whole Concepts,"To work with the limitation, students might convert improper fractions to mixed numbers (e.g., 1 and 2/5), but they should also develop understandings that enable them to consider fractions as “numbers in their own right” (Hackenberg 2007, p. 27). Moreover, fraction operations, such as multiplication and division, can be cumbersome or even unintelligible unless students progress beyond part-whole concepts. For this reason, the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSM) calls on teachers to support student development beyond partwhole conceptions, even as early as the third grade (CCSSI 2010). Studies of students’ fractions knowledge indicate that such comprehensions are uncommon, even among middle school  students (Hackenberg 2007; Norton and Wilkins 2010; Olive and  Vomvoridi 2006; Steffe and Olive 2010).",8,Technology Helps Students Transcend Part-Whole Concepts
9,Technology Helps Students Transcend Part-Whole Concepts,"PaRtitioning and iteRating Partitioning and iterating are fundamental mental actions, or operations, that underlie fractions concepts. The limitation of part-whole concepts stems from a reliance on partitioning alone. Partitive thinking, on the other hand, relies on both partitioning and iterating. Of course, it is important that students are able to partition a continuous whole into a specified number of equal parts, as in sharing a candy bar among five friends. However, students should also understand that any one of those parts could be iterated, or multiplied, to produce other fractional parts.

15,Technology Helps Students Transcend Part-Whole Concepts,"Students’ development of partitive conceptions traces a learning trajectory outlined by Steffe and Olive (2010). Students begin by developing partitive understandings for unit fractions, meaning that they can think about unit fractions as sizes relative to a specified whole. For example, students might begin to understand 1/5 as a length that, when iterated (copied or multiplied) five times, reproduces the whole. Later on, students begin to generalize that knowledge and extend it to nonunit proper fractions so that, for instance, they can understand 3/5 as a length that results from three iterations of 1/5. Conceiving of improper fractions as multiples of unit fractions requires further development. ",15,Technology Helps Students Transcend Part-Whole Concepts
16,Technology Helps Students Transcend Part-Whole Concepts,"Figure 1 shows two sample tasks  that we have used in assessing students’ partitive knowledge of unit fractions. The responses are from two seventh-grade students.

21,Technology Helps Students Transcend Part-Whole Concepts,"Each task in figure 1 requires students to iterate a unit fractional part within the given whole to determine its unit-fractional size relative to that whole. The response associated with the task in figure 1a indicates that the student could name the unit fractional part based on the number of iterations within the whole. This is the essence of partitive reasoning, so we can infer that the student had at least begun to develop partitive conceptions for unit fractions. ",21,Technology Helps Students Transcend Part-Whole Concepts
22,Technology Helps Students Transcend Part-Whole Concepts,"The response associated with  the task in figure 1b indicates that the student had not begun that same development with unit fractions. Instead, the response suggests a trial-and-error process of dividing the whole into parts that coincide with those on the smaller piece and then using a part-whole scheme to determine the fraction associated with the smaller piece—the number of parts out of the whole taken up by the smaller piece. In either case, the students’ teachers should consider ways to further support that development.",22,Technology Helps Students Transcend Part-Whole Concepts

24,Technology Helps Students Transcend Part-Whole Concepts,"Fortunately, research tells us how we can support students’ development  of partitive understanding. From his research with a pair of fourth-grade students named Jason and Laura, Steffe (2001) found that he could support their developing knowledge base by engaging them in tasks involving the production of connected multiples from a given unit. For example, the task in figure 2a requires students to iterate, or make connected copies of, the given length to form new lengths.",24,Technology Helps Students Transcend Part-Whole Concepts
25,Technology Helps Students Transcend Part-Whole Concepts,"Steffe concluded that such tasks  create a bridge between students’ use of iterating in discrete, whole-number contexts to their use of iteration in continuous, fractional contexts. Olive and Vomvoridi (2006) achieved similar results with a sixth-grade student named Tim by engaging him in tasks involving the production of a whole from a given unit fractional part. For example, the task in figure 2b requires students to iterate the given 1/7 stick seven times to produce the whole from which it came. ",25,Technology Helps Students Transcend Part-Whole Concepts
26,Technology Helps Students Transcend Part-Whole Concepts,"In general, tasks intended to support conceptual learning should elicit students’ available ways of operating (such as partitioning and iterating) and challenge them to coordinate those mental actions in new ways (Olive 2000). Furthermore, students should have opportunities to assess the success of those new ways of operating and to reflect on them (Simon and Tzur 2004). The educational game we present here was designed with those principles in mind. ",26,Technology Helps Students Transcend Part-Whole Concepts

33,Technology Helps Students Transcend Part-Whole Concepts,"The goal of the game is to satisfy  customer orders for candy bars of specified lengths. Students do this by “slicing” (partitioning) a whole candy bar into some number of pieces and “copying” (iterating) one of those pieces some number of times. At  level 1, partitioning marks in the customer order and the whole bar are visible so that students can rely on their part-whole conceptions of fractions to become familiar with the game.",33,Technology Helps Students Transcend Part-Whole Concepts
34,Technology Helps Students Transcend Part-Whole Concepts,"For example, given the situation  illustrated in figure 4a, a student can see that the customer order (located at the bottom of the screen) is 6 parts out of 8 equal parts in the whole. The actions of slicing the whole into  8 parts and copying one of those parts 6 times can form a bridge in crossing over from a part-whole view to a partitive view. Note that the student could also satisfy the customer order by producing 4 slices and copying one of them 3 times. In terms of game design, this approach aligns with the basic principle of providing easily achievable challenges early on to instill a sense of success, thus leading to engagement, while introducing game mechanics and the operation of the interface (Schell 2008).",34,Technology Helps Students Transcend Part-Whole Concepts

In terms of game play, the right-hand column contains elements that contribute to the narrative and plot of CandyFactory. From top to bottom, the player sees the shift  clock that registers allowable time to complete orders, a customer satisfaction meter that measures speed and accuracy, a bonus meter that figures additional points gained from successfully fulfilling more challenging orders, and a queue of orders at the bottom yet to be filled.",35,Technology Helps Students Transcend Part-Whole Concepts
36,Technology Helps Students Transcend Part-Whole Concepts,"All these features are meant to  enhance challenge in the game  (Vorderer, Hartmann, and Klimmt 2003). In terms of the interface and interaction, CandyFactory presents a color palette and a look and a feel that the target audience found enjoyable. The interface and interaction also leverage touch, swipe, tap, and other gestural movements that prior work has found to be beneficial for investigating mathematical concepts (Evans et al. 2013) ",36,Technology Helps Students Transcend Part-Whole Concepts
37,Technology Helps Students Transcend Part-Whole Concepts,"At level 2, partitioning marks are  no longer visible, but the customer orders are always unit fractions of the whole. Students must determine the number of slices needed so that each slice is the same length as the customer order. Students produce slices by swiping their finger from top to bottom across the bar, an action that Apple software developers refer to as a “finger swipe.” The main idea for students to learn at this level is the inverse (reciprocal) relationship between the number of slices and the size of each slice. For example,  figure 4b illustrates a task in which the customer order is 1/3 of the whole. Students can determine this relationship by iterating the length of the customer order within the whole. Then they can produce the customer order from the whole by dividing (with finger swipes) the whole into three parts. Students begin to learn that when the customer order is smaller, it fits into the whole more times and, thus, more slices are needed. ",37,Technology Helps Students Transcend Part-Whole Concepts

For example, consider the order shown in fi gure 5a. A student might estimate that the order is two iterations of a 1/5 piece and, thus, slice the whole into fi ve pieces (see fi g. 5b) and then drag two copies (see fi g. 5c) to make 2/5. Although measuring reveals that this is not the correct order (see fi g. 5d), the student can go back to adjust slicing and copying and, in the process, begin to understand fractions like 2/5 as sizes relative to the whole. Note that the sequence of actions  outlined above fi ts with research previously described (e.g., Steffe 2001) on how students develop an understanding of the partitive process. Students have to address the size of the given fractional piece relative to the given whole. Whereas at level 2, students can produce the desired piece by imagining how many times it fi ts into (or iterates within) the whole, at level 3, students have to anticipate and coordinate partitioning/iterating actions.",39,Technology Helps Students Transcend Part-Whole Concepts
40,Technology Helps Students Transcend Part-Whole Concepts,"On the “Measure” screen, students can refl ect on the results of their activity (Simon and Tzur 2004); a ruler is provided to aid a more precise comparison between the produced length and the desired length. This allows students to make adjustments in their coordination of partitioning (slicing) and iterating (copying) actions. We do not expect students (or even experts)  to produce the correct fraction on their fi rst try. However, the ways that students adjust their activity are critical to their development of partitive conceptions because they can experience, and begin to anticipate, the size effects of using more or fewer partitions in conjunction with using more or fewer iterations.",40,Technology Helps Students Transcend Part-Whole Concepts

Students in those schools played CandyFactory for about twenty minutes, twice per week, for about ten weeks. Pretests and posttests, as well as observations of game play, were used to evaluate gains. Early results indicate that the app can effectively increase student engagement (Evans et al. 2013) and promote an understanding of this partitive view of fractions (Norton, Wilkins, and Boyce 2012). ",42,Technology Helps Students Transcend Part-Whole Concepts
43,Technology Helps Students Transcend Part-Whole Concepts,"Teachers in the fi ve schools have  used variations of the game to support additional concepts. For example, these teachers have asked students to guess (before slicing or copying) the fractional size of the customer order. Students write down this fraction and then produce it though slicing and copying. Then the students evaluate whether their guess was too large or too small, thus encouraging fraction comparison. If students work with  partners, the partner can then try a second guess, going back and forth with a string of ordered fractions until the customer order is satisfi ed. Teachers can also challenge students to produce the customer order in multiple ways, supporting their conceptions of equivalent fractions.
