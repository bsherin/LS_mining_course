"Constructingspatial h Many students have a difficult time  making a connection between the net and its three-dimensional counterpart. Burris (2005) suggests, “Prior to being formally introduced to the idea of a net, children can use their visual skills and logical reasoning to determine whether a figure was produced by folding or curling a page of paper” (p. 264). This suggestion may work for simple figures, but it becomes more challenging when dealing with complex figures. However, the process can be feasible if students can use geometry software. To work with my students, I se- struct a net for one of the two congruent solid pieces of both a triangular pyramid and a cube. (Students can also complete these activities using a compass and straightedge.) lected a triangular pyramid and a cube because they provide a complex rich context that will be able to help their students improve their spatial sense. The solids were sectioned intentionally into two congruent shapes, and students were asked to construct their nets. I described a net and demonstrated how to construct one using The Geometer’s Sketchpad. To design, construct, explore, and manipulate a two-dimensional figure, I guided my students through several net-designing activities. They were asked to con-",0,mtms2010-04-472a,,
"How can a piece of paper be folded and cut to form a cube? Remember the first time you tried to find the shape (the net) that creates a cube or were asked which arrangements of six adjacent squares could be folded to make a cube? Such spatial visualization is not intuitive. Through my experience teaching preservice middle school teachers, I realized the need to strengthen skills connecting the net  (a two-dimensional figure that can be folded into a specific three-dimensional shape) to the solid or looking at the solid and visualizing a net and being able to create it. ",1,mtms2010-04-472a,,
"The curriculum should give  students opportunities to “visualize and represent geometric figures with special attention to developing spatial sense” (NCTM 1989, p. 112). Linn and Petersen (1985) define spatial sense as “the mental process used to perceive, store, recall, create, edit, and communicate spatial images” (p. 1479). Spatial sense is useful to students when using two-dimensional diagrams that represent three-dimensional solids (Izard 1990).  actiVitY With a  triangular pYraMid I started with two congruent three- dimensional pieces of a regular tetrahedron (see fig. 1) constructed in Sketchpad and gave them to students to think about how to build the net. Students developed two interesting approaches to the problem by starting with (1) a square and (2) the net of a tetrahedron. ",2,mtms2010-04-472a,,
Method 1: Start with a Square,3,mtms2010-04-472a,,
"Students looked at one of the congruent solid pieces and realized that one face was a square. One student suggested starting with this square to construct the net, because then the remaining faces could go around it. One student guided the class on the construction using Sketchpad and starting with a square. (See the stages of construction in fig. 2.) He gave these instructions: ",4,mtms2010-04-472a,,

"By constructing segments through points B, E, L, F, and C as shown, the students constructed the trapezoid (see fig. 2c). They then constructed another equilateral triangle on side CD and another trapezoid on side AD. They then hid the circles used for construction, which uncovered the net (see fig. 2d). ",8,mtms2010-04-472a,,
"The students printed the complete  net on two colors of heavy paper and cut and folded them to form the tetrahedrons, which could be combined to form the triangular pyramid shown in figure 1. Folding and taping the solids helped the students visualize the entire process of making the net and see how they can move from a two-dimensional figure to a threedimensional solid. Sketchpad allowed students to correct any construction  errors and size the sketches much more easily than they could if they had been using a compass and straightedge.",9,mtms2010-04-472a,,
Method 2: Start with the Net of a Tetrahedron,10,mtms2010-04-472a,,
"The next challenge was to determine the net of one piece of the tetrahedron if we started with the net of the whole tetrahedron. Although the students were unsure what to do, they referred to the solid pieces for ideas. One student noted that there were four equilateral triangular faces of the tetrahedron and suggested the following construction, whose stages are shown in figure 3:  1.  Construct segment AB and use  point A as the center of a circle with radius AB to construct circle C1.  2.  Use point B as the center of a circle  with radius AB to construct circle C2, which intersects C1 at point C. 3.  Use points A, B, and C to construct  triangle ABC.  4.  Using circles C1 and C2, which also meet at point D, construct triangle ADB. ",11,mtms2010-04-472a,,

"At this point, the student was  unsure of the next step and asked the class to help with the construction. These steps were suggested:  5.  Construct an equilateral triangle  on side AB.  6.  Construct circle C1, center A, and circle C2, center B, to meet at point J to construct equilateral triangle ABJ (see fig. 2b). ",14,mtms2010-04-472a,,
"Constructing a trapezoid was challenging to most of the students, but they made the following observations and suggestions: •  Three equilateral triangles form  the trapezoid; we can construct the equilateral triangle using side BC by constructing circle C3, center C, that meets circle C2, point L.  •  Construct another circle C4 of the same radius as circles C1 and C2, center L, to intersect circle C2 at point E and circle C3 at point F.",15,mtms2010-04-472a,,

"Another student pointed out that it might be much easier to construct the net of a tetrahedron by first constructing triangle FDE and finding the midpoints of its sides (A, B, and C) and then using those points to construct triangle ABC. Some students had difficulty visualizing if that triangle was the net of a tetrahedron until a student cut it out and folded it to make a tetrahedron. ",19,mtms2010-04-472a,,
"I then asked the students, “How do you use the figure to construct a net of one piece of a tetrahedron?” [referring to fig. 3b]. The students tried to figure this out and got ideas from the tetrahedrons but made little progress. One student observed that “it looks like to get the two pieces, the faces are sliced through the midpoints of adjacent sides of the face.”",20,mtms2010-04-472a,,
"The student’s suggestion generated an interesting discussion, and some members of the class thought it would not work.

"Figure 3d shows four faces of the five faces (the square face is missing) of one of the pieces of the tetrahedron. Some students were still having trouble visualizing how this shape was going to form one piece of the tetrahedron. Another student pointed out that the only distinction between this net and the net in figure 2 “is that this one will have the square face open because the square face is not part of the net of the tetrahedron” (see fig. 3c). There were interesting discussions among students as they raised questions and tried to imagine how the solid would look after the net was folded.  actiVitY With a cube The two solid pieces of a cube with hexagonal sides is the more challenging net to visualize (see fig. 4). I gave the two regular hexagonal pieces of a cube to my students and asked them to find how their nets were constructed. They suggested three methods, two of which were similar in some aspects. The three ways suggested were to start with (1) a square, (2) a hexagon, and (3) the net of a cube. ",24,mtms2010-04-472a,,
Method 1: Start with a Square,25,mtms2010-04-472a,,
"I allowed the students to discuss the problem among themselves and struggle with the construction of  figure 5. They used two congruent solids for ideas and employed Sketchpad to construct square ABCD (see fig. 6a). They selected segments CB and AB and constructed their midpoints. Initially, some students were unsure why they were using  midpoints, but completing the piece helped them visualize the idea. The student continued with the construction, giving the following instructions to one another, using the labels identified in figures 5 and 6: 1.  Use midpoints E and F; construct segment FE and then construct a hexagon using EF as its side and rotate it with center F and a 120 degree angle of rotation.  2.  Use created segment FH and  rotate it with center H and a 120 degree angle of rotation; continue the process to construct hexagon EFHLMN (see fig. 6a).",26,mtms2010-04-472a,,

"Students revisited the completed solid for ideas on how to proceed. They realized that they needed to construct an isosceles triangle but were unsure where. Some suggested that it could be either on side FH or CF. Depending on which side they chose, the constructions were similar but resulted in slightly different figures. They decided to construct the triangle with FH as one side. As they continued with the construction, one student gave the following directions:  3.  Construct circles C1 and C2 with both radii FC (half length of CB), meeting at point G.",28,mtms2010-04-472a,,
4.  Construct segment GF and GH to  get triangle FGH (see fig. 6b).,29,mtms2010-04-472a,,
"I then asked the students what to do next. Most of them investigated point D in square ADCB and noted that it was equidistant from points F and E (FD = ED). With my help, they applied this idea of equidistance from points H and L to determine point J. Eventually, they devised the following steps in the construction:  5.  Using points H and L as the  centers and radius FD, construct circles C4 and C5 both meeting at point J (see fig. 6c).  6.  By using point L as center and  radius FC, construct circle C3.  7.  To construct the two legs of the  square, construct a circle C6 from J, center J and radius CB, which intersects circles C2 and C3 at points K and I, respectively. ",30,mtms2010-04-472a,,
"I then asked them to repeat this process for the rest of the other segments of the hexagon to find the net (see fig. 6d) and then hide segments FB and EB and point B. At this point, some students were not convinced that the net would make the two pieces of the cube. They were convinced after they cut it out and folded the net. The class was impressed and eager to learn more. ",31,mtms2010-04-472a,,
"One student decided to place one  side of the isosceles triangle on CF instead on FH (see fig. 7). Using this method, interesting differences were noted. The student remarked that since the two legs of the isosceles triangle would have measure CF and the third leg FH, it could be constructed as follows: •  Using point C as the center and CF as the radius, construct circle C1.  •  Using F as the center and FH  as the radius, construct circle C2 meeting circle C1 at G to form triangle CFG (see fig. 7a).
