"With some courts or fields, you  might decide that a comparison based totally on your experience is sufficient to answer the question. In other cases, you might need to know the dimensions of the fields or courts before you can determine an answer. Which questions can be answered with an estimate (MP-5), and which need more precise calculations (MP-6)?  addRessing the Role  oF estiMation",3,mtms2013-05-566a,,
"Estimation is an important mathematical process that is addressed in CCSSM, and it takes different forms. Computational estimation is a useful form of estimation because it involves working with real-world data (often in the form of messy numbers) and turning them into numbers that are easier to use (MP-6) to produce a reasonable result (or estimate). For example, the standard dimensions of a doubles  tennis court are 78 ft. × 36 ft. If you wanted to estimate the area of a doubles court, you might round up to  80 ft. × 40 ft. and estimate the area as 3200 ft.2 (see fig. 2). Since both dimensions were rounded up, the actual ",4,mtms2013-05-566a,,
"Providing problems that interest and engage students in doing mathematics is a constant challenge, but it is a goal that good teachers consistently try to maintain. Connecting the problems to key mathematical concepts and skills is also essential. As educators ourselves, it is also important to ensure that the mathematical practices highlighted in the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSM) are reflected in our instruction (see fig. 1). This article focuses on math problems related to the size of sports fields and courts. In the process, we use some important estimation techniques and strategies that facilitate problem solving. We have also highlighted mathematical practices (MP) that seem to naturally surface in this problem setting. ",5,mtms2013-05-566a,,
"Is a volleyball court larger  than a basketball court? Is a soccer field larger than a football field? Which is larger, a pool table or a Ping-Pong® table?

In fact, this estimate may be more useful than the exact area of  2808 ft.2. For example, if the court were being resurfaced, an overestimate of the amount of surface coating needed would be better than an underestimate. This context provides an example of using appropriate tools strategically and attending to the appropriate level of precision.",7,mtms2013-05-566a,,
"Measurement estimation is another powerful and practical form of estimation. A benchmark, a useful measuring tool, falls within this category. For example, if you are 5 feet tall, then your height can serve as a personal benchmark. If you see someone taller than you, then you know that he or she is over 5 feet tall. If you see someone who is about your height, you can make a good estimate based on your own height (MP-2).",8,mtms2013-05-566a,,
"Chunking, another tool that falls under measurement estimation, uses benchmarks in an iterative process. For example, if you know that a theater has 20 seats in each row and that the theater contains about 30 rows, you might use the number of seats in a row as a chunk, multiply 20 by 30, and estimate that there are about 600 seats in the theater (MP-7 and 8). Similarly, if you know that the length of one slab or section of a sidewalk is about 4 feet, then you could estimate the length of the sidewalk in front of a building by multiplying the number of slabs by 4 feet. If one segment of a flagpole is about 6 feet and it has four segments, then a reasonable estimate for the height of the flagpole is about 24 feet. Looking for structure and regularity is a hallmark of good mathematical thinking.",9,mtms2013-05-566a,,

"Table 1 shows dimensions of some common playing surfaces. These dimensions provide all the data necessary to compare the various courts and fields used in many sports. However, seeing a visual representation of these sports surfaces on a common scale is helpful and facilitates the notion of chunking when estimating. ",22,mtms2013-05-566a,,
"For example, figure 3 shows a diagram of a volleyball court, a basketball court, and a football field overlaid on a soccer field. Viewing all these courts and fields superimposed on one another challenges us to make sense of this figure, but once we understand  the visual model, it helps us understand the problem (MP-1 and MP-4). All these images use the same scale (MP-6), facilitating direct comparisons and uses of chunking and regularity to make estimates about their relative size (MP-5, 7, 8). It is easy to see that a soccer field and football field have the same length (from goal line to goal line), but the soccer field is a bit wider. Likewise, one can use chunking and conclude that the length from one end of a basketball court to the other is less than onethird the length of a football field. ",23,mtms2013-05-566a,,

"Note: Some dimensions, such as those of a basketball court, may vary. For example, high school and college basketball courts are usually either 80 feet long or 94 feet long. other surfaces, such as a tennis court, are standard size. The size of a football field depends on whether you are measuring goal line to goal line (100 yards) or goalpost to goalpost (120 yards). it also depends on whether you are measuring a U.S. football field or a Canadian league field.

"be placed on a football field? Figure 4 illustrates some ways in which basket- ball courts could be arranged on a football field. These tessellations are examples of chunking using the basketball court as the unit, or chunk. Some unused area on the football field leaves open the question as to whether there are other ways to place the basketball  courts on the football field so that more of the field is covered. This makes the original problem more interesting because it provides opportunities to explore different ways to tessellate the basketball courts on the football field (MP-3). In each case, one needs to consider how much area of the football field is left uncovered (MP-5).",37,mtms2013-05-566a,,
"Figure 5 shows how two students decided how many basketball courts would fit on a football field. Whitney used chunking to place basketball courts on the football field and decided that 8 or 9 courts could fit. Marty computed the areas and concluded that there should be room for as many as 11 basketball courts on the football field. Whitney showed that as many as 9 courts could be placed on a football field; from Marty, we know that the maximum number is 11. Now the challenge is to tessellate more than 9 courts or present an argument that more than 9 is impossible (MP-3). How would the problem change if the football field were extended to include the end zones? ",38,mtms2013-05-566a,,
"Figure 6 shows how a tennis court, a shuffleboard court, and a Ping-Pong table compare using the same scale. Although it is easy to see that several shuffleboard courts will fit on a tennis court, it is also easy to see that there would be much unused space. We might ask, “If shuffleboard courts were placed on a tennis court, how much of the tennis court would not be used?” In addition to estimating areas and tessellating the figures, we could also explore perimeters of fields and courts. Ratios and percentages could be used to explore and describe the comparisons (MP-5). For example:  •	 What	is	the	ratio	of	the	area	of	 a Ping-Pong table to a volleyball court? •	 Could	a	basketball	court	fit	on	the	 surface of an Olympic swimming pool? •	 If	a	volleyball	court	were	placed	on	 a tennis court, about what percentage of the area of the tennis court would be covered? What percentage would be uncovered?",39,mtms2013-05-566a,,

How do their areas compare? •	 If	a	bowling	alley	were	laid	on	 a basketball court, about what percentage of the basketball court would be covered? What percentage would be uncovered? •	 What	percentage	of	a	Canadian	 football field is a U.S. football field?",40,mtms2013-05-566a,,
"Students can use the Internet or other resources to find court dimensions, and they will likely find some other playing fields of interest. We have used rectangular fields,  but baseball stadiums introduce some additional challenges in making comparisons of size. What is the shape of the typical baseball field? Are all baseball fields the same size? How and why do the dimensions of a baseball field differ? How are they alike?",41,mtms2013-05-566a,,
"Using visual clues to estimate is a powerful and often-used skill. Visual clues also provide some real-world applications, such as connecting mathematics to geography. For example, reading maps and using some known distances to estimate other distances is a useful strategy. The map of the United States provides a rich opportunity for chunking estimation (see fig. 7). Colorado is a good state to use as a benchmark, or chunking unit, because it is nearly rectangular. Its total land area is 103,730 square miles or about 100,000 mi.2. Using Colorado as a benchmark, students can identify some states that have more than 100,000 square miles of land area. Students might trace the outline of the state of Colorado on a piece of paper, cut out the region, and use it as a benchmark or chunk to compare with other states and list some states that have less than 100,000 square miles of area.
