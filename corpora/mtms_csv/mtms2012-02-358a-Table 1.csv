The Common Core State Standards Initiative (CCSSI 2010) and Curriculum Focal Points for Prekindergarten through Grade 8 Mathematics: A Quest for Coherence (NCTM 2006) have both suggested a move toward a more focused and coherent curriculum targeting fewer topics. Within those designated topics, students should be engaged in relevant mathematics, set in real-life contexts, which make connections among mathematical ideas and to other subjects. For example, the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics suggests that for students to  d Financial literacy involves much ",6,mtms2012-02-358a,,
"Do students get into fi nancial trouble? Yes. In fact, in 2005, about 150,000 young adults between eighteen and twenty-four declared bankruptcy (Godfrey 2006). According to research, few middle school students can answer basic fi nancial literacy questions related to money management, savings, and spending (Godfrey 2006; Tennyson and Nguyen 2001; Valentine and Khayum 2005). Therefore, it is essential to teach students about fi nancial literacy in middle school.

"In our middle school, as done elsewhere, we have set aside additional time to help students who are academically behind in mathematics. Rather than remediate, we wanted to enrich the learning opportunities for these students and concluded that topics related to fi nancial planning were appropriate for this purpose. We developed lessons around various fi nancial themes (budgeting, savings, and spending) while focusing on the mathematical needs of our students (number sense, operations, and linear and exponential growth). These lessons illustrate two ways of infusing fi nancial literacy as a context in mathematics. They are not intended to be used in sequence (as you will see by the varying levels of mathematics content).  and integers are particularly important when working with fi nancial spreadsheets, monthly budgets, bank statements, and amortization tables.
