7,Decimal Fractions: An Important Point,"How can a simple dot—the decimal point—be the source of such frustration for students and teachers? As I worked through my own frustrations, I found that my students seemed to fall into groups in terms of misconceptions that they revealed when talking about and working with decimals. When asking students to illustrate their thinking and explain their ideas using various models, it became apparent that they lacked an understanding of place value in our base-ten number system. Furthermore, they did not recognize that decimal fractions ",7,Decimal Fractions: An Important Point

9,Decimal Fractions: An Important Point,"Knowledge of rational number is built on a foundation of prerequisite knowledge. Decimal representation is compounded in complexity by the merging of whole-number knowledge and common fractions, with very speciﬁ c kinds of units. As students incorporate new concepts of rational number into their existing knowledge, we often see systematic and predictable errors. The conceptual understanding that students possess results in speciﬁ c misconceptions. Such misconceptions are inherent to learning and unavoidable. The errors that are made provide important diagnostic information for teachers. This article will focus on research on decimal comparison strategies, the behavior we see from students, and what it reveals about the thinking patterns and misconceptions that students possess as their knowledge develops over time.",9,Decimal Fractions: An Important Point
10,Decimal Fractions: An Important Point,BACKGROUND,10,Decimal Fractions: An Important Point
11,Decimal Fractions: An Important Point,"I witnessed students struggling with decimals throughout middle school and beyond. Sometimes it occurred because students failed to connect existing knowledge to new knowledge. Often, they saw instruction on decimal fractions as no different than whole-number knowledge. As a teacher, I created this environment. When comparing the numbers to the right of the decimal point, I would encourage students to annex zeros and then compare the numbers as if they were whole numbers. Trying to simplify the process for my students prevented them from creating meaning and masked their true understanding (D’Ambrosio and Kastberg 2012). Instruction on decimals as an extension of the whole-number system often occurs with inadequate understanding of place-value concepts (Fuson 1990). As a result, various issues begin to percolate. For example, students write too  many digits in a column or they believe that there is symmetry about the decimal point resulting in a “oneths” place to mirror a units digit. As with whole numbers, some students also think that a decimal fraction with more digits after the decimal point, the larger the value of the digits (e.g., 0.271 is viewed as being larger than 0.81).",11,Decimal Fractions: An Important Point
12,Decimal Fractions: An Important Point,"Research reveals several potential reasons for the lack of understanding of decimal fractions. Students’ prior knowledge may be predominately procedural, which may account for misconceptions applied to decimal numbers (Hiebert and Wearne 1985). Often, students inappropriately apply rules, resulting in the right answer for the wrong reason, reinforcing an inappropriate use of the rule. The basis for this thinking then persists, and procedural ﬂ aws are not corrected (Hiebert and Wearne 1985; Steinle and Stacey 2004b). Rule-based instruction produces accurate answers initially, but  students who are instructed using only procedural methods tend to regress in performance over time (Woodward, Howard, and Battle 1997; Steinle and Stacey 2004a). ",12,Decimal Fractions: An Important Point
13,Decimal Fractions: An Important Point,"Mack (1995) indicates that with time and direct effort, students can separate whole-number from rationalnumber constructs and develop a meaningful understanding of how fractions and decimals are represented symbolically. What does this effort look like? First, it requires a teacher to be armed with knowledge of how students think about decimals. Second, it requires that a teacher be equipped with tools to help reveal student misconceptions and then build on student thinking in a meaningful way.",13,Decimal Fractions: An Important Point

36,Decimal Fractions: An Important Point,STUDENT MISCONCEPTIONS REVEALED,36,Decimal Fractions: An Important Point
37,Decimal Fractions: An Important Point,"To get a sense of how middle school students think about decimals and to identify their misconceptions, I gave a decimal comparison test designed by Stacey, Steinle, and Chambers (1999) to over 350 students in grades 6−8 from two different schools. The results were consistent with previous research, and the students fell into predictable classiﬁ cations when comparing pairs of decimals (Moloney and Stacey 1997; Nesher and Peled 1986; Resnick et al. 1989; Sackur-Grisvard  and Leonard 1985; Steinle and Stacey 2004a). I then asked the students to represent or explain decimal numbers to me to get a better sense of the type of conceptual understanding they possessed. I used an instrument designed by Martinie and Bay-Williams (2003) (see ﬁ g. 1) and asked them to represent 0.6 and 0.06 in these four ways:  1.  Illustrate where these two numbers  would fall on a number line 2.  Shade 10 × 10 grids to represent  each number 3.  Use money to represent the two  values  4.

57,Decimal Fractions: An Important Point,"The results indicate that students’ success with the decimal tasks varied from representation to representation, and their work often provided evidence to support their classiﬁ cation from the decimal comparison test. Perhaps the most notable result was the lack of success demonstrated by the task experts. Many of these students could accurately show 0.6 and 0.06 in one  or two representations, but not all four, and some struggled to model using any representation. Important ideas about how students think about decimal fractions emerged from their work with all four representations, but they struggled the most with the use of a number line and the idea of using place value (see table 2).",57,Decimal Fractions: An Important Point

The representational meaning for decimal fractions written symbolically depends on an understanding of the base-ten number system and place value. An understanding of what this symbolizes in terms of size or value depends on the existence of number sense and, in particular, fraction sense developed through area models and number lines.

However, this is also an example of “column overﬂ ow,” a perception that 0.6 = 6 tenths; 0.15 = 15 tenths; and, therefore, that 0.15 > 0.6.

75,Decimal Fractions: An Important Point,WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR TEACHERS? Being able to identify student understanding in a lab setting or using retrospective analysis is different from being able to recognize student understanding in a classroom setting in which speed of recognition is critical (Steffe and Thompson 2000). Relating misconceptions to representations helps reduce lag time and informs teaching decisions. Questioning strategies and teacher reﬂ ection are the keys to using the four representations tasks as well as other decimal tasks to transform student thinking about decimals.,75,Decimal Fractions: An Important Point
76,Decimal Fractions: An Important Point,making they possess. This prompting may actually cause some students to rethink their notion of decimals as they explain the reasoning behind their answers. Other students will persist with their line of thinking and demonstrate a misconception that is more resistant. ,76,Decimal Fractions: An Important Point
77,Decimal Fractions: An Important Point,"Armed with the knowledge of the misconceptions that students bring with them and the reasons for them, the teacher can consider asking questions that can guide students to change their thinking.

However, very few could demonstrate an understanding using all four representations, including those students who would be classiﬁ ed “experts” at using decimal comparison items. This knowledge points to issues that we can use in instruction: ",79,Decimal Fractions: An Important Point
80,Decimal Fractions: An Important Point,A good problem is often a broad task with a clear purpose that allows a teacher to formatively assess student understanding and differentiate instruction based on what the task reveals. Understanding the misconceptions that students bring with them and what they look like enables the teacher to plan for them. A teacher can contemplate the following two levels of questions as decimal tasks are being planned and implemented.,80,Decimal Fractions: An Important Point
81,Decimal Fractions: An Important Point,1.  What questions can I ask to ﬁ nd  out what students are thinking and to elicit their reasoning? 2.  What leading questions can I ask to guide students to change their thinking? ,81,Decimal Fractions: An Important Point
82,Decimal Fractions: An Important Point,"As a decimal task is implemented in the classroom, it is imperative that the teacher press students to explain their reasoning. In doing so, he or she is asking students to make explicit the sense  1.  Students with particular misconceptions prefer certain representations. When asked to compare pairs of decimals, they will reveal a misconception (longer-is-larger or shorter-is-larger behaviors). They will exhibit this behavior using one or more representations but often accurately depict decimal numbers using a different representation.  2.  Although experts accurately identi- ﬁ ed the larger decimal from a pair of decimal numbers, they used the representations in a way that indicated that they held a misconception.",82,Decimal Fractions: An Important Point
83,Decimal Fractions: An Important Point,"3.  By knowing what representations a student with a particular misconception is more comfortable with and why, we can (from a teaching perspective) leverage uncomfortable representations as didactic objects to change the student’s misconception (Thompson 2002). In other words, we ask students to work with an uncomfortable representation and then discuss their actions with that representation. We can highlight the actions and results that are incompatible with their previous understanding and leverage that reﬂ ection on new representation and new actions to push for a different target understanding.",83,Decimal Fractions: An Important Point
84,Decimal Fractions: An Important Point,"The remedy for all misconceptions is not the same. However, for the purpose of this article, general recommendations can be made once teachers view the work that students do through the lens of the misconceptions discussed in this article. These recommendations are based on the assertion that the symbolic notation of decimals is to be viewed as a notation for a particular type of fraction (speciﬁ cally with base-ten denominators). ",84,Decimal Fractions: An Important Point
85,Decimal Fractions: An Important Point,"Many students in my study lacked either the understanding that decimals are special fractions with base-ten denominators, a fundamental understanding of the base-ten number system, or both. It is unlikely that students will gain proﬁ ciency with decimals if they misunderstand the fraction-decimal connection and do not see decimals as being an extension of the base-ten system. Mistakes reveal student misconceptions or overgeneralizations and provide an opportunity to learn, both for the teacher and for the student (Shaughnessy 2011). ",85,Decimal Fractions: An Important Point
86,Decimal Fractions: An Important Point,"WHAT CAN CLASSROOM TEACHERS DO? 1. Incorporate multiple representations in developing decimal concepts. This  will deepen and broaden students’ understanding. By identifying representations with which students are both most and least comfortable, the four representations can be used for formative assessment. Deliberately selecting and structuring lessons around the least-comfortable representations allows the four representations to be used for instructional purposes, as well. Generating class discussions around common misunderstandings uncovered in tasks is a powerful tool (Shaughnessy 2011); building that task around a particular representation is a powerful way of targeting which misunderstandings are uncovered and discussed (Thompson 2002).",86,Decimal Fractions: An Important Point
87,Decimal Fractions: An Important Point,"2. Provide explicit instruction and  supporting visuals to help students understand the base-ten number system and how it is expanded to include decimal fractions. Students need to work on place value and special fractions with dominators of 10, 100, and 1000. They can use the part-whole representation of fractions, speciﬁ cally base-ten blocks or linear arithmetic blocks (see http://extranet.edfac.unimelb.edu.au/",87,Decimal Fractions: An Important Point
88,Decimal Fractions: An Important Point,"DSME/decimals/SLIMversion/ teaching/models/lab.shtml), to help them explore the columns to the right of the decimal point. As students “build” numbers, they must symbolically highlight on a place-value chart the place value of the digits. When comparing two decimal numbers, students with misconceptions can be asked to illustrate them with the base blocks, compare the numbers, and explain their reasoning.  3.Use language that highlights the  nature of the values. For example, explicitly using the term “special fractions” when talking about denominators of 10, 100, or 1000 will draw attention to the fact these base-ten numbers can be easily translated from fraction to decimal. Use terms, such as “friendly fractions,” to refer to those that can be converted fairly easily to a ",88,Decimal Fractions: An Important Point

Incorporate money in a way that highlights the fractional aspects of the decimal notation. The fundamental fact about equivalent fractions immediately tells us that a fraction with denominator 10, such as 6/10, can be considered a fraction with a denominator 100, in this case 60/100. In the classroom, this can be supported by the conversation that 6 dimes equals 60 cents and 6 dimes combined with 12 cents makes 72 cents. Modeling and talking about fraction and decimal fraction relationships will enable students to compare decimals using the meaning of a decimal as a fraction.  5. Use the area model to help students make sense of number lines. Given that students begin to work with fractions using the part-whole area model, this makes sense. Transform fraction strips into a number line, draw the number line the length of a set of fraction strips, and then use the strips to mark and label tick marks on the line.
