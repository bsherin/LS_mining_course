16,Every Graph Tells a Story,"edu, Grand Valley State University, Allendale, Michigan.  tThe Every Graph Tells a Story  problem generated a wide variety of creative and mathematically appropriate responses from 19 sixth-grade to eighth-grade students from Potomac, Maryland; Melbourne, Florida; and Cincinnati, Ohio. Robyn Wise, a prealgebra teacher at the McLean School in Potomac, Maryland, had recently explored slopes and rates of change with her students using motion sensors and magnetic cars. This problem served as a good follow-up to that work for her students. Tracy Grosick, a sixth-grade to eighth-grade teacher of accelerated mathematics at St.  Bernard School Taylor Creek in Cincinnati, Ohio, also used this problem as a follow-up to writing short scenarios to describe graphs that her students had done earlier in the year. In this problem, students are given a piecewise graph with the horizontal axis labeled “time” and the vertical axis left blank. Students were encouraged to be creative in their choice of a vertical axis label and then to write a story that fit the graph based on their choice of label. Students rose to the challenge and chose interesting and wide-ranging vertical axis labels, including the following: •  Height (in feet) •  Wage ($/hour) •  Number of items found at  a scavenger hunt per minute •  Speed (mph) •  Mood (depressed to   very, very happy) •  Weight (pounds) •  Amount of suspense (no   units given) •  Levels of dance ability •  Distance (miles) •  Number of calories eaten/burned •  Number of pages read ",16,Every Graph Tells a Story
17,Every Graph Tells a Story,"It is a complex task to pay attention both to how the dependent variable is changing with respect to the independent variable (how the graph increases, decreases, or remains constant) and to the meaning of the axes and the units on the axes while also writing a coherent story. A common misconception with interpreting graphs in a context is to treat the graph like a picture (this is called an iconic interpretation of a graph). Students using an iconic interpretation might say that the graph represents a student going up a hill and then back down because that is the general shape of the graph. None of the students’ submitted work showed signs of an iconic interpretation of the graph. A few students wrote creative stories but failed to completely explain how the stories mapped to the given graph. For example, a few students focused solely on time and did not refer explicitly to how the dependent variable was changing over that time. Another student focused mainly on the dependent variable without providing detail about how long it took for each event in the story to occur.",17,Every Graph Tells a Story
18,Every Graph Tells a Story,One aspect of the graph that students were particularly strong at interpreting was the horizontal (constant) section from a time of 5 to 6.5 units. ,18,Every Graph Tells a Story
19,Every Graph Tells a Story,"For example, Teresa, a seventh-grade student in Tracy Grosick’s class, used weight (in pounds) as her dependent variable and interpreted the horizontal portion of the graph to be the period when the character in her story neither gained nor lost any weight. Similarly, Felicity, another of Grosick’s seventh graders, used level in a dance company as her dependent variable and interpreted the horizontal portion of the graph to be the time when the character in her story hit the peak of her dancing career and was offered a contract to join a company. However, after only 1.5 years, the dancer lost her job, and her dance level began to decline. Felicity did a particularly good job in this portion of her story by giving specific information about the value of the dependent variable (level 3.5 of dance) and the time frame in which that value occurred (1.5 years).",19,Every Graph Tells a Story
20,Every Graph Tells a Story,"Many students also succeeded in incorporating into their stories the time frames where the graph was increasing and decreasing but were often less successful at differentiating between when the graph was changing at a constant rate (linear portions of the graph) and when the graph was changing at a changing rate (non-linear portions of the graph). One student who succeeded in this, however, was Kiran, a sixth-grade student in Catherine Koos’s class. Kiran wrote a delightful story about Bob’s drive to work and used speed (mph) as his dependent variable. To make the numbers plausible, Kiran ",20,Every Graph Tells a Story

22,Every Graph Tells a Story,"Bob Schäfer was your average man who loved his job. He lived in Orlando, and liked it because it’s not too quiet, but not too loud. Every morning, Bob Schäfer drove to work. He worked at Del Frisco’s and he loved it there; the diners were friendly, the food was fantastic, and the wage was great, what was there not to love? Del Frisco’s was also fairly close to his house, taking around 10 minutes to reach there on a normal Orlando morning.",22,Every Graph Tells a Story
23,Every Graph Tells a Story,"Bob Schäfer only loved one thing more than his job, math. Well, actually graphs was what he found amazing. He’s graphed all kinds of wonders; linear, quadratic, power, polynomial, rational, exponential, logarithmic, and sinusoidal equations. He thought he’d graphed almost everything he could possibly graph, until one morning, it hit him like a train. He didn’t graph his journey to his favorite place, Del Frisco’s!",23,Every Graph Tells a Story
24,Every Graph Tells a Story,"That morning, after he got ready for work, he drove his car to work, but this time, wrote down numbers every minute, after he left his parking lot. One thing to know about Bob is that he was very cautious but a very good multi-tasker. Bob was driving at 10 mph when he left the parking lot and by minute 3, he hit 35 mph. Bob noticed that he drove those ﬁ rst three minutes at a steady rate, gaining the same amount of speed each minute.",24,Every Graph Tells a Story
25,Every Graph Tells a Story,"Now here stood the biggest bridge in all of Orlando, the bridge that takes up the most time of Bob’s journey. For two minutes, Bob drove up the bridge, starting from rock bottom. He still had kept the speed of 35 mph, however, but the ﬁ rst minute driving upwards, Bob noticed that he’d hardly gained any speed; about 4 mph. The second minute on the bridge was a bit different. He gradually gained more and more speed until he hit 45 mph. Bob was now on top of the bridge, yet this sentence is at the bottom of the paragraph, how ironic.",25,Every Graph Tells a Story

27,Every Graph Tells a Story,chose to scale the vertical axis by a factor of 10 (so 2 represents 20 mph). Figure 1 shows a portion of Kiran’s story where he gave a plausible scenario for the linear increasing portion of the graph and then created a context where the nonlinear portion of the graph also made sense.,27,Every Graph Tells a Story
28,Every Graph Tells a Story,"Using a similar type of reasoning, ",28,Every Graph Tells a Story
29,Every Graph Tells a Story,"Ian, a seventh grader in Grosick’s class, created a story about Todd competing in an uphill bike race. Ian also used speed (mph) as his dependent variable and clearly described the linear decreasing portion of the graph by saying that Todd’s speed  went down by 1 mile per hour for each minute for two minutes. His story gave the reader enough information to calculate the slope of the line segment. A portion of Ian’s story is shown in ﬁ gure 2. ",29,Every Graph Tells a Story
30,Every Graph Tells a Story,"Charlie, another student in ",30,Every Graph Tells a Story
31,Every Graph Tells a Story,"Grosick’s class, was similarly detailed in his descriptions. Charlie’s context was a boy named Jimmy who left his basement bedroom for a late-night snack. Charlie chose his dependent variable to be height (in feet). In his story, he described how it took Jimmy 5 minutes to go up 3.5 feet of stairs to get his snack. Charlie seemed to realize that an average rate of change of 0.7 feet per minute was unreasonably slow, so he stated that the basement stairs were large, and Jimmy was tired and sluggish. Charlie also found a creative way to describe why Jimmy’s height at the end of the story was 1 foot lower than when he started by saying there was a trapdoor to a lower level even below the basement! See ﬁ gure 3 for Charlie’s story.",31,Every Graph Tells a Story
32,Every Graph Tells a Story,"Adriana and Lindsay, eighth- grade students in Robyn Wise’s class, worked together to create a story about a student reading a book. Their choice of dependent variable was number of pages (scaled by a factor of 10, so 2 represents 20 pages). Adriana and Lindsay successfully described the time and number of pages read for the fi rst portion of the graph, including having the book taken away by a teacher for reading in class (a plight that many voracious readers have experienced!) to explain the horizontal portion of the graph. Adriana and Lindsay’s teacher described how the two students worked together to fi gure out how to explain negative slope in terms of reading a book. Ultimately they decided that a negative slope could mean going back to reread certain sections of the book that they could not remember, so even though the time was later, the page numbers ",32,Every Graph Tells a Story

35,Every Graph Tells a Story,"Overall, the teachers were impressed with their students’ creativity, their willingness to deviate from the typical distance versus time  graph, and their attention to detail. Tracy Grosick commented, ",35,Every Graph Tells a Story
36,Every Graph Tells a Story,"Students took liberties in creating their stories to include definition  of both axes according to story fit. Interestingly, while some associated the passage of time with a victory over conflict, only to be defeated in the end, others ended their story as a final conclusion to an overall personal struggle of character. I was encouraged to note many of them had really dissected the y-axis units/rates to indicate detail in the story, rather than just use the axis as a gross measure or write in generalities.",36,Every Graph Tells a Story
