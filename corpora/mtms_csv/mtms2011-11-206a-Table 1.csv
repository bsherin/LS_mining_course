If the ribbon were supported on  posts 3 feet off the surface of Earth at the equator, how long would the ribbon need to be? What would be the area of the ribbon? How are these measurements different from those you found in question 2? posts 3 feet off the surface around Jupiter at the equator, how long would this ribbon need to be? What would be the area of this ribbon? How are these measurements different from those you found in question 4? 2. The circumference of Earth at the  equator is about 24,902 miles. What would be the area of ribbon needed to circle Earth at the equator if the ribbon were 6 inches wide? 4. Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system and consists mostly of gases. The diameter of Jupiter is 88,846 miles. What would be the area of 6-inch-wide ribbon circling Jupiter at its equator? 6. Challenge: Suppose you could  encircle each planet of our solar system at the equator with a ribbon, then could tie all those ribbons end to end. Would that ribbon be long enough to go around the circumference of the sun? (The sun’s radius is 432,169 miles.)  from the November 2011 issue of",3,mtms2011-11-206a,,

"Some students are likely to raise objections, which could derail the mathtematical discussion (e.g., How can he run around the equator when it is mostly water? When you tie the ribbons together, you use up some of the ribbon and shorten the total length. How can you place support poles in the middle of the ocean?) Teachers should emphasize at the start of this activity that the class is to pretend that these tasks can be completed and that they are to assume that Earth, the other planets, and the sun are perfect spheres that have smooth, solid surfaces.",6,mtms2011-11-206a,,

This amount increases the area by 0.5 ft. × 18.85 ft., or about 9.4 ft.2 Again, this result is likely to surprise students.

Since the circumference of Jupiter (Cj) is greater than the circumference of any of the other planets (we even included Pluto in our calculations),    9Cj > (Cme + Cv + Ce             + Cma + Cj + Cs                   + Cu + Cn + Cp).",45,mtms2011-11-206a,,
"  Thus, since the circumference of the sun is greater than nine of Jupiter’s circumferences, it must be larger than the sum of the circumferences of the nine planets.

"My seventh-grade algebra class completed this whole-class activity as an extension of a unit on functions. The class warmed up by creating a data table with values such as (0, 0), (2, 6.28), and (5, 15.7). The points were plotted, and the students quickly realized the relationship between the independent and the dependent variables. After a brief review of formulae associated with circles, the class was ready to begin. ",48,mtms2011-11-206a,,
"The students had previously  covered geology in science, and some immediately knew what was going on in the cartoon. Because they had used their graphing calculators for the introductory functions activity and for quickly answering the second question, the students wanted to use them  to answer the third question.",49,mtms2011-11-206a,,
"They did not want to think  through how to use an algebraic representation. After asking them to read through the rest of the questions to see the value in doing so, they were instructed to work on it for homework. Most of them returned with sketches to illustrate the concept, and some had ﬁ gured out how to use the 6p to answer the remaining questions more efﬁ ciently. Some students did not understand that the 2p could be distributed across the terms of (r + 3) until it was conﬁ rmed with their calculators that the two expressions were equivalent.",50,mtms2011-11-206a,,
This activity was a wonderful endof-year exercise in integrating several algebraic topics with geometry and was much better than some of the contrived examples of direct variation that students have seen during the year.,51,mtms2011-11-206a,,
