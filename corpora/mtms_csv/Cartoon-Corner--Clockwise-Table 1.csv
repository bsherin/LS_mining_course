18,"Cartoon Corner: Clockwise, but Not So Wise",You just signed your first contract to teach secondary math. You’re excited but you have many questions and concerns:  • What do I do when students don’t “get” the lesson? • What about students who struggle with math they supposedly learned in  elementary school? • How do absent students make up the work? • Do I assign seating or let students sit wherever they want? • Should I let students work in groups? • How much homework should I assign and grade?,18,"Cartoon Corner: Clockwise, but Not So Wise"
19,"Cartoon Corner: Clockwise, but Not So Wise","Based on classroom observations and interviews with seasoned and beginning teachers, Success from the Start: Your First Years Teaching",19,"Cartoon Corner: Clockwise, but Not So Wise"
20,"Cartoon Corner: Clockwise, but Not So Wise",Secondary Mathematics offers valuable suggestions to improve your teaching and your students’ opportunities to learn. The authors explore both the visible and invisible aspects of teaching and offer proven strategies to make the work meaningful—not merely manageable. Success from the start means being prepared from the start. This book not only teaches you how to be an effective math teacher but also gives you the tools to do it well. ,20,"Cartoon Corner: Clockwise, but Not So Wise"

24,"Cartoon Corner: Clockwise, but Not So Wise","The Drabble cartoon provided an excellent review of angles for my sixth-grade prealgebra students. They had little difficulty with the concept of a circle and had recently completed a geometry unit. Their favorite explanations revolved around problem 5 in which a screw was partially in a piece of wood, and you had to turn the screw 340 degrees clockwise. The first student explained, “Well you know, ‘righty tighty and lefty loosey,’ so it’s easy to picture what should be done!” Others added that, of course,  340 degrees would result in a screw being driven further into the wood because you are turning it a greater amount. Students who were unfamiliar with the operation of this simple machine will never forget “righty tighty and lefty loosey”! ",24,"Cartoon Corner: Clockwise, but Not So Wise"

28,"Cartoon Corner: Clockwise, but Not So Wise","I tested this cartoon with my seventh- grade prealgebra class. My class had no difficulty understanding the problems with this cartoon. They found them to be very easy, and it only took about fifteen minutes to complete the activity sheet. I would recommend adding some more questions to this task for Pi Day.",28,"Cartoon Corner: Clockwise, but Not So Wise"
29,"Cartoon Corner: Clockwise, but Not So Wise","I got the following problem from   a local college; perhaps something  like this could be added to make  the exercise more challenging. “In  the small European country of  Hendechtenstein, the clocks have numbers from 1 to 11 to reflect that its hours are 55 minutes in length. Both hands point straight up to  11 at midnight. How many minutes later will be the first time that the hands of the clock are together  again?”",29,"Cartoon Corner: Clockwise, but Not So Wise"

33,"Cartoon Corner: Clockwise, but Not So Wise","I had students from three different levels try this problem: a senior lowlevel-credit math recovery course, a junior algebra 2 course, and an AP Statistics course. Several students had difficulty figuring out what was being asked in problem 3. Some students found the answer to be unbelievable and assumed that some error had occurred in their understanding. For problem 4, a few English language learners had trouble deciphering the expression. ",33,"Cartoon Corner: Clockwise, but Not So Wise"
34,"Cartoon Corner: Clockwise, but Not So Wise","Students who missed problem 5 said that they did not have enough personal experience using screwdrivers to know which way would turn a screw in and which way would turn it out. They did not realize that the father in the cartoon was telling them which way. Some students in lower-level courses missed problem 6 because they did not recall how to find circumference, but all realized that they needed the circumference to solve the problem.",34,"Cartoon Corner: Clockwise, but Not So Wise"

38,"Cartoon Corner: Clockwise, but Not So Wise","My eighth-grade algebra students used this activity as a chance to review some middle school concepts before heading off to geometry the next year. As many of them had little to no experience with a screwdriver, we needed to discuss the humor behind the cartoon. From there, the students worked through all the questions in small groups and then presented their solutions to the class. ",38,"Cartoon Corner: Clockwise, but Not So Wise"
39,"Cartoon Corner: Clockwise, but Not So Wise","Many students readily admitted to  having difficulty with elapsed time. They shared their methods, often using mental math. Most of them counted forward, starting with the hours and then adding in the minutes. No one recalled ever having performed hand calculations by “borrowing”  60 minutes. There was disagreement about the answer to problem 6. They  were asked to find proof for their answers for class the next day, and all came back with the correct answer after having given it more thought. ",39,"Cartoon Corner: Clockwise, but Not So Wise"
40,"Cartoon Corner: Clockwise, but Not So Wise","As an extension, we used a trundle  wheel to talk about rotations greater than 360 degrees. After a few practice problems, we applied the concept to elapsed time. For example, if you start your homework at 7:00 and finish at 8:30, by how many degrees has the minute hand rotated? They decided it sounded more impressive to say that they had spent 540 degrees on an assignment.",40,"Cartoon Corner: Clockwise, but Not So Wise"
