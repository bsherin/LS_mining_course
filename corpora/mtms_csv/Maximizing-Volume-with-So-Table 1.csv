0,Maximizing Volume with Solids and Nets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"One of the most common household polyhedra is a cereal box. For over 100 years, American companies like Kelloggs have packaged cereal in containers shaped like rectangular prisms. Why is a rectangular prism the most commonly used solid for holding cereal? Would another design be equally or more efficient? Students will explore these and other questions in this open-ended measurement activity.",,
1,Maximizing Volume with Solids and Nets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"To analyze how to maximize volume, students will investigate a household container of their choice. They will measure its dimensions, draw a two-dimensional net to represent the three-dimensional solid, and determine its surface area and volume. They will also design alternative solids with the same volume but less surface area. At the close of this curriculum-embedded performance-based assessment activity, students will summarize their findings in a report format of their choosing.",,
2,Maximizing Volume with Solids and Nets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,This activity qualifies as an authentic performance task because it presents students with a real-world problem that is set within a context of realistic constraints and possibilities. It also measures students use of their knowledge and skills in new situations Wiggins and McTighe 2005).,,
3,Maximizing Volume with Solids and Nets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"According to the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSM), in grade 5, students explore volume by filling rectangular prisms with unit cubes (5.MD.C.4). In grade 6, they solve problems involving prisms with integer and fractional dimensions (6.G.A.2) and represent solid figures made of rectangles and triangles using two-dimensional nets. They then use the nets to help them determine the surface area of these figures (6.G.A.4). In grade 7, students solve real-world and math problems involving circles (7.G.B.4). In grade 8, they use their knowledge of circles to solve problems involving such circular solids as cylinders and spheres (8.G.C.9). Grade 8 students learn to apply the Pythagorean theorem to solve problems involving cones and pyramids (8.G.B.7). In high school geometry, students move into using volume formulas for cylinders, pyramids, cones, and spheres to solve problems (HSG.GMD.A.3) (CCSSI 2010). Although I used this activity with my ninth-grade geometry classes, it could be modified for lower grades.",,
4,Maximizing Volume with Solids and Nets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,BACKGROUND LEARNING EXPERIENCES,,
5,Maximizing Volume with Solids and Nets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"This nonroutine project, a culminating activity in a unit on solid geometry, requires students to employ higher-order thinking skills. Using mathematical discourse and discovery learning throughout the unit will help ensure that students gain an enduring understanding of the measurement concepts under study.",,
6,Maximizing Volume with Solids and Nets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Assigning background tasks will benefit students before this project begins. One such activity is finding the nets for a cube. Eleven distinct nets, or two-dimensional patterns, exist that when folded will form a cube. Use large square graph paper or commercial manipulatives such as Polydrons to help students find cube nets. For students who learn best with technology, NCTMs Illuminations site offers a webpage at http://illuminations.nctm.org/Activity .aspx?id=3544 that will allow students to interact with the nets for a cube. Giving students time to wrestle with such hands-on activities as working with solids and nets will help them learn to reason abstractly and quantitatively, which is one of the Standards for Mathematical Practice (SMP 2).",,
7,Maximizing Volume with Solids and Nets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Assigning other meaningful tasks before this activity commences can involve such sense-making processes as working with formulas and algorithms for surface area and volume of solids. These activities align with CCSSM, which states that students know the formulas for the volumes of cones, cylinders, and spheres and use them to solve real-world and mathematical problems (8.G.9; CCSSI 2010,  p. 56). The best way for students to know mathematical formulas is not to memorize but rather to derive them. For example, to help students remember the formula for the surface area of a sphere, cut an orange in half and show students the largest cross section of the sphere, the interior of a great circle. Outline four great circles using paper plates. Ask students to peel the orange into small pieces and cover the four great circles. Thus, the formula for the surface area for a sphere, SA = 4pr2, will make sense to students.",,

9,Maximizing Volume with Solids and Nets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,SPECIFICS OF THE MAXIMIZING VOLUME PROJECT,,
10,Maximizing Volume with Solids and Nets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Launch the project by showing students a container, such as a cereal box. Ask these questions:",,
11,Maximizing Volume with Solids and Nets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,What is the mathematical name for this object?,,
12,Maximizing Volume with Solids and Nets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,How many faces does it have?,,
13,Maximizing Volume with Solids and Nets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,What shapes make up the faces?,,
14,Maximizing Volume with Solids and Nets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,What is the difference between surface area and volume of this container?,,
15,Maximizing Volume with Solids and Nets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,How would we measure the  surface area of the container?,,
16,Maximizing Volume with Solids and Nets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,What is the process for finding the volume?,,
17,Maximizing Volume with Solids and Nets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Ask students to envision the net, or the two-dimensional flat piece of cardboard, that when folded will result in the three-dimensional container you are holding. Invite students to sketch a possible net for the container. Use a pair of scissors and cut along the edges to reveal the net. Discuss any excess manufacturing material that the net may have. Cut off and discard extraneous pieces so that students can see the mathematical net versus the manufacturing net. Discuss how the net can be used to determine the surface area and volume of the container. Engage students in a discussion about surface area as the sum of the area of all the faces included in the net.",,
18,Maximizing Volume with Solids and Nets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Ask students to conjecture why the product is packaged this way. Could another container hold the same amount but be shaped differently? Have students share their ideas of classifications of containers that would maximize the volume while minimizing surface area. Highlight the importance of this concept for manufacturing, keeping in mind profits and leftover material used in production.",,
19,Maximizing Volume with Solids and Nets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Distribute the activity sheet and rubric and give students these  instructions:,,
20,Maximizing Volume with Solids and Nets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,1. Complete a project to show  what you know about surface  area and volume.,,
21,Maximizing Volume with Solids and Nets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,2. Choose any container on which  to focus.,,
22,Maximizing Volume with Solids and Nets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,3. Measure the dimensions of the object using convenient units.,,
23,Maximizing Volume with Solids and Nets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,4. Draw a mathematical net for  the container and determine its surface area and volume.,,
24,Maximizing Volume with Solids and Nets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,5. Design other objects that have the same volume but require less surface area than the original  container.,,
25,Maximizing Volume with Solids and Nets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,6. Conjecture why the other objects have the same volume but less surface area.,,
26,Maximizing Volume with Solids and Nets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,7. Create a product to showcase your findings.,,
27,Maximizing Volume with Solids and Nets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"It will be time well spent to conduct a mock project in class before formally assigning the task so that students, working in groups, can experience a trial run (see fig. 1 for a sample mock project).",,
28,Maximizing Volume with Solids and Nets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
29,Maximizing Volume with Solids and Nets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,DIFFICULTIES ENCOUNTERED,,
30,Maximizing Volume with Solids and Nets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"One area of confusion related to the net. For example, the manufacturing net of a cereal box might comprise eight rectangular pieces, as opposed to the mathematical net of a rectangular prism, which has six faces. It is important to alert students to exclude any extraneous pieces of manufacturing material from their net. This project assesses students understanding of mathematical nets, which do not involve the overlap used in manufacturing.",,
31,Maximizing Volume with Solids and Nets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"A similar difficulty arose when students chose objects whose base or top was composed of two interconnected parts instead of one solid face. In this case, it is recommended that students tape the two linked pieces together to form one whole face.",,
32,Maximizing Volume with Solids and Nets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Another problem that students had was remembering to keep the volume, and not the surface area, constant.  For instance, a box with dimensions  10 in.  5 in.  12 in. would have a volume of 600 cubic inches and a surface area of 460 square inches.  The goal for students is to design  other containers that hold the same 600 cubic inches but have less surface area than 460 square inches. An error that several students made was keeping the 460 square inches constant and attempting to change the volume. It is important to reiterate to students that they need to keep the volume constant while varying the surface area.",,
33,Maximizing Volume with Solids and Nets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Several students had difficulty in simultaneously finding two dimensions of an alternative container that would yield the same volume as the original container. For example, a student designing a cylinder to hold 600 cubic inches might get stuck on what radius and height combination to use. Suggest that students assign a convenient radius to the cylinder, so that the only unknown dimension is the height.",,
34,Maximizing Volume with Solids and Nets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,EXTENSIONS,,
35,Maximizing Volume with Solids and Nets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Give students some cardboard with which to construct the physical container that will maximize volume and minimize surface area. They can then fill the original container with beans and dump them from the original container into the new container to show that it holds the same amount of contents.,,
36,Maximizing Volume with Solids and Nets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"They can use a R.A.F.T. writing strategy (Dean 2006) to write a letter to the manufacturer of the product, suggesting alternative container shapes for the product. With R.A.F.T., students consider various perspectives while writing: role of the writer (Who are you? a consumer); audience (To whom are you writing? a company); format (In what format are you writing? a business letter); topic (What are you writing about? a design for a container that would maximize volume while minimizing surface area).",,
37,Maximizing Volume with Solids and Nets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Research the profession of manufacturing process engineering. Invite an engineer to come to class to discuss specifics of the work that he or she does. Students can ask prescripted questions of the engineer to verify the mathematics that manufacturing engineers use in their work.,,

39,Maximizing Volume with Solids and Nets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I have assigned this project for two years and found that the second years products were of higher quality and mathematical precision than the first years. During the second year,  100 percent of my sixty geometry students turned in a project. I attribute the better results to the completion of the mock project.",,
40,Maximizing Volume with Solids and Nets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,The activitys exit prompt asked students to reflect on the value of completing a mock project in class. Student responses included these:,,
41,Maximizing Volume with Solids and Nets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I loved the mock project. It helped me greatly, because now I know exactly what to do at home.",,
42,Maximizing Volume with Solids and Nets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,I liked walking around and seeing other peoples work because it  allowed me to learn new ways to solve problems.,,
43,Maximizing Volume with Solids and Nets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,It helped me and now I am less likely to procrastinate because I know what Im doing.,,
44,Maximizing Volume with Solids and Nets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,I like the idea of the project. It lets me dig deeper because I am using the formulas to solve a real-life problem. I learn more in a project than filling in a bubble on a test.,,
45,Maximizing Volume with Solids and Nets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"When students perceive the relevance of an assignment, they will become more engaged. Research indicates that authentic tasks that involve choice and interest will yield more significant student learning outcomes. According to assessment expert Grant Wiggins (2014), authentic tasks offer realistic problems that target students preferences and interests. Moreover, authentic tasks allow students to work collaboratively and assess essential understandings.",,
46,Maximizing Volume with Solids and Nets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The solids and nets project embodies the elements of an authentic task. The projects components are known at the outset, and students work collaboratively and engage in rich discussion. Although it was more time-consuming to score sixty projects than run sixty forms through a scoring machine, it was enjoyable to assess them and provide feedback.",,
47,Maximizing Volume with Solids and Nets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"One student decided to revise and resubmit her project when she realized that she had some faulty understanding of the volume of her composite solid. Giving students time to use the rubric to assess another groups mock project paid off, resulting in higher-quality individual projects. One student created her project in the form of a storybook titled Chick Peas Mathematical Adventure (see fig. 2).",,
