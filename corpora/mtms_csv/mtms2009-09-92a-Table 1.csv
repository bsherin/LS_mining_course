Tasks that generate a need for mathematical intellect generate motivation and promote success in learning mathematics. Some specific tasks and ways to generate new ones are offered.,0,mtms2009-09-92a,,
"Provoking intellectual need aAccording to Harel’s Necessity Principle (1998), “Students are most likely to learn when they see a need for what we intend to teach them, where by ‘need’ is meant intellectual need [italics added], not social or economic need” (p. 501). The Necessity Principle is one of three pedagogical principles in Harel’s theoretical framework called DNR-based instruction, which stands for duality, necessity, and repeated reasoning (Harel 2007).  classroom and we hope that those we choose would engender discussions about new mathematical knowledge. Some teachers’ choice of activities might be more governed by the use of manipulatives, technology, or real-world problems. Other teachers might make choices that are driven by specific knowledge and skills that would arise on standardized tests. Although tasks should engage students and align with assessments, they should also cause students to grapple with the mathematics that we want them to learn.",1,mtms2009-09-92a,,

"For students to experience intellectual need, they must encounter a problem that they understand and appreciate. Harel (2007) refers to such a problem as being intrinsic to students. When students encounter a problem that reaches the limit of their existing knowledge, they will most likely experience an internal desire to resolve the situation; the resolution may lead to a modification of their existing knowledge or construction of new knowledge. In summary, a need-provoking task is designed so that students experience an intellectual need for a mathematical idea.",3,mtms2009-09-92a,,

",7,mtms2009-09-92a,,
"Task 3, on the other hand, lets  students experience the efficiency of using prime factorization as a way to compare products of numbers without actually computing each product. (Strictly speaking, the constraint of  not computing the product violates  the Necessity Principle, because students should be allowed to use whatever tools are available to them. One way to address this issue is to make the process of computation tedious. For example, change the set  of numbers in task 3 to the following set: (a) 52 • 6 • 1187 • 96; (b) 3 • 1185 • 25 • 442; (c) 1186 • 122 • 20 • 55; and  (d) 102 • 1184 • 222 • 33.)

Last, I discuss some practical suggestions for designing need-provoking tasks. I have worked with this framework in the mathematics courses that I teach to prospective elementary and middle school teachers.",15,mtms2009-09-92a,,
the need for PriMe factorization,16,mtms2009-09-92a,,
"Prime factorization allows us to uniquely characterize a number using its prime factors. Some textbooks  explain that a composite number can be expressed as a product of prime numbers (Billstein, Libeskind, and Lott 2007). They also explore prime numbers being building blocks of numbers (Beckmann 2005). They then present the procedure for finding the prime factorization of a number, either by making a factor tree or by working through repeated division with prime divisors. ",17,mtms2009-09-92a,,
"When concepts are developed  through a logical progression, tasks follow naturally. Task 1, at right, is typically given to students so that they can practice finding prime factorizations. Using the prime factorization of the number in task 2, students realize that all the factors can be listed systematically. Students may appreciate the usefulness of prime factorization for the sake of listing all the factors of a number. However, the need to express a number as a product of primes is not intrinsic for them, especially  different ways to solve the problem. For example, some students noticed the commonalities in parts (b) and (d) and showed that they are both equal to 33 • 50 • 22. However, many more compositions and decompositions are needed to determine the equivalence, if any, among parts (a), (b), and (c). ",18,mtms2009-09-92a,,
"Having experienced the haphazardness of this approach, students might appreciate the direct method of expressing each product as being a product of primes to compare values. Students might also realize that the efficiency of this method is related to the uniqueness of prime factorization, except possibly for the order of factors. This realization can help them appreciate the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. Furthermore, this task promotes a desirable way of thinking that is common in science: breaking down entities into their building blocks. Just as elements are building blocks of matter and amino acids are building blocks of protein, prime factors are building blocks of numbers.  the need for the least coMMon MultiPle",19,mtms2009-09-92a,,
"Students experience the need to find the least common multiple when they have to add fractions with unlike denominators for the first time. Most preservice mathematics teachers already know that finding the least common denominator is a step in the standard algorithm for adding or subtracting fractions. Hence, it is often necessary to use other tasks for them to appreciate the meaning of least common multiple. ",20,mtms2009-09-92a,,
"Task 4 is considered a typical problem for introducing the least common multiple. Students can solve it by acting out the problem; subsequently, they understand why the answer is called the least common multiple. Task 5 is a visual aid to help students see why the least common multiple of  4 and 6 is 12. Although these tasks ",21,mtms2009-09-92a,,

"The least common multiple is needed to complete task 6 but not  in an obvious manner. Questions (a) and (b) allow students to apply their understanding of division as partitioning. Most students could solve these first two parts rather easily by dividing the smaller circle into six equal segments and the larger circle into ten  equal segments. When asked question (c), involving a much larger number, eleven students extended the idea for solving (b) (see fig. 1). For example, this student divided 179 by 10 and 179 by 6 to obtain a remainder of 9 and 5, respectively. He correctly located the positions for the two dots, except that his calculations incorrectly determined the color of each dot on each track. This third part of the task asked  students to use common multiples to determine the times when the two dots exchange tracks. The remaining twelve students found that the two colored dots switched tracks every 30 seconds and reasoned with multiples of 30 to track the color of the dot on each circle (see figs. 2a and 2b). When figure 2b was presented on the board, most students realized the significance of 30 seconds as the least common multiple.",32,mtms2009-09-92a,,
"Practical suggestions Tasks 3 and 6 were each designed to help students experience the need for prime factorization and the least common multiple, respectively. The ideas for designing need-provoking tasks can come from many sources, including historical development of a mathematical concept; activities and lessons available on the Internet, such  as those at illuminations.nctm.org; test items in standardized tests; and tasks in textbooks, resource materials, and journals. The inspiration for designing need-provoking tasks usually results from dissatisfaction with some mathematical tasks as well as appreciation for others. For example, the idea for task 3 emerged from my appreciation for this task:  fig. 1 this student used remainders to determine the position of the dots, resulting in the correct position, but not the correct color, of each dot.  fig. 2 these students used a common multiple and correctly located the two dots’ position at the 179th second.",33,mtms2009-09-92a,,

"It gave me the idea that products of numbers can be compared by simply re-factoring the products. For students to experience the need for prime factorization, rather than any factorization, I increased the number of products for comparison from two to four. In general, most of my ideas for need-provoking tasks emerge from selecting and analyzing mathematical tasks for classroom use.",36,mtms2009-09-92a,,
"When designing a task so that  students experience a need for a new mathematical idea, I consider the level of difficulty associated with the mathematical idea, students’ existing knowledge, and the characteristics of the task. ",37,mtms2009-09-92a,,
"In the initial design of task 6, the  dots do not exchange tracks when they meet. The question became this: “After how many seconds will the two dots meet for the eleventh time?” The need to find the least common multiple is more obvious in the initial version, which, like task 4, may be more appropriate for fifth graders who are encountering the concept of least common multiple for the first time. For preservice teachers, the impact on their learning would probably be greater if they experience the need for finding common multiples and the efficiency of using the least common multiple to solve the problem. ",38,mtms2009-09-92a,,
"Question (c) of task 6 was designed with this purpose in mind. Questions (a) and (b) were included to ensure that all students understood the problem so that part (c) would be meaningful. A large number, such as 179, was chosen for (c) so that students could appreciate the efficiency of reasoning with multiples of 30 as opposed to reasoning  how does Your  task stack up? when analyzing a particular task, consider the following questions:  1. what mathematical learning can the task potentially provoke? 2. is the task intrinsic to students? 3. will students experience a limitation of their existing knowledge and a  need for the new mathematical idea in order to solve the problem?  if the answers to the latter two questions are no, then try to modify the task or design a new task so that the answers become yes. For example, task 5 allows students to see why the least common multiple of 4 and 6 is 12, whereas task 6 lets student experience the need for finding the least common multiple to solve the problem. Mathematical activities and tasks are often designed for students to see a certain mathematical idea or practice a certain procedure. according to the Necessity principle, however, students must experience  the intellectual need for an idea or a procedure to really learn it.",39,mtms2009-09-92a,,

"To reinforce the usefulness of  prime factorization experienced in task 3, students subsequently work on finding the number of factors of a large number, such as 7560. For example, by expressing 7560 as  23 • 33 • 5 • 7, students can generate all its factors by multiplying four factors, one from each of the four sets of factors: {20, 21, 22, 23}, {30, 31, 32, 33},  {50, 51} and {70, 71}.

I am also unable to necessitate every single piece of mathematical knowledge because of limited class time as well as my lack of knowledge of my students’ current understanding. ,55,mtms2009-09-92a,,

in conclusion,57,mtms2009-09-92a,,
"The purpose of an intellectual-needprovoking task is to allow students to use their existing knowledge to solve a problem, feel challenged because of the limitation of their existing knowledge, and experience the need for the target knowledge to solve the problem. Designing need-provoking tasks may not be easy. However, it is rewarding when we see students appreciate the mathematics that we want them to learn. This is particularly true when it stems from their engagement with the tasks that we have designed. Hence, teachers should challenge themselves and plan their lessons with the Necessity Principle in mind. ",58,mtms2009-09-92a,,
