One student insisted that you should multiply, so I asked her, “How many AUs are in 300,000,000 km?” She promptly answered, “Two,” and said she multiplied. I then asked, “Does 300,000,000 × 150,000,000 = 2?” She said, “No; I meant I added.” So I asked, “Does 300,000,000 + 150,000,000 = 2?” A very puzzled expression was followed by the “aha!” moment when she realized that division was required.",53,Cartoon Corner: Math Thats Out of This World

55,Cartoon Corner: Math Thats Out of This World,"The Challenge problem was assigned as homework. Students demonstrated the ability to transfer the data to a number line. Some tried to incorporate relative sizes of the planets and discovered that they really did not have those data.

59,Cartoon Corner: Math Thats Out of This World,"My eighth-grade geometry students completed this activity. I particularly enjoyed the cartoon itself because it caused some of my students to do Internet searches for astronomy and astrology soon after reading it, and it opened discussions in their groups about these terms. Being top students, they are not used to being scared of math, so the humor was a bit lost on them. ",59,Cartoon Corner: Math Thats Out of This World
60,Cartoon Corner: Math Thats Out of This World,"The Challenge problem brought a very nice conclusion to their work, making them carefully discuss the best strategy for drawing the scale model. In the context of the course, we had already spoken about distance (from a point to a line, a line to a line, and so on) and also discussed distances from points of concurrency of a triangle to sides and vertices. The cartoon allowed a discussion of a different type of distance. ",60,Cartoon Corner: Math Thats Out of This World
61,Cartoon Corner: Math Thats Out of This World,"My students raised questions as to how the value of 1 AU was computed and consequently the average distance from each planet (including Earth) to the sun.

",61,Cartoon Corner: Math Thats Out of This World
62,Cartoon Corner: Math Thats Out of This World,"Students in geometry need to get a  glimpse of non-Euclidean geometry. Discussions of space can be used as a  doorway to this content, and at the beginning of the year, this cartoon activity can be used as a good introduction. In addition, other classes, like prealgebra, can benefit from these questions, especially the Challenge problem. I have seen more than one middle school student draw a time line for their social studies class in which the divisions were equidistant, regardless of the year expanse between events. With these issues and classes in mind, this cartoon would be an excellent activity for an interdisciplinary discussion. ",62,Cartoon Corner: Math Thats Out of This World
