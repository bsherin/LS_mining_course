"Paper folding is fun, but where is the  math? Unless teachers develop lessons that address mathematical objectives, origami could be nothing more than a cute activity.

Making the Cube,25,mtms2011-02-354a,,
Any square piece of paper can be used to fold the basic unit for this cube.  Begin the activity with 8-inch squares that have been cut from standard  8 1/2 in. × 11 in. paper. Each student folds six squares and puts the units together to form a cube (see fig. 2).,26,mtms2011-02-354a,,
"Building the cube will generate questions, many involving measurement. Even though the paper used for the units was an 8-inch square, the resulting cube does not have an edge of length 8 inches. What is the length of an edge of the cube? Students could use rulers, but other methods can enhance their understanding. Questions for students to consider include these: •  What if the size of the paper  changed? •  Is volume a function of the size of  the paper? •  Does doubling the size of the  original square double the volume? •  If we used 4-inch squares of paper  (instead of 8-inch squares), how would the volume change? •  If we used 16-inch squares of paper, how would the volume change?  •  How would the area of the face of  the cube change?  •  How would the length of the cube  change?",27,mtms2011-02-354a,,
"Fig. 2 A cube can be formed from  6 squares of origami paper.  students use beans to measure the volume of their cubes, then record the data in a table. ",28,mtms2011-02-354a,,
Determining Volume,29,mtms2011-02-354a,,
"The first investigation involves the volume of the cubes that students constructed. The question posed is something like this:  The volume of the cube that has been constructed depends on the size of the original square of paper; 8-inch squares were used. How would the volume change if different-sized squares of paper were used? For example, if the original square were cut in half (so that the paper is half the size), would the volume be half, as well?",30,mtms2011-02-354a,,
"Students then work in groups, making cubes from various sizes of paper— from squares that are 3, 4, 5, 5.5, 6, 7, and 8 inches. Every student does not make every size of cube, but each group makes a few samples. Students then determine the volumes of the cubes. By working in groups, students can construct cubes and measure their volume in one class period.",31,mtms2011-02-354a,,
Counting the Volume,32,mtms2011-02-354a,,
"Students determine the volume in two ways: by measuring (1) with a nonstandard unit and (2) with calculations. First, because some students do not have a solid understanding of the concept of volume—as filling an empty space, for example—they can use beans to fill each cube and then  count the beans in each. The process does not take long. It is interesting to see how accurate this method is and if it shows the relation between volume and length of the original square of paper that was folded. ",33,mtms2011-02-354a,,
"Although a nonstandard unit, beans  illustrate the concept of “filling” as a way to model volume. Further, beans are concrete and accessible to students with a variety of abilities. I have used beans large enough to count yet not so large as to cause errors because they create gaps when filling a container. Smaller beans could be used, as could other materials, but they would require additional time to count. An interesting question is how differences in materials affect the analysis. The volume would change numerically, but would the functional relation change? The use of a nonstandard unit supports the idea that volume is not always measured with a standard cubic unit. ",34,mtms2011-02-354a,,
"After filling the cubes and counting beans, students gather data and average them for each cube. Table 1 shows the information collected during the bean-counting process. The numbers are averages of several groups’ measurements. Students observe patterns in a table. Because the class has discussed direct relations, they wonder if this is such a pattern. Does doubling the length of the original square of paper double the resulting volume? The pattern in  table 1 Using beans as a nonstandard unit, students measure the volume of different sizes of cubes.",35,mtms2011-02-354a,,

•  What angles are formed by these  fold lines?  •  The face of the cube is hidden in  these fold lines. Where is it?,39,mtms2011-02-354a,,
"After some discussion, students usually recognize that the square in the middle is the face of the cube (see fi g. 5a). Students can fi nd the area of that square and determine the length of its side. Knowing the length will yield the volume. Generally, students use several methods to fi nd the area. One method is described below:   I can divide the square into 5 squares (they form a pentomino, or X), and the 4 triangles (the corners) form another square, and the triangles in the middle of each edge together form 2 more squares, yielding 8 squares together. Therefore, since the original square is 64 square inches, the middle square will be 1/8 of that, or 8 square units (see fi g. 5b).",40,mtms2011-02-354a,,
"Other students divide the entire square into triangles (see fi g. 5a). They then reason that because there are 32 triangles and the big square is 64 square inches, each of those triangles is 2 square inches. The square in the middle would comprise 4, or a total of 8, square inches.",41,mtms2011-02-354a,,
"the table is not easy to discern, but students can see that it is not a direct relation. ",42,mtms2011-02-354a,,
"During the year, my students spend a lot of time representing patterns in three ways: using a table, writing an equation, and constructing a graph. It is natural, then, for them to graph the information from this table. They graph the data and observe that this relationship is obviously not linear (see fi g. 3). At this point, students are not ready to fi nd the equation, but they are ready to look mathematically at the problem. To do so, they “uncover” the fold lines hidden in the folded unit.",43,mtms2011-02-354a,,
Calculating the Volume,44,mtms2011-02-354a,,
"Unfolding the original unit reveals the mathematics of the polyhedra. My goal is to use the creases in the unfolded origami paper to fi nd the volume of the cube, although other signifi cant mathematics lies underneath this folded unit and could be used to extend this activity (see fi g. 4).",45,mtms2011-02-354a,,
Many questions can be posed: •  Are the fold lines symmetrical? What  kind of symmetry do they have?  •  Many polygons are formed. How  many can you fi nd?  •  Some of these polygons are  squares. How many do you see? ,46,mtms2011-02-354a,,
"Some students use the Pythagorean theorem to fi nd the measurements. They then demonstrate their thinking and their methods. In most cases, they are correct, but occasionally some misunderstandings are uncovered, which is good. Many valid methods can be used to fi nd the required measurements, and all creative methods should be encouraged.",47,mtms2011-02-354a,,
"Students fi nd that the area in the middle is always 1/8 of the original square paper. This leads them to discover a pattern that extends to other sizes of square paper. The area of a face of the cube, therefore, is always 1/8 of the area of the original paper square.  ",48,mtms2011-02-354a,,
"A second pattern that develops is the relationship between the side of a square face and its length. The root of the square’s area, or the square’s root, provides that connection. We generalize these patterns for a variety of original square lengths and fi nd the volume by cubing the length. We also emphasize the common assertion in algebra that patterns and generalizations come from the problem, not from guessing. Seeing connections will lead to understanding patterns.",49,mtms2011-02-354a,,

The answer lies in the relationship between cubic units and beans as a unit of volume. Students compare the numbers in the tables for volume in “bean” units with the volume in cubic-inch units. That ratio turns out to be approximately 35. This is the factor that students had tried as an expansion of the function. The equation   35 works well and is graphed in ﬁ gure 6. The initial volumes, measured with beans, match fairly closely the volume function that was found algebraically.",60,mtms2011-02-354a,,

"One of many extensions for this activity—and a use for all the cubes that students produce—is the construction of a fractal in three dimensions called Sierpinski’s carpet. Fractals connect well to the study of traditional mathematical topics. Studying measurement (especially of volume) and fi nding patterns (specifi cally, exponential ones) are two topics among many that this extension involves. After students discover the patterns in Pascal’s triangle and investigate Sierpinski’s triangle and its connections to exponential patterns, they can next consider the Sierpinski carpet that is based on squares rather than equilateral triangles. This fractal is generated by taking a square, cutting out the middle, and then repeating this process many times. Stage 0 is simply a square; stages 1 and 2 are shown in fi gure 7. ",62,mtms2011-02-354a,,
"Students then extend this square  pattern to a pattern of cubes. This process leads to a three-dimensional model of Sierpinski’s carpet. Stage 0 would be a solid cube; stages 1 and 2 are shown in fi gure 8. The models provide a context for exploring more patterns, specifi cally, exponential pat- terns. We build a table and extend it to the general case; table 3 shows the percentage of the volume of Sierpinski’s carpet, in three dimensions, which would be fi lled with cubes. ",63,mtms2011-02-354a,,
"In the table, if the image at a stage gets very large, the number of squares, as a percent of the total volume, gets very small. Thought of another way, as the cube gets very large, it becomes dominated more by the empty space than by the smaller cubes.  sUMMaRY",64,mtms2011-02-354a,,
"Principles and Standards for School Mathematics (2000) calls for students to solve problems, reason and communicate their solutions, and connect mathematical ideas.
