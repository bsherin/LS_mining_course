0,Creating Inequalities from Real-World Experiences - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Linear inequalities can be particularly challenging for middle school students to understand, solve, and construct. Students often treat inequalities as equations and expect that only one value will make the inequality true. This “single number answer” tendency is widespread and persists even after instruction (Vaiyavutjamai and Clements 2006). Additionally, when students solve inequalities, they often focus on manipulating symbols and do not think holistically about meaning and the reasonableness of solutions. Writing inequalities (or equations) to represent contextualized scenarios is also challenging; such errors as reversing variables and incorrectly representing relationships between quantities are common (MacGregor and Stacey 1993).",,
1,Creating Inequalities from Real-World Experiences - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"That said, presenting algebraic problems verbally, in a story problem format, has been shown to support problem-solving success. Students are more likely to reason about contextualized problems holistically and are less likely to rely on rote symbolic manipulation (Nathan and Koedinger 2000). These likelihoods suggest that one way to address some of the challenges in learning linear inequalities is to use contextualized tasks. The following pedagogical strategies, illustrated with vignettes from Ms. K.’s seventh-grade classroom, supported students as they drew on real-world contexts and experiences to deepen their understanding of linear inequalities. Specifically, Ms. K. designed the set of lessons with the dual mathematical goals of having students (a) construct linear inequalities to represent contextualized situations and (b) solve inequalities accurately.",,
2,Creating Inequalities from Real-World Experiences - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,STRATEGY 1: PROMOTE HOLISTIC REASONING ABOUT INEQUALITIES,,
3,Creating Inequalities from Real-World Experiences - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Ms. K. began by eliciting students’ understandings of key mathematical terms (i.e., equal, inequality), a strategy supported by research on how to effectively launch complex tasks (Jackson et al. 2012). She explained, “I want them to generate the definitions first so that it’s more memorable.” To support student understanding of symbolic representations of inequalities, Ms. K. wrote the inequality 2a
        > 5 and asked students to discuss what whole number(s) could be substituted for the variable to make the inequality true. This is consistent with an open-sentence approach to teaching equations and inequalities, wherein students reason about the set of values that makes the sentence true (Ellerton and Clements 2011). Many students used a guess-and-check strategy and realized that any whole number 3 or larger would satisfy the inequality.",,
4,Creating Inequalities from Real-World Experiences - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Next, Ms. K. asked students to represent solutions symbolically. Most students drew on experiences solving equations and recorded individual solutions (e.g., a = 5, a = 3, etc.). When a student suggested that they could continue to list possible solutions, Ms. K. noted, “That would take a long time, and in mathematics we look for efficiency.” One student suggested using a greater-than sign to represent solutions (i.e., a
        > 3), but others argued that a could also equal 3. Ms. K. then introduced notation for greater than or equal to—a ≥ 3—and represented the solution on a number line (see fig. 1). Ms. K.’s open-sentence approach to inequalities supported holistic reasoning and addressed common misconceptions, such as that variables represent single number solutions rather than multiple values (Vaiyavutjamai and Clements 2006).",,

6,Creating Inequalities from Real-World Experiences - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,STRATEGY 2: CONSTRUCT INEQUALITIES TO MODEL REAL-WORLD SCENARIOS,,
7,Creating Inequalities from Real-World Experiences - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Ms. K. also connected inequalities to familiar, relevant contexts, a strategy that is known to support diverse students’ learning. First, she asked students when they might see inequalities in real life. Students generated examples based on shopping, such as comparing prices of cereal to purchase the cheapest option. Ms. K. honored and skillfully reframed these contributions to support lesson goals:",,
8,Creating Inequalities from Real-World Experiences - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Ms. K.: Here is how we could make it work. You could say we are buying cereal and the store brand is $3 per box and everything else is more [i.e., the price of other brands is greater than $3/box], so we know we are going to spend $3 or more.",,
9,Creating Inequalities from Real-World Experiences - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Next, Ms. K. shared a video of a twelve-year-old girl who was actively protesting her state’s voter pre-registration age (Byler and Park 2013). The girl campaigned to reinstate a law that allowed sixteen-year-olds and seventeen-year-olds to preregister so that if they turned 18 just before an election, they could vote. Ms. K. chose this video because the girl was close in age to her students, and she knew activities like voting were of interest to them. She then discussed how inequalities could be used to represent the current and desired voter preregistration age:",,
10,Creating Inequalities from Real-World Experiences - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Ms. K.: What is changing in the situation?,,
11,Creating Inequalities from Real-World Experiences - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Student: Age.,,
12,Creating Inequalities from Real-World Experiences - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Ms. K.: What could we use as a variable?,,
13,Creating Inequalities from Real-World Experiences - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Student:A.,,
14,Creating Inequalities from Real-World Experiences - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Ms. K.: The actual [preregistration] age right now is eighteen. But what does she want it to be?,,
15,Creating Inequalities from Real-World Experiences - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Student: Less.,,
16,Creating Inequalities from Real-World Experiences - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Student: Yeah, the age is more than she wants it to be.",,
17,Creating Inequalities from Real-World Experiences - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Ms. K.: So this is the inequality that she wants [A ≥ 16, where A represents the voter preregistration age] and this is the inequality that she has [A ≥ 18].",,
18,Creating Inequalities from Real-World Experiences - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Ms. K. then asked students to discuss situations in their lives that they wanted to change and to represent those situations using inequalities. Examples included reducing movie ticket prices or monthly rent, making college tuition more affordable, and changing how manufacturers filled bags of chips (see table 1).",,
19,Creating Inequalities from Real-World Experiences - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
20,Creating Inequalities from Real-World Experiences - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Students argued that chip bags were at most half full, but they should be at least 3/4 full. Ms. K. helped students represent this scenario using inequalities. She began with C ≤ 1/2, where C represented the current fullness of a bag of chips. Students discussed that the current fullness was 1/4 less than the desired fullness (D), which they recorded as C = D – 1/4. Drawing on experiences solving equations, students used substitution to rewrite and solve the inequality in terms of the desired fullness (i.e., D – 1/4 ≤ 1/2, and by adding 1/4 to each side, D ≤ 3/4). Throughout this example, Ms. K. drew students’ attention to the specific meaning of each variable, thus helping address challenges that students often face that are related to imprecise variable definition (Stacey and MacGregor 1999). Additionally, students used the context to reason about the relationships represented in different equations and inequalities. For example, they concluded that C = D + 1/4 was an incorrect equation because the current fullness was actually less than, not greater than, the desired fullness. Students also used the context to evaluate whether the solution (D ≤ 3/4) made sense.",,
21,Creating Inequalities from Real-World Experiences - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,STRATEGY 3: DISTINGUISHING INEQUALITIES AND EQUATIONS,,
22,Creating Inequalities from Real-World Experiences - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"As students constructed inequalities, some struggled to determine whether inequalities or equations would best represent their selected scenario. To support understanding, Ms. K. focused students’ attention on the difference between instances of equality (e.g., two quantities have the same value) and inequality (e.g., comparing quantities using 
        <, >, ≤ or ≥). For example, one student used equations to represent the number of daily homework assignments (H = 2; H = 4). Ms. K. guided the student to consider how she could use inequalities instead:",,
23,Creating Inequalities from Real-World Experiences - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Ms. K: You get 4 [assignments] every single day?,,
24,Creating Inequalities from Real-World Experiences - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Student: Well, no, sometimes it’s 1.",,
25,Creating Inequalities from Real-World Experiences - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Ms. K: Okay, so it can be less than 4. You’re not stuck at 4 all the time. You want the most to be 2, but are you okay with 1 assignment?",,
26,Creating Inequalities from Real-World Experiences - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Student: Yeah.,,
27,Creating Inequalities from Real-World Experiences - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Ms. K: Then you’re fine with less than 2. It doesn’t have to be equal.,,
28,Creating Inequalities from Real-World Experiences - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,The student then wrote an inequality to represent her desired scenario: H ≤ 2 assignments per day. Students often overgeneralize experiences with equations as they learn inequalities. This makes it challenging to interpret variables as representing multiple values—an interpretation that is key to understanding inequalities. Ms. K’s explicit attention to ways that equations and inequalities could model real-world situations helped students differentiate these key concepts.,,
29,Creating Inequalities from Real-World Experiences - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,STRATEGY 4: INTERPRETING RESULTS,,
30,Creating Inequalities from Real-World Experiences - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Students also faced challenges solving inequalities and interpreting solutions. Ms. K. encouraged students to reason holistically about the meaning of inequalities and to use contexts to evaluate whether resulting answers made sense. In an example concerning the price of gas, students started with the current price, G = 2.99, where G represented the cost of a gallon of gasoline. To represent a desired decrease of at least $0.30 per gallon, they wrote an inequality involving subtraction (G – 0.30 ≤ 2.99). The students’ error reflected a tendency to directly translate words to symbols when writing equations and inequalities (“gas price decreases by $0.30 per gallon” becomes “G – 0.30”) as well as misunderstandings about relationships among quantities (MacGregor and Stacey 1993). Ms. K. then asked students to solve the inequality and reason about the result. Students realized that the solution reflected a possible increase in cost—(G ≤ 3.29)—the opposite of their desired change. They revised the inequality so that the cost per gallon plus $0.30 would be less than or equal to the current price (G + 0.30 ≤ 2.99).",,
31,Creating Inequalities from Real-World Experiences - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Ms. K.’s scaffolded questioning style developed as students struggled to symbolically represent their desired changes (e.g., decreasing prices). She explained:",,
32,Creating Inequalities from Real-World Experiences - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I saw kids struggle; they didn’t know what they were adding or where they were taking away. . . . The way I started phrasing it was, “Well, how much more is it right now than what you want it to be? They could see that right now it’s more; they want it to be less.",,
33,Creating Inequalities from Real-World Experiences - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"These prompts helped students reason about inequalities holistically and to revise inconsistencies between contexts and symbolic models. In this way, Ms. K. addressed a common tendency to rely on rote symbolic manipulation when solving inequalities and equations, instead of meanings (Nathan and Koedinger 2000).",,
34,Creating Inequalities from Real-World Experiences - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,TIPS FOR CLASSROOM PRACTICE,,
35,Creating Inequalities from Real-World Experiences - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Mathematizing the World,,
36,Creating Inequalities from Real-World Experiences - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Ms. K. designed this lesson to support student understanding of inequalities and to “give math a purpose” for students. By mathematizing situations in their lives, students moved beyond solving textbook inequalities to using mathematics as a tool to represent and reason about real-world situations. Students were so engaged in discussing the pros and cons of their proposed changes that Ms. K asked them to write persuasive letters that explained the issues and showed how they could be represented symbolically. Teachers can enact this practice by first asking students to identify topics of interest in their lives (e.g., youth activism, video game prices). Students can pose questions about these topics, and brainstorm ways that mathematics could be used to represent or better understand the situations (e.g., How can we use equations or inequalities?).",,
37,Creating Inequalities from Real-World Experiences - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Beyond the Textbook,,
38,Creating Inequalities from Real-World Experiences - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Ms. K. consulted her curriculum when planning this lesson and found examples that were not immediately relatable to students (e.g., fabric needed for a quilt). Therefore, she decided to incorporate outside resources that reflected high-interest scenarios. Ms. K. reasoned that by connecting to students in her initial lessons on inequalities, she would not only enhance engagement and understanding but also show students that math matters in their lives. (Teachers might consult resources such as Real World Math, Radical Math, Get the Math, and Mathalicious for additional examples of Common Core-aligned mathematics lessons that include real-world connections.)",,
39,Creating Inequalities from Real-World Experiences - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Focus on Meaning,,
40,Creating Inequalities from Real-World Experiences - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"When students’ examples did not neatly map onto inequalities, Ms. K. found ways to acknowledge students’ ideas and connect them to her mathematical goals (i.e., the homework example). By modeling ways to think about contexts flexibly in terms of inequalities rather than just equations and by encouraging students to reason holistically about possible solutions to inequalities, she supported student understanding of a challenging topic and addressed some of the challenges noted in prior research.",,
