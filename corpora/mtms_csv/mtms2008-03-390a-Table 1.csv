"Jennifer B. Chauvot and Sharon L. D. Benson d“Data-driven decision making” is a  phrase that is now commonplace in educational conversations. It is used when school districts discuss strategies to help meet the needs of all students while closing the achievement gap between subgroups of students. Within mathematics education, there is a growing need to educate prospective and practicing mathematics teachers about No Child Left Behind accountability measures and corresponding data within a given state in a way that emphasizes meaningful mathematics instruction that is consistent with national recommendations (NCTM 2000). Given pressures that teachers face within ",2,mtms2008-03-390a,,

She is interested in the role of proportionality in curriculum and instruction as well as the proportional reasoning strategies used by students and teachers.  high-stakes teaching environments, it is important to analyze assessment tools, such as state-mandated tests, in an efficient, enlightened manner. A goal of such an analysis is to acknowledge accountability through constructive discourse while continuing to emphasize good mathematics teaching. Such discourse about accountability can take on many forms (Chauvot 2006). This article shares card-sorting activities that use items from state-mandated tests with prospective and practicing mathematics teachers. These activities give teachers tools to further accountability measures while exploring reformminded mathematics instruction. ",3,mtms2008-03-390a,,
"Card-sort activities capitalize on classification and the notions of example and nonexample when defining concepts. For example, the Roping in Quadrilaterals activity (Gavin, Belkin, Spinelli, and St. Marie 2001) provides a structure in which students explore the properties and characteristics of quadrilaterals. In this activity, students are given sixteen quadrilateral pieces and a series of tasks. Students are asked to sort the pieces according to specified criteria, such as “at least one right angle” and “no right angles,” or “all sides the same length” and “at least one acute angle.” These sorting tasks then lead to students’ understanding the classification of quadrilaterals as  rectangles, squares, rhombuses, and so on. A variation of this activity would be to give students a subset of the sixteen pieces (two rectangles, two squares, and a rhombus that is not a square) and ask students to sort into three piles, defining the criteria for each pile. In either example, whether students are given the criteria or asked to define the criteria, they must focus on necessary properties and characteristics for defining concepts.",4,mtms2008-03-390a,,
"In a similar way, card-sorting  activities for preservice and practicing teachers that involve released statemandated test items provide opportunities to explore topics in mathematics education. Topics include attributes  of algebraic reasoning, proportional reasoning, problem solving, multiple representations, connections, and assessment. These activities also afford opportunities for teachers to explore students’ mathematical thinking and conceptual understanding. ",5,mtms2008-03-390a,,

"28 28 28 (see www.tea.state.tx.us/teks/index .html). Cards are created so that the assessment item is on one side of the card and the objective and corresponding student expectation, as reported by the state, is on the other side. Figure 1 illustrates an example of a card. Figure 2 lists the six objectives that are assessed by the TAKS. When creating sorting tasks, it is  important to focus on one or two goals while judiciously selecting assessment items for the given task. For example, two goals of an activity might be to instruct teachers (1) how the assessment objectives are defined by the state and (2) how some items might seemingly assess more than one objective. As teachers sort assessment items according to their experience and insight, discussions occur regarding attributes of objectives and the alignment of assessment items to those attributes.  naMe that oBJectiVe",19,mtms2008-03-390a,,
"In one activity, teachers are asked to sort nine cards by objective (see appendix A); they are permitted to choose more than  one objective for an item and must be prepared to provide a rationale for their decisions. Six of the nine cards reasonably align with objectives 1 through 6, respectively. Teachers match these cards with the corresponding objective (see fig. 2) with relative ease and develop a sense of what is intended by each objective. The remaining cards, 9, 18, and 40 (in appendix A) often stimulate discussion regarding potential alignment with multiple objectives. For example, it is reasonable to argue that card 9 measures objective 2 (algebraic reasoning) and objective 4 (measurement) because the item is about patterns displayed in a table format (objective 2) of angle measures (objective 4). Because the choices are about the pattern, teachers may align the assessment item to objective 2. In fact, according to the state classification, this item measures a student expectation found within objective 6 (problem solving). This classification furthers the notion that making conjectures from patterns can be considered both algebraic thinking and an aspect of problem solving, and that problem solving is assessed in several mathematical contexts, such as geometry and measurement. ",20,mtms2008-03-390a,,
"Card 18 is often identified by teachers as assessing objective 4, a measurement item; however, this item is identified as assessing a student expectation found within objective 1 (numbers and operations), in which students are expected to estimate values of irrational numbers. Teachers report frustration when trying to sort this item into a specific objective because the alignment with objective 1 assumes that students were thinking about an irrational number when in fact students may have used the formula for the area of a square (a measurement concept) to simply square each choice to find a value closest to 83 square meters. ",21,mtms2008-03-390a,,
"Card 40 is typically identified as  assessing ideas found within objective 2 because the student must choose a symbolic representation of a verbal  description, essentially translating among representations. Although teachers recognize that objective 1 also applies, it is typically not their first choice in the sorting process.",22,mtms2008-03-390a,,
"This sorting activity leads teachers to realize that the process of classifying items by objective involves assumptions about students’ mathematical thinking. Students may apply strategies to successfully solve problems that may not necessarily align with the state’s reported student expectation alignment. Accordingly, the examination of the assessment items deepens conversations about data generated by an item. Care should be taken when drawing conclusions about a student’s understanding of a specific objective when he or she may or may not have used strategies specific to that objective. Additionally, when teachers create assessment items, they too are making assumptions about students’ mathematical thinking. Overall, teachers begin to recognize and articulate that helping students develop multiple problem-solving strategies will assist them in being successful on the exam, regardless of how the state aligns the item with the objective. ",23,mtms2008-03-390a,,
"A related sorting activity involves focusing on one objective of the statemandated assessment. The goal is to differentiate items that do and do not align with a specified objective. For example, teachers may work to identify which preselected subset of items assesses objective 2 (algebraic thinking). This activity coupled with Schifter’s (1999) chapter concerning reasoning about operations create conflict for teachers. Schifter provides convincing examples that young students’ reasoning about operations (objective 1: numbers, operations, and quantitative reasoning) provides a foundation for developing algebraic thinking (objective 2), and in such instances, the two objectives overlap significantly. Discussions about these tensions broaden teachers’ views regarding algebraic reasoning and the structure  of mathematics as a web of interrelated concepts rather than mathematics as a discrete set of procedures.",24,mtms2008-03-390a,,

"A third type of sorting activity identifies an alignment of objectives for items that share an overarching notion, such as proportional reasoning. One activity uses cards 15, 17, 27, and 41 from the released 2006 Grade 8 Mathematics TAKS test (see appendix B). Teachers are asked to sort the four cards into two different piles and to provide a rationale for their choices. They are then asked to repeat the sort and decide on two other criteria. All four items involve proportional reasoning, yet they represent four different objectives (3, 4, 1, and 5, respectively). This sorting activity draws attention to the multiple concepts that may be used to answer one problem as well as the different ways that students may approach such problems. Furthermore, the activity shows proportional reasoning as a common thread running through many middle-grades mathematics topics (Aleman 2006; NCTM 2000) and that many different concepts, such as rate, similarity, and ratio, are embedded within proportional reasoning.",26,mtms2008-03-390a,,
"Finally, a fourth sorting activity  articulates distinctions between procedural and conceptual understanding and how to assess these forms of understanding. Teachers sort items according to whether a successful response indicates conceptual or procedural understanding. Again, teachers must consider multiple solution strategies as part of this sorting activity. For example, some teachers contend that the problem on card 17 might be successfully solved through routinely setting up a proportion and cross multiplying without attaching any meaning to the process (procedural knowledge). Other teachers argue that a student could easily reason that choice C is the only logical choice by making the following conclusions: (1) B is not reasonable, given the scale of the picture;  (2) A is not reasonable, because 13 is almost twice the value of 7, whereas 30 is not almost twice the value of 24; and (3) D would be eliminated because the task calls for creating ratios that compare width with length: The original ratio of 24 to 30 is not equivalent to the ratio of the reduced image 7 to 10. Such reasoning focuses on a conceptual understanding of ratios and scale. Still others argue that no conclusions can be made without knowing what the student was thinking when selecting an answer. The discussions surrounding these sorts provide insight into how to vary instructional strategies so that students learn ",27,mtms2008-03-390a,,
Card-sorting activities capitalize on classification multiple approaches based on conceptual and procedural understanding. Discussions evolve into what evidence provides insight into students’ conceptual and procedural understandings. ,28,mtms2008-03-390a,,
"In each sorting activity described  here, the teacher must analyze the mathematical content of the item, consider solution strategies, and reflect on student understanding and on the specific state expectations to which an item is aligned. Other activities with teachers may include sorting items based on students’ anticipated errors. For example, with multiple-choice items, teachers can be asked to identify one very strong distracting choice or choices that are equally distracting. Worthwhile discussions about student thinking emerge as teachers address why a student may choose one response over another. For example, card 17’s choice A suggests that the student was reasoning additively rather than multiplicatively. When an analysis of these choices is  then compared with actual assessment data, teachers have information about future instructional practices. ",29,mtms2008-03-390a,,
"It is worthwhile to consider replicating the card-sorting activities to determine how students approach collections of problems and how they discern mathematically appropriate approaches. For example, a teacher might ask students to sort items according to whether or not creating a table of values would be an appropriate strategy or whether or not the calculator would be an appropriate tool for determining a solution. Or depending on what a teacher wants to know about his or her students, he or she could ask students to sort items according to strategy, and allow the student to define the strategy. In either case, such activities help students and teachers focus on mathematical processes rather than correct answers while helping students become more familiar with the state-mandated items. ",30,mtms2008-03-390a,,
"Card-sorting activities that involve  state-mandated test items and objectives provide fruitful opportunities to help teachers familiarize themselves with state mandates while thinking deeply about good mathematics instruction and assessment. In so doing, teachers can investigate student thinking and students can focus on mathematical processes. In all cases, the sorting process provides an opportunity to more fully understand the contexts that create the data by which one’s school district are held accountable.",31,mtms2008-03-390a,,
