"Toward a Definition of Reflection “As students progress through the grades, the mathematics about which they communicate should become more complex and abstract. Students’ repertoire of tools and ways of communicating, as well as the mathematical reasoning that supports their communication, should become increasingly sophisticated. Support for students is vital” (NCTM 2000, p. 60). Students often make comments that indicate partial understandings and misconceptions. With these comments in mind, a teacher can ask questions that scaffold the students’ understanding. This article addresses the partial understandings and misconceptions that arise from using everyday language to describe the geometric concept of reflection. ",2,mtms2009-03-396a,,

"Because if this part is shaded right here, I think this part should be shaded. Would that be the mirror image? Since these were opposite, and what was on the bottom before, it seemed like they should be on the top now.",11,mtms2009-03-396a,,

"Because I had to try it like I was looking into a mirror. Because whenever you look into a mirror, it’s always the opposite. Like my right eye would actually be in the mirror on the left. And when you look at words in a mirror, it’s always backward.",13,mtms2009-03-396a,,
" In both these cases, the line of  reflection was viewed as being a mirror, and the students were mentally walking to the other side and looking back across the line. However, their misunderstanding of a reflection led them to create a rotated image rather than a reflected image. Their responses indicated that they had not thoroughly developed their understanding of the term “mirror image.”  “The understanding of mathematical terminology has to come from inside mathematics, not from the everyday language we use to talk about it” (Smith 2002, p. 35). To make the transition between the everyday use of the word mirror and its mathematical use, students might benefit from a discussion of mirrors through questions such as these: 1.  Look into a mirror and raise your right hand. Which hand does the person in the mirror raise?  2.  Why does a mirror reverse left  and right? Does it reverse top  and bottom? 3.  What happens when you hold two  mirrors at a right angle and look into them? ",14,mtms2009-03-396a,,

"To demonstrate that a mirror  reverses left and right, consider the task in figure 3. The original figure is labeled counterclockwise. What happens to the labeling of the hexagon in the reflected image? Because the labeling of the reflection is clockwise while the original figure is counterclockwise, students can see that a reflection reverses orientation. ",18,mtms2009-03-396a,,
"A common notion held by students is that a reflection flips a figure across a given line. Students in my research study who used this description in their explanations accurately  shaded the reflected image. They talked about the line of reflection acting as the “fold line.” The fold line was created, either physically or mentally, by laying one part of the paper over the other and creasing the paper on the line of reflection. Should this notion be preferred, or is it possible that using the idea of a flip could also cause misunderstanding? ",19,mtms2009-03-396a,,
"To demonstrate why the description of a reflection as a flip may cause trouble, consider the shape in figure 4. Students may need to use a model constructed from multilink cubes. Their task is to build a reflected image. Students may benefit from discussing these questions:  1.  Does a flip of the model give the  reflected three-dimensional image?  2.  Hold the model in front of a mir- ror. What do you see? 3.  What relationships do you see  between the object and its reflected image?",20,mtms2009-03-396a,,

"The everyday usage of the terms mirror and flip are sometimes helpful when describing a reflection. But neither term suffices alone. Students should pause when looking at a figure and its reflected image and should discuss what aspects of both ideas are invariant. For example, when using a mirror or Mira, students should observe that distance from the mirror line for both the original figure and its image is invariant. The closer the figure is to this line, the closer the image is. This invariance of distance is also true when thinking about a flip across a line. Another invariant aspect of a figure and its image using either mirror or flip is that the line segment connecting each image point to its original point is perpendicular to the reflection line. Both of these invariants are demonstrated in figure 5. If students take time to consider the relationship between the original figure and its image, they can begin to phrase a mathematical definition of reflection based on the invariants: •  A line segment connecting a point  on the figure and its image point under the reflection is perpendicular to the reflection line.",22,mtms2009-03-396a,,

"Two points A and A ′ are reflection images of each other over a line of reflection if line segment AA ′ is perpendicular to the line of reflection and is bisected by the line of reflection. If all the points in one figure are reflection images of all the points in another figure, the figures are reflection images. The images are congruent, but their orientation is reversed. (p. 197) conclusion",25,mtms2009-03-396a,,
"This article discusses two misconceptions related to using the everyday language of mirror image and flipped image to describe the geometric concept of reflection. Developing the ideas of invariant relationships between the figure and its image is the key to dispelling these misconceptions. Activities should encourage students to see that a line segment, connecting a point on the figure with its corresponding point on the image, meets the line of reflection at a 90 degree angle and is bisected by the line of reflection. These activities will give the students a deeper understanding of the concept of reflection. ",26,mtms2009-03-396a,,
