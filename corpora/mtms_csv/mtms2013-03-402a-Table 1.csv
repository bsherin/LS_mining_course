"My sixth-grade prealgebra students loved the humor in these pi investigations. They found it ridiculous to recite pi backward since “it has no end, and you can’t have a beginning.” The personalities of the various numbers caused a lot of oohs and ahs, quickly followed by students adding their own suggestions:  –(–3): doesn’t know if it’s coming or going; 6: a perfectionist (a perfect number); 1 3/5: all mixed up; 2: a prime leader; 0: nowhere to go; and 2/5: too many fi ts.

"The final question was the most interesting. After reading the problem and discussing it within groups, students voted for the best value. Only 5 percent voted for the 14-inch pizza; 94 percent stated that the deals were equivalent. Most students justified their reasoning by examining the price and stating that it was double. Once the area was drawn and calculated, they realized that squaring the radius provided a greater amount of pizza in the 14-inch size. ",41,mtms2013-03-402a,,

"My eighth-grade algebra classes had recently completed the usual activities on classifying numbers. They had been through a Venn diagram notetaking lesson, had filled out checklists, and had ordered the numbers.

"As a review for the upcoming test,  we began class with this FoxTrot cartoon. Jason and his siblings in the cartoon are regular visitors in our math class. The laughter immediately started, and students were using the proper vocabulary with no reminders from me. The class discussed the humor in the cartoon and the answer to the first question. They worked with a partner through the next three questions with little difficulty. Some students felt that because 22/7 is a ratio, it should be counted as a “precise description.” We reviewed how to convert fractions to decimals and discovered the six-digit repeat. A few also had difficulty identifying  the number with the “radical disposition.” Early in the school year, most students do not realize that the radical is not officially called the square root symbol. Given the nature of the third question, some guessed the answer to the fourth question without working through it.",46,mtms2013-03-402a,,

"My sixth-grade students were familiar with π but were generally interested in how a number that continues to grow in smaller and smaller increments (increasing at a decreasing rate) never ends. Using an 8 1/2 in. × 11 in. piece of paper to demonstrate, I asked them to consider moving from one edge  of the paper to the opposite edge (8 1/2 in. away) by moving half the remaining distance each move. Their  otheR ideas goal was to determine how many moves it would take to get to the opposite edge. Students learned that like the irrational number p, adding these smaller and smaller increments as you travel across the paper represents an infinite number of sums (smaller and smaller parts are being added endlessly).",50,mtms2013-03-402a,,
"I let my students know that they stumbled onto something known as an infinite series. They reasoned that if you move 1/2 the distance + 1/2 the distance remaining (1/4 of the total), + 1/2 the distance remaining (1/8) + 1/2 the distance remaining (1/16), and so on, the sum should be one whole, or 1. But they argued they would never get a sum quite equal to 1. From this, we discussed the concept of infinity and that this process of repeated sums would continue indefinitely.",51,mtms2013-03-402a,,
This Cartoon Corner certainly challenged me to seek clearer ways to investigate the concept of infinity (and limits) with my students.,52,mtms2013-03-402a,,
