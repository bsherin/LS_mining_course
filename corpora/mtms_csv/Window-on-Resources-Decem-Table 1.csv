4,Window on Resources December 2013 / January 2014,Wallace and Evans have written a book full of practical ideas that teachers can use to build mathematical literacy in their  students. The authors intend for this book to be a part of university education departments that train future teachers in middle school and high school. It is also intended to be used for teacher in-service training to improve classroom instruction and as a resource for middle and high school media centers. ,4,Window on Resources December 2013 / January 2014
5,Window on Resources December 2013 / January 2014,"The book is divided into three sections. Section 1 explores mathematics in our language and the pedagogy of mathematics and literacy.

Hands-on classroom activities and projects are also included. One project that will generate high student interest involves tracking social media responses over time, graphing their responses, and comparing them with appropriate geometric functions.

14,Window on Resources December 2013 / January 2014,"This book provides an overview of RtI, including definitions, vignettes, and descriptions of each RtI tier. Each chapter includes materials for teacher groups who are beginning RtI implementation in professional learning communities. The final chapter provides an overview of a lesson study. The focus is on schoolwide implementation of RtI from the viewpoint of teachers. ",14,Window on Resources December 2013 / January 2014
15,Window on Resources December 2013 / January 2014,"This book may be appropriate  for groups of teachers in K-grade 8 schools who are working collaboratively. It seems less appropriate for individuals, although some of the vignettes, definitions, and tools may provide information about classroom organization and recordkeeping. A strength of this book lies in its descriptions of team-based approaches to problem-solving about children’s learning and calls for teachers’ collaborative inquiry into their practice. The book exhibits high expectations for learning for all students. Unfortunately, all these are couched in the assumptions espoused by the paradigm of datadriven, testing-intensive models of schooling, which is controversial. The authors recommend collecting test data often and assume that teachers will spend hours per week on collaboration and recordkeeping. Many of the tools provided are extremely complex. Parts of the book are quite dense with ideas that are briefly explained; some very important ideas that could have a big  impact on implementation may get lost in the mix.",15,Window on Resources December 2013 / January 2014

22,Window on Resources December 2013 / January 2014,Whole Class Mathematics Discussions opens with an overview that offers a compelling case for using such discussions  in mathematics lessons. Subsequent chapters outline different aspects of whole-class discussions: organizing the physical space; establishing classroom routines; planning the lessons; asking questions and making connections; and reﬂ ecting on the discussions. Teachers who are interested in improving classroom discussions could ﬁ nd this book useful as part of a study group.,22,Window on Resources December 2013 / January 2014

Furthermore, mathematical errors in the book could be detrimental to someone who is unfamiliar with the content. For these reasons, I recommend that this text be read in a study group led by someone who is knowledgeable in mathematics content and pedagogy.",24,Window on Resources December 2013 / January 2014
