"T he students were a bit skeptical when they saw fifty toys distributed throughout  their classroom that day. Their curiosity was piqued, and they wondered, “Is this a trick? This doesn’t look like math!” We soon learned that seventh graders are not averse to playing with toys. It was a bit more startling to find that once they got a ruler in their hands, they enjoyed learning math and developing their understanding of scale factor. Toys in the classroom was the result of a National Science Foundation grant that brought two engineering graduate students to a middle school math class. The graduate students and teachers collaborated in an effort to enhance students’ mathematical learning. An engineering context was theorized as a way to further develop students’ understanding of mathematical ideas (Hiebert 2003; NCTM 2000).",5,mtms2010-03-386a,,
"Seventh-grade students were learning about scale in a unit called Shrinking and Stretching (Lappan et al. 2006). To introduce the Scale Model Project, students explored the concept of calculating scale factors commonly used for toys. Dollhouse pieces and toy cars were just some of the toys that were brought into the classroom and measured. Students used their measurements of the toys with an estimate of the full-sized objects to define a ratio from which they could calculate the scale factor. Class discussion revealed that toy manufacturers used different scale factors to make toys.  about Our School our school is in a community  in which 90 percent of the  students receive free or reduced lunch and 20 percent meet the proficiency standard on the mandated state math test. in the class, 21 percent were members of migrant families, and 40 percent were enrolled in an eSL program.

This football stadium scene contains 10 yard lines (though not drawn to scale) as well as a sideline camera that is recording the catch in the end zone. ,7,mtms2010-03-386a,,
"The graduate students clarified  that a scale factor is really a ratio that describes the relationship between the measurement of the full-sized object and the smaller model. Eventually, the students created the term little-to-big. Discussion ensued in which a scale factor of 1 to 8 was used to describe the relationship of a full-sized object being 8 times the size of the model. They developed the equation  b = sm, with b representing the measurement of the bigger full-sized object, s the scale factor, and m the measurement of the model. Students recognized that the scale factor was a ratio of the two measurements by the equation  s = b/m. The Scale Model Project took the toy exercise one step further by letting students use scale factors to build miniatures of their own.",8,mtms2010-03-386a,,
"Engineers build scale models  during the process of designing new buildings, vehicles, or other physical objects. The design process involves selecting and sizing parts while using a scale factor to compute the relative sizes of components in their model.",9,mtms2010-03-386a,,
"Over the next two days, students  worked in teams to build scale models of scenes that were familiar to them. ",10,mtms2010-03-386a,,
"While developing their understanding of ratios and scale factors, this project helped middle school students recognize the importance of accurate measurement and correct arithmetic. ",11,mtms2010-03-386a,,

"This project gave students an opportunity to explore scale factors and how scale is used to shrink or stretch objects. The preceding toy lesson introduced students to the different scale factors used by toy manufactures, and they represented their mathematical ideas with equations. The focus then shifted from finding a scale factor to using the scale factor to find an unknown measurement. The following lesson was a hands-on activity in which each student worked with easy to find materials to build scale models. ",13,mtms2010-03-386a,,
Herron-Thorpe: How many times  bigger is a real object than its toy model? Can you write this as an equation?,14,mtms2010-03-386a,,
Students: Multiply the model by the  scale factor.,15,mtms2010-03-386a,,
He then recorded the students’ response by writing this equation about stretching on the board: model size × scale factor = full size,16,mtms2010-03-386a,,
Herron-Thorpe: What about finding  the model size of a real object?,17,mtms2010-03-386a,,
Students: Divide the full-sized object  by the scale factor. ,18,mtms2010-03-386a,,
This statement about shrinking was written on the board: full size ÷ scale factor = model size,19,mtms2010-03-386a,,
"In this way, students described how to both stretch and shrink an object.",20,mtms2010-03-386a,,
"The Scale Model Project was  composed of two activities spread over two days. During day 1, students built scale models of themselves. During day 2, students selected a scene and worked together to build scale models of objects that would then be assembled into a cohesive diorama. ",21,mtms2010-03-386a,,
"Using the results of the toy model  lesson, we chose a scale factor of 20 in which the full-sized object was 20 times the model. The scale factor of 20 is frequently used by engineers to create models of proposed structures and was a reasonable number for the project. Students realized that by using one scale factor for all objects, they could construct models that could then have interchangeable components. ",22,mtms2010-03-386a,,

"To build scale models of themselves, students measured their heights as well as the lengths of their arms, legs, and torsos. They calculated the measurements for their model using the scale factor of 20 and recorded the results in a table (see fig. 1). Students used mathematical reasoning to estimate the computed fractional equivalence to benchmarks with increments of 1/8 inch. Throughout this process, students found a more efficient strategy, referred to as a shortcut, which simplified computation. ",24,mtms2010-03-386a,,
"For example, Maria’s arm was   24 inches long, which was converted to 1  4/20 inches for her model. She first found an equivalent fraction for  4/20, which is 1/5. One-fifth was not on her ruler, so she needed to approximate it to an eighth or a sixteenth. To begin, she converted 4/20 to 8/40, then wrote equivalent fractions for 1/8, 2/8, and so on. She decided that 8/40 was closer to 10/40 (or 2/8 = 1/4) than 5/40 (or 1/8). Thus, she made a scaled arm that was 1 1/4 inches long. The estimated lengths were reviewed by the teachers and graduate students to ensure that the student measured accurately and used mathematical reasoning to make an appropriate representation of themselves using the scale factor. ",25,mtms2010-03-386a,,
"As Maria used her ruler and  compared fractions with it, she found an efficient strategy that eliminated finding equivalent fractions. When finding the length of her torso, she noticed that 1/16 was half of 1/8. Maria explained, ",26,mtms2010-03-386a,,
"This is really easy. All you do is see if the fraction is bigger or less than the halfway spot [1/16]. When the denominator is bigger, the fraction is smaller. So the fraction [1/10] is between the halfway spot and 1/8. If it were less, then I’d make the torso 1 inch. Since it isn’t, the torso has to be 1 1/8.",27,mtms2010-03-386a,,
Maria then explained how she found a number to represent the halfway spot:,28,mtms2010-03-386a,,
"See, if you take a pie and cut it into 8 pieces, each piece is 1/8. Now cut each in half and you have 16. So half [of 1/8] is a sixteenth.",29,mtms2010-03-386a,,
"We conclude that Maria demonstrated a heightened awareness of relationships between fractions when she articulated a strategy for finding a halfway point between two fractions and then used it to determine whether 1/10 was closer to 1/16 or 1/8. Other students also demonstrated a deeper understanding of fractions as they translated full-scale measurement to a  scale model measurement and estimated an appropriate length using a ruler. To create their scaled-down selves,  students used flexible straws to represent arms and legs; a toothpick for the neck; aluminum foil for the head; and floral foam for the body, hands, and feet. Plastic knives were used to cut the foam, scissors were used to cut straws, and toothpicks were simply snapped in half. After cutting pieces to the appropriate sizes, which were checked for accuracy within 1/8 inch, students were able to quickly construct a scale model person. ",30,mtms2010-03-386a,,
"Straws and toothpicks stick into  the foam body very easily, but the aluminum foil needed to be “balled” around the toothpick so that it would not fall off. We decided against using glue to minimize the mess and the time needed for the activity. As a result, every student had a scale model self after only forty-five minutes.",31,mtms2010-03-386a,,
"Before class was over, students were  given the opportunity to suggest a scene that they would like to construct in the next part of the project. Suggestions included a beach, a park, a football stadium, a restaurant, a haunted house, and several others. The next  day, students worked in small groups or individually to compute the sizes of their models and build components of the scene. After everyone finished creating their scale model objects, objects were assembled onto one foam board to create the final dioramas. ",32,mtms2010-03-386a,,
SCeniC MaTh,33,mtms2010-03-386a,,
"Building the components of the student-selected scenes presented new challenges. Because of the school district’s pacing plan, students needed to complete their scene in one class  period. This time constriction prevented students from making wellfurnished buildings. Students faced another constraint when they wanted to build ambiguously constructed objects. For example, one group expressed interest in making a haunted house, but as one student began to work on a ghost, they realized that although it is easy to draw, it is difficult to build. ",34,mtms2010-03-386a,,
"Overall, it was important for  students to be able to envision how objects could be constructed, given the available materials. Since students used the same sort of materials as engineers when they construct ",35,mtms2010-03-386a,,

"models, it was a good experience for them to work with “material science.” If clay or Play-Doh© were used, which students requested, ambiguous objects could be sculpted, which would have minimized the use of engineering principles and changed the project to one of artistic expression.  engineering Their OBJeCTS",37,mtms2010-03-386a,,
"Working with material such as floral foam, which could be cut to virtually any shape, allowed students to think of possibilities without limitations. The preformed toothpicks, straws, and aluminum foil gave them structure. A foam cutter, which is similar to a cheese cutter, easily cut the floral foam bricks into manageable pieces. Foam was an effective structural material. Because of its low density, pieces could be supported easily and other pieces could easily connect with the toothpicks and straws. String was also used when constructing swing sets and other items. Although cardboard was ineffective for constructing large objects because of the gluing required, students covered small pieces of cardboard with aluminum foil to make a playground slide, signs, and the top of a merry-go-round, among other objects. Students also successfully created many objects for their scenes using foam slabs, among them a bicycle, basketball courts, trees, benches, and animals.",38,mtms2010-03-386a,,
"Overall, students enjoyed the  creative freedom, but they occasionally struggled with building certain objects. Many students needed a moderate level of coaching to identify which materials to use for different parts of their model. It would have been helpful to give sets of instructions describing how to make simple objects with the materials. For example, students would have benefited from recommended steps outlining how to create a simple tree or a table. Samples of finished models helped students see,  for example, that straws make good legs, whereas foam works well for large, bulky items. Furthermore, since students used toothpicks to combine various pieces, instead of sculpting the foam, it forced them to repeat their mathematical calculations for accuracy and correct shrinkage. They were encouraged to continually think about the process of benchmarking their measurements.  reFleCTiOnS Was this project successful? What would have made it more successful? Reflections from teachers and their students revealed meaningful information. Having students create a scale model self was a great way to engage them in envisioning a scene. They were excited to start measuring and “shrinking” so that the scale model scenes could be created.",39,mtms2010-03-386a,,
"Time was an issue for some stu- dents. By the end of class, some students needed more time to finish what they started, largely because of a culture of not doing homework. They did not complete their scale model calculations before class partly because of their incomplete understanding of long division. Calculators could have been used, but the teacher wanted students to practice long division because they “needed to see why basic skills are important.” Thus, the time available for working with the materials was limited. ",40,mtms2010-03-386a,,
"The project was successful from  the teacher’s perspective, as shown by her comment: ",41,mtms2010-03-386a,,
I was pleased that the students could actually put the scale factor into use. I was also pleased that several months later they still remember what scale factor is and how to find it! The fact that they understand fractions better is an unexpected bonus.,42,mtms2010-03-386a,,
"Before the annual state-mandated  math test, students were given a  cumulative review. They  vividly recalled what they had learned during the Scale Model Project. One student reflected, “The thing I liked the best was when it was finally done, because we made something 100 yards smaller, with tiny camera men, bleachers, football players, and a score board.”",43,mtms2010-03-386a,,
"Most students  recalled how to make a copy of something using a scale factor; in the past, they would have had difficulty solving any scale factor problem. After reflecting on the project, students suggested, “We should get a chance to make things bigger! Like two times us.” The Shrinking and Stretching Unit was three weeks, and the Scale Model Project lasted only three days.",44,mtms2010-03-386a,,
"The project intertwined students’ understanding of scaling, benchmarking fractions, and measuring, which increased the retention of their learning. Many students commented that “the project was fun and interesting.” It was encouraging that several students expressed concern that the scale model scenes had been damaged from students playing with the delicate materials. From their comment, “We needed stronger toothpicks!” they recognized the necessity of engineering durable materials. ",45,mtms2010-03-386a,,
"The graduate students who developed this project were supported by a GK-12 National Science Foundation (NSF) grant that brought mathematics and engineering graduate students into public schools. As part of the grant, Herron-Thorpe was enrolled in a course on culturally relevant pedagogy (Ladson-Billings 1995). The course emphasized the importance of connecting mathematical ideas with experiences that relate to students’ lives. After completing the project, he reflected,  more ownership of their learning. Of equal importance was allowing students the opportunity to create something together. They became genuinely interested and concerned with successfully participating in the activity.

"Clearly, the Scale Model Project not only led to retention of the mathematics involved, but also gave students a way to think about the design process, which is directly related to the goal of the grant to develop mathematical thinking through engineering applications. This project helped students connect their own lives to mathematical ideas while integrating engineering concepts. Thankfully, the teachers felt that their goal of reinforcing mathematical concepts was also met. ",48,mtms2010-03-386a,,
COnClUDing reMarkS Students deepened their understanding of equivalent fractions and using benchmarks to make approximations. They explored the notion that all measurements are approximations and that the degree of accuracy is determined by the situation or a desired outcome. This notion is critical in engineering applications and is often difficult for students to conceptualize. The Scale Model Project helped students understand how to use scale factors and showed them that engineering can be used creatively.,49,mtms2010-03-386a,,
"We found that as culturally relevant  pedagogy suggests (Ladson-Billings 1995), having students engaged in a project that required them to “do” math activated deeper retention and ",50,mtms2010-03-386a,,
"It is very easy for students to become disengaged from activities that result in a completed worksheet. However, engaging them in an activity in which an end product is displayed combines both individual interest and classroom collaboration. Building scale model representations of themselves and other objects in their lives gave every student ownership of their work and encouraged creativity in correlation with mathematics. ",51,mtms2010-03-386a,,
"Every member of the class appreciated the fact that we had an end product that could be shared with others. Later on, it would represent a physical mnemonic device, allowing students to recall their understanding of mathematically shrinking and stretching objects and measurement concepts. In addition, students enjoyed displaying their completed scale model scenes in the classroom because they became pieces of their lives. ",52,mtms2010-03-386a,,
"It was rewarding to see that this  activity, although a lot of fun, inspired nearly all students to become concerned with whether the mathematical process was being done correctly. This process, we hope, will lead to significant retention of the overall scaling principle.  reFerenCeS Hiebert, James. “What Research Says about the NCTM Standards.” In A Research Companion to Principles and Standards for School Mathematics,  edited by Jeremy Kilpatrick, W.
