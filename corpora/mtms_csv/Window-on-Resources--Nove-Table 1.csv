Challenges stem from naïve notions of mathematics education or limited views of “what it means to know and do mathematics and how it is learned” (pp. 34, 50). Moreover, the discussions of such challenges emphasize the need for high expectations (with respect to mathematics teaching and learning) across all grades and student populations, including special education and English language learners (ELLs).
