"Name ______________________________ 3. Our base-ten number system probably evolved because we have ten fi ngers and early number systems relied heavily on fi nger counting. If we had only six fi ngers, we might now be using a base-six system (as in the cartoon) and six symbols: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 0. For example, 35base 6 means (3 × 6) + (5 × 1). Hence, 35base 6 = 23base 10.",2,mtms2011-02-318a,,
"Expand these base-six numbers and fi nd their base-ten equivalents:   a. 53base 6 =   b. 11base 6 =  c. 40base 6 = 4. When you count your fi ngers in  base ten, you write 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. To count in base six, you write 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. You read the last fi ve numbers as “one zero,” “one one,” “one two,” and so on. Continue counting in base six until you  have also counted all your toes. Write and say the numbers that follow as 14base 6 (“one four”)base 6. See the table below.",3,mtms2011-02-318a,,

When we read a number, we  probably do not think about the base that it is in, because the value depends on the symbols used (such as 0, 1, 2, . . . , 9) and their placement. For 378, the 8 represents 8 units, or 8 ones. What do the 3 and 7 represent? 2.  Our number system, called base  ten, uses 9 symbols and a 0 to represent quantities and groups items in tens. The number 10 represents one group of 10 and no units, 100 represents ten 10s (or one hundred) and no units, and so on. The number 378 means (3 × 100) + (7 × 10) + (8 × 1).
