"Figure 1 shows 35 solutions found by students. Many examples of student work contained only a single solution, but others contained as many as 329. It is interesting to look at the strategies that students used to find a single solution versus their thinking as they  worked toward multiple solutions. ",16,mtms2011-09-70a,,
"Students who found only a single solution attacked the problem in one of two ways. They began by either  using a random guess-and-check strategy or starting with a single fact they knew to help reduce the number of possibilities to consider (see fig. 2). For example, Jeremy placed the number 9 in the lower right-hand corner because he knew that he could  form a prime number or a composite number with a 9 in the units position. He then built a prime number in the last column using an even number and the 5, since he knew that even numbers or a 5 would be composite. He found that 859 was a prime and would result in composite numbers in the first two rows. He then used guess and check to complete his solution.

"5 in the upper right-hand corner and the 2 below it to guarantee that both numbers in the first two rows would be composite. She then used the rest of the even numbers to complete the top two rows, leaving the odd numbers for the bottom row. Hannah decided first to create a list of threedigit primes, then narrow that list by removing the numbers with repeating digits, which resulted in fewer numbers to try in the columns. ",26,mtms2011-09-70a,,
"Although students who found  multiple solutions often began working in a manner similar to those who found a single solution, they did not stop after finding one solution. For example, Nicole used a process that was similar to Hannah’s but went one step further, also removing any threedigit primes that contained a zero. ",27,mtms2011-09-70a,,
"She then used guess and check to produce six solutions that worked before she stopped (see fig. 3). Others used a more systematic approach and looked for additional patterns to help them reduce the time needed for guessing and checking or to address the second portion of the task, which asked how many solutions they could find. ",28,mtms2011-09-70a,,
"Several students noticed that they  could use one solution and switch the placements of the digits within a number to find additional solutions. For example, Daniel found that he could interchange the hundreds and tens digits in 283 or the hundreds and units digits in 769 and get a prime number both times. Since these numbers were in the first and second columns, these switches did not affect the first two rows being composite; ",29,mtms2011-09-70a,,

Yash used a similar process of switching tens and hundreds digits in the numbers. He found that this method would work most of the time but not always, which led him to ask another question: “Which prime numbers can you use to flip the tens and hundreds place and still get another prime number?” He then investigated that question but could not find a pattern he could use. ",33,mtms2011-09-70a,,
"Another common strategy was to use the numbers 1, 3, 7, and 9 for the digits in the bottom row. Students realized that all primes ended in one of those four digits. They then surmised that they needed to create a composite number composed of three of those four digits. Sarita created a list of all twenty-four threedigit numbers that were possible and determined which were prime and which were composite. This gave her a list of possible numbers for the bottom row (see fig. 5). She generated thirty-two solutions, and commented that she thought more were probably possible. ",34,mtms2011-09-70a,,

"Carefully look at the problem. Formulate rules based on the problem description. After realizing that this type of problem could have many solutions, I worked on coming up with a way to eliminate possibilities that wouldn’t fit an initial set of criteria (in this case, all 3 digit solutions with repeated digits, 0’s). Then I came up with a strategy for testing the possibilities (all 3-digit prime numbers that ended in 1, 3, 7, or 9 AND didn’t contain more than 2 of them). I wrote down a list of all these possibilities. For each possible bottom row, I came up with a list of possible solutions for the columns. Then I tried all of these possibilities for the columns and made sure that the rows met the criteria of being composite numbers. Then I repeated this for all bottom row numbers until I was done.",39,mtms2011-09-70a,,
