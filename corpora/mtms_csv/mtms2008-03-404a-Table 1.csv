"Portfolios in the Middle school classroom an experiment in using sStandard classroom tests tend to  showcase what students know at that point in time and do not usually reflect real-life mathematics. They are not always accurate indicators of what students understand and how they understand it. I wanted to use an assessment tool that would allow students a better opportunity to exhibit mathematical growth in understanding and attitude over time. This tool should also give students the chance to show that they could communicate in a mathematical context, exhibit problem-solving techniques, and make mathematical connections to other subject areas. From these ideas and my review of the research on assessment, I decided to use portfolios as an assessment tool in one of my eighth-grade prealgebra classes.",1,mtms2008-03-404a,,
"Portfolios are consistently included  in discussions of effective alternative assessment and have shown positive effects in the mathematics classroom (Britton and Johannes 2003; Lambdin and Walker 1994). They not only reveal what a student has learned over the course of a few months but also show the progression of that learning. In addition, studies have shown that students gain a more positive attitude about mathematics, learn more about mathematics and themselves, and earn better grades when being assessed with portfolios (Higgins and Heglie-King 1997; Rafferty and Leinenbach 1996). ",2,mtms2008-03-404a,,
"Never having used portfolios  before, I explored available resources (one example is Stenmark 1991) and read about the experiences of other teachers who used them as an alternative assessment tool (Koca and Lee 1998 is a good place to start). Although I knew what areas I wanted to emphasize, however, successful implementation and assessment of the portfolio changed my teaching practices and caused me to rethink what I value in student work.",3,mtms2008-03-404a,,
Portfolio requireMents,4,mtms2008-03-404a,,
"Five categories were identified to  be assessed through the portfolio:  (1) mathematical attitude, (2) problem solving, (3) mathematical growth, (4) mathematical writing, and  (5) mathematical connections. I did not want my students to view the portfolio as “just another grade” so it was used as a way to encourage students to focus on areas where they excelled and improved (mathematical attitude and mathematical growth). Students also included work that identified specific instances of problem solving, communication, and connections (the Process Standards I had been specifically trying to include in my classroom activities).

"The following descriptions, rationales, and requirements for each category were explained to students:  •  Mathematical attitude—what a  student thought about mathematics and his or her work in mathematics 	 Requirements: An assignment that a student struggled with but eventually completed and a student- selected assignment  	 Rationale: Pieces that showed student struggles but eventual completion represented success and accomplishment by the student. A selection of favorite assignments provided insight into what a student valued or liked (or perhaps disliked) about the mathematics that was being studied.",8,mtms2008-03-404a,,
•  Problem solving—different ways of solving problems ranging from standard textbook problems to more open-ended items 	 Requirements: Completed assignments that showed multiple problem-solving strategies fig. 1 Portfolio requirements fig. 2 Letter to parents,9,mtms2008-03-404a,,

"Dear Parents,",17,mtms2008-03-404a,,
"We have been trying something new this past semester in mathematics class. Your child has assembled a portfolio of some of his or her work. I wanted to try using portfolios in the classroom because I have heard many postive comments about them. For example, it’s an alternative method of assessment for those students who aren’t good test takers, and it gives all the students an opportunity to show how they’ve improved. Portfolios also give the students an opportunity to reflect on their learning, and in the process they learn more about themselves. I would like you to look through your child’s portfolio, answer the following questions, and sign the bottom of the page. This was a learning experience for both the students and myself this semester; I hope that you will learn something interesting about your child by looking through his or her portfolio.",18,mtms2008-03-404a,,

• Do you have any comments or suggestions for the portfolios? chapter assessments 	 Rationale: These pieces represented  student reflections on mathematical errors and eventual understanding through revisions.,20,mtms2008-03-404a,,
"•  Mathematical writing—writing about student’s thinking in mathematics as well as about mathematics itself 	 Requirements: The main piece in this  category was a mathematical autobiography. Other pieces were chosen from writing projects, problemsolving explanations, mathematics vocabulary sentences, or learning log entries focusing on the mathematics that was being studied.  	 Rationale: Writing is a skill  constantly emphasized across the curriculum in our school and my classroom. Writing also gives some students a more effective way of communicating their thinking about mathematical ideas.  •  Mathematical connections—showing that mathematics exists outside of the mathematics classroom 	 Requirements: Pieces showing mathematics being used in another subject (or outside of school). Examples of allowable pieces were articles from a newspaper or a half- to fullpage description of how students used mathematics outside of school.  	 Rationale: Students needed to  know that mathematics was useful and applicable outside of the mathematics classroom by selecting an item that incorporated mathematics and was useful to them. ",21,mtms2008-03-404a,,
"For each submitted piece, students were required to write an introductory reflection that explained the category in which the piece belonged and why it was selected. Students also included a portfolio requirement sheet (fig. 1) as a table of contents. The structural elements were influenced by Rafferty and Leinenbach (1996).",22,mtms2008-03-404a,,
The final requirement was a form  that parents signed after seeing the portfolio. A letter to the parents  (fig. 2) summarized why the portfolio was being used and asked for feedback about how informative it was in helping them understand what their child was learning in mathematics.  assessMent,23,mtms2008-03-404a,,
"I assessed two areas with the portfolio: (1) the organization of the portfolio itself and (2) my students’ learning and mathematical understanding. Since portfolio use was new to me, I was initially unsure how to design an effective way of accomplishing these two goals. Although the portfolio was given the same weight as a conventional class assessment (i.e., a test), the real focus was to gain insight into the degree of mathematical learning and success for each student.  A portfolio assessment checklist  (fig. 3) addressed content (which would provide insight into student learning) as well as organization. A significant part of compiling the portfolio was writing insightful reflections and including pieces that accurately reflected the categories. An insightful	reflection included at least four sentences explaining why a student selected the specific piece. I wanted students to avoid writing “I picked this piece because it was easy” but to expand on that idea and explain why	it was easy. The parental feedback about the portfolio included on the assessment checklist was to show students how important this piece was to the portfolio. ",24,mtms2008-03-404a,,
"Although collecting the portfolio after four weeks was my initial plan, I quickly concluded this was not realistic if I wanted to gradually implement portfolio use in my classroom while restructuring my teaching. After giving the requirements and having discussions, the portfolios were collected about seven weeks later. As suggested by Robinson (1998), students submitted one selection and reflection midway through the portfolio evaluation period for feedback to improve the quality of their written reflections. Students were given one class period to organize their portfolios before turning in the final product.  fig. 3 The portfolio assessment checklist  The portfolio contains all requirements.",25,mtms2008-03-404a,,

"After the first portfolio evaluation,  slight changes were made in the mathematical writing category. Since a mathematical autobiography had already been collected for the first portfolio assessment, I now required students to submit a piece that showcased multiple solution methods for solving a particular problem. One student’s example showed a problem solved using guess and check and a different method.  iMProVeMents in teaching and learning",31,mtms2008-03-404a,,
"Two benefits—among many— emerged from using portfolios:  •  I began to incorporate more activities requiring my students to write, problem solve, and complete projects.  •  My students and I gained insight into their thinking and learning in mathematics.",32,mtms2008-03-404a,,
"Even though writing, solving  problems, and completing projects were already a part of my classroom, using portfolios revealed that I did not incorporate enough of these activities in my everyday teaching. Many of my lessons consisted primarily of lecture, guided practice, and homework, and students had not been given an opportunity to reflect on their learning or to try realistic problems that involved problem solving and reasoning. ",33,mtms2008-03-404a,,
"In an effort to offer meaningful activities that would benefit my students’ learning of mathematics and that could be included in the portfolio, I made significant modifications in  my teaching, such as assigning more open-ended problems. For example, students were asked to compare two different video/DVD rental plans and decide which one was a better deal. Instead of assigning an occasional project, a task was created for each chapter that reinforced or extended the material, such as the following:  •  Write a story that identifies ten  different uses of rates.",34,mtms2008-03-404a,,
"•  Create stem-and-leaf plots based  on data collection of students’ height, birth date, and numbers of letters in the first name.",35,mtms2008-03-404a,,

"When I first introduced portfolios  to my students, they were less than positive about having to do extra work, specifically the different forms of writing. I asked students to keep a learning log, write a mathematics autobiography, and note introductory reflections for each portfolio piece submitted. The writing pieces helped them gain insight into what they did and did not understand about the mathematics being studied.  learning logs",37,mtms2008-03-404a,,
"Learning logs required students to describe what they did and did not understand about an assignment. I first learned about this idea at a mathematics teacher conference (Wierenga 2004), but have since discovered more  from reading Bassarear (2005). The learning logs helped me identify what problem students were having and what successes they were experiencing so as to provide more appropriate help. In one learning log, a student wrote:",38,mtms2008-03-404a,,

"This entry explained that the  student had difficulty knowing how to find the probability of landing in the white region if there was more than one white shape in the shaded region. Although not all students engaged in learning log writing as expected, the activity was beneficial. I appreciated having the opportunity to read explanations of what and how my students were learning. Learning logs provided concrete examples of my students using the Process Standards of Problem Solving, Communication, and Connections, which I had originally identified as one reason for using portfolios.",43,mtms2008-03-404a,,

The mathematics autobiography requirement appeared to be an  important assignment that ignited student thinking about mathematics. Pseudonyms are used with the actual student writing:,45,mtms2008-03-404a,,
Ashley:    The autobiography is important to be in the portfolio because it tells about what I think about math and some of my history with it. The autobiography is important to my teacher so she knows what I like and what I don’t like. She’ll also know what’s easy for me and what isn’t.,46,mtms2008-03-404a,,

"Christine was a C-average student who was happy to exhibit mathematical work that showcased neatness and organization. David struggled to pass the class. This test was an accomplishment for him, so it was encouraging to read how excited he was about it. Consistently, students chose work that meant something to them and exhibited learning relative to their scale rather than an external scale used on a standard classroom test.",53,mtms2008-03-404a,,
"I believed that students’ attitude  toward the writing assignments would improve and their reflections would be more detailed if these items were more evenly dispersed throughout the semester. The insight I gained into my students’ thinking and their learning was a direct result of the introductory pieces. When using portfolios again, I will give students class time every other week to select one item for the portfolio and write a reflection so that they have more time to write and are not writing them all at once.

"Portfolio feedBack Initially my students thought the portfolio would be a lot of work added on top of everything else we were doing. After students had completed their portfolios for the second time, I gave them a survey (fig. 4) to find out what they thought about the experience.

"Although the portfolios required class time to organize and more time to assess than a conventional test, the process was worthwhile.

Using portfolios provided me with an authentic and effective way to assess my students’ learning and my teaching.",61,mtms2008-03-404a,,
"I think that portfolios need to be submitted three to four times a year, so that students can monitor their mathematical growth and improve their portfolio construction over a school year. To get the kind of reflections that I would like to see, students need more experience with this type of writing. Having several chances to turn in portfolios would help students get this experience, receive feedback, and ensure that they stay organized and revisit older work more often.",62,mtms2008-03-404a,,
NCTM’s Assessment Principle in Principles	and	Standards	for	School	,63,mtms2008-03-404a,,
Mathematics (NCTM 2000) asserts that assessment should be beneficial for both the student and teacher. The use of portfolios helped achieve this goal by giving me insightful information about my teaching and my students. This assessment tool allowed me to grow as a teacher and provided a spark for changing the way I taught my class; my students gained insights into their own learning and understanding of mathematics. ,64,mtms2008-03-404a,,
