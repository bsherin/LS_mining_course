Although Minecraft is a game, it is very much part of many students’ lives outside of the classroom. By organizing a geometry lesson around this game, I was able to address several questions: university partnership initiative. Faculty members from Texas A & M University–Corpus Christi collaborated with a team of preservice and in-service teachers at Tom Browne Middle School in the Corpus Christi Independent School District to plan and implement lessons using the 5E (engage, explore, explain, elaborate, evaluate) lesson plan cycle (Bybee et al. 2006). The lesson was taught in an eighth-grade classroom in which students had previously had some exposure to the topic of surface area and volume. The activity addressed the eighth-grade CCSSM content standard to solve real-world and mathematical problems involving the volumes of cylinders, cones, and spheres (8.G.C.9). Students are expected to know the formulas for the volumes of cones, cylinders, and spheres and use them to solve real-world and mathematical problems. The goal of the lesson was to foster geometric thinking in students through both teacher-student communication and by providing problem-solving opportunities (Driscoll et al. 2007).

9,Minecraft Comes to Math Class,"Minecraft is an open world survival computer game that was originally created in Sweden in 2011 and later purchased by Microsoft® in 2014. It is among the most popular computer games with students of all ages because it gives players a sense of ownership and opportunities for creative exploration. The game has three unique features: (1) no clear goals,  (2) simple graphics, and (3) endless opportunities for construction (Smeaton 2012). Microsoft has capitalized on its potential as an educational tool by developing an Education Edition, released in September 2016. Microsoft provides sample mathematics and science lessons on such topics as biodiversity, fractions, deforestation, and perimeter/area on its website, http:// education.minecraft.net/.",9,Minecraft Comes to Math Class
10,Minecraft Comes to Math Class,"Other educators have explored uses of Minecraft for instructional purposes, particularly in teaching young students computer programming skills. Schifter, Cipollone, and Moffat (2013) note that games such as Minecraft allow for constructivist teaching as students have self-directed opportunities to experiment and make modifications. Using the game in this way expands on the work of Seymour Papert, developer of the programming language Logo, by allowing students to solve problems in a virtual environment that they experience as play. Minecraft, like Logo, enables students to develop spatial thinking, owner- ship, and syntonicity, as the users imagine themselves being within the game itself (Repenning et al. 2014).",10,Minecraft Comes to Math Class

18,Minecraft Comes to Math Class,"The teacher tells the class that the Minecraft character Steve recently danced his way through a major U.S. city and that she happens to have a video recording. Before the video begins, she asks students to think about what solid shapes comprise Steve’s body and what they know about those shapes. (Find the video at https://www .youtube.com/watch?v=CSYS nKkKjOo.) After showing the video, the teacher asks students to use mathematical language to share what they know about Steve’s body. Students mention the number of vertices, edges, and faces. The teacher is focused on developing geometric habits of mind in her students (Driscoll et al. 2007), one of which is reasoning with relationships. She directs the attention of the class to these relationships by asking the following questions: •  What part of Steve’s body is a cube?   What parts of Steve’s body are  rectangular prisms? •  What is the same and what is different between cubes and rectangular prisms?",18,Minecraft Comes to Math Class

29,Minecraft Comes to Math Class,"Students are placed in groups of three to accomplish this task. The nets have previously been drawn on grid paper, which allows students to make sense of the use of square units for measuring the surface area of cylinders. The teacher intentionally does not tell the students how to go about fi nding the measurements for volume and surface area. The student data sheet (see ﬁ g. 2b) has a space for formulas. The students may enter the formulas during their exploration, but it is not required. As Uhling circulates around the room, she asks probing questions whose purpose is to orient, assess, and advance student learning (Driscoll et al. 2007). Her questions include the following: •  What is the difference between  lateral and total surface area? •  How can we use this model to calculate lateral and total surface area? •  What are the two-dimensional shapes that comprise the net for a cylinder?",29,Minecraft Comes to Math Class

34,Minecraft Comes to Math Class,"The focus of this lesson is on  understanding geometric relationships rather than procedural fl uency, so the teacher allows students to use calculators for computation if they choose. Students will use different strategies for calculating the surface area. Some  students will initially begin counting squares. Although this is somewhat effective when calculating the lateral surface area (area of the rectangle), the students realize that counting squares of a circle is not going to be the most elegant way to solve the problem when including the bases for the total surface area. At least one student in each group eventually remembers that they have previously learned the formula for the area of a circle, which can be used when calculating the total surface area as well as the volume of the cylinder. Although some students immediately recognize that the two legs and two arms are congruent, others actually need time to work with the nets, calculating each cylinder separately, before drawing the conclusion that Steve has four congruent body parts. This is an important piece of learning that students need to discover at their own pace.",34,Minecraft Comes to Math Class
35,Minecraft Comes to Math Class,"After calculating the surface area  and volume, students begin constructing the three-dimensional fi gure. Frank, a student in the class, asks Uhling, “Can you help me fi gure out how to tape this circle to the side of Steve’s leg? I can’t get it to line up.” Uhling responds, “Frank, I want  you to think about why it is challenging to attach the circular base with the rectangular side. You are welcome to discuss this with your group members.” She intentionally moves on to another group, giving Frank time to explore solutions with his peers.",35,Minecraft Comes to Math Class
36,Minecraft Comes to Math Class,"Part 3 of the tasks asks the students to personalize their Steve; they are free to change the name and/or gender, and the teacher may allow students to fi nish the decorating part at home. This is a unique homework assignment because many students are intrinsically motivated to complete it so they can share their creations in class the next day. I found that by having some creative license in designing their character, students became more engaged in the mathematics of the task.

38,Minecraft Comes to Math Class,"The class comes together as a whole group to share fi ndings for the next part of the lesson. The focus now is on sharing how different groups arrived at their measurement for surface area and volume. Although some students began by counting squares to calculate surface area, others were familiar enough with formulas from previous experiences to apply that knowledge to solving this problem. The teacher will want to ask students a few essential questions that should be addressed in the whole-class discussion: •  Can you explain the formula for  the surface area of a cylinder? Where does the 2πr come from? •  What is the difference between the formulas for lateral and total surface area? Can you show me using your model what each formula measures? •  Did you experience challenges in putting together your fi gure? Can you explain why you may have experienced this? •  When did you need to use the formula for the area of a circle?",38,Minecraft Comes to Math Class

Practically speaking, this is diffi cult, both to draw and to cut.

Since π goes on and on and on, I know that it’s never going to be totally perfect when I make it.” Frank has realized that because  is irrational, when creating these nets,  he could get only close to equivalence and that some lack of precision will be present.

To create the net for Double Steve, students need four pieces of grid paper for each single piece they used to make their original three-dimensional fi gure.
