"Curriculum Focal Points for Prekindergarten through Grade 8 Mathematics:  A Quest for Coherence is that the document highlights the coherent development across the grades of important ideas and the connections among these ideas. In this month’s Focal Points article, we will take a look at one of the most important ideas in middle school mathematics: proportionality. The ability to recognize, understand, and work with ratios, rates, and proportional relationships is crucial to future success in algebra. When  cathy seeley, cseeley@mail.utexas.edu, who is with the Charles A. Dana Center at the University of Texas at Austin, was president of NCTM from 2004",2,mtms2007-10-140a,,

"students are able to describe situations involving constant rates of change and discuss how two quantities are related proportionally, they will be prepared to understand linear functions. This understanding is a critical building block to the study of topics found in secondary mathematics. ",5,mtms2007-10-140a,,
"ProPortionality across the grades Although ratios, rates, and proportions are a major focus in middle school mathematics, it is important to follow the development of these ideas throughout the pre-K–12 curriculum. In prekindergarten and kindergarten, students work with understanding one-to-one correspondence, perhaps the most basic proportional relationship. As they explore patterns and examine numbers that are even, they encounter basic proportionality through the relationship between an even number and the number of pairs it represents. ",6,mtms2007-10-140a,,
"Fundamental work with place  value can also play an important role in building a foundation for working with proportional relationships, as demonstrated by the following excerpt from Principles and Standards for School Mathematics:",7,mtms2007-10-140a,,
"In grades 3–5, multiplicative reasoning emerges and should be discussed and developed through the study of many different mathematical topics. Students’ understanding of the base-ten number system is deepened as they come to understand its multiplicative structure. That is, 484 is 4 × 100 plus 8 × 10 plus 4 × 1 as well as a collection of 484 individual objects. Multiplicative reasoning is further developed as students use a geometric model of multiplication, such as a rectangular array, and adapt this model for computing the area of shapes and the volume of solids. They also begin to reason algebraically with multiplication, looking for general patterns. For example, they explore problems such as, What is the effect of doubling one factor and halving the other in a multiplication problem? The focus on multiplicative reasoning in grades 3–5 provides foundational knowledge that can be built on as students move to an emphasis on proportional reasoning in the middle grades. (NCTM 2000, p. 144)",8,mtms2007-10-140a,,
"Within Curriculum Focal Points, some topics will progress from the background to the foreground and return to the background across the grades as  instruction prioritizes and focuses on the most important ideas at each grade level. This scenario occurs with the development of multiplication: It moves from the background within “Connections for Grade 2” to the foreground of development as a Focal Point in Grades 3 and 4, and is extended into the background within “Connections for Grades 5” and beyond as students work with ratios and rates within the context of multiplication and division. This multiplicative development is an underlying fabric of students’ understanding of proportionality.",9,mtms2007-10-140a,,
"Fractions, especially equivalent  fractions, appear in the background at Grade 2 (in the Geometry and Measurement Connections) to emerge as a Focal Point on fractions and fraction equivalence in Grade 3 and then appear in a Number and Operations Connection in Grade 4. This sets the stage for the major focus on ratios and rates in Grade 6 and a more formalized study of proportionality in Grade 7. The concept of proportional relationships shifts to higher-level applications within a focus on algebra in Grade 8 and represents an important aspect of the Grade 8 Curriculum Focal Points on Geometry, which includes reasoning about similar triangles.",10,mtms2007-10-140a,,
"Thus, Curriculum Focal Points  emphasizes the following goal stated in Principles and Standards for School Mathematics at the middle school level:",11,mtms2007-10-140a,,
"Working with proportions is a major focus proposed in these Standards for the middle grades. Students should become proficient in creating ratios to make comparisons in situations that involve pairs of numbers, as in the following problem:",12,mtms2007-10-140a,,

"MatheMatical Processes and ProPortionality As described extensively in Principles and Standards, the content of mathematics cannot be learned properly in the absence of mathematical processes. Any description of processes across grade-level outcomes at the schooldistrict or state level will likely include statements about students being able to reason and solve problems. In particular, the development of ratios, rates, and proportionality is closely linked to the mathematical processes that students use as they learn the content and apply it in increasingly complex situations.",14,mtms2007-10-140a,,
"Students’ early work with one-to-one  correspondence is often done within a problem-solving setting, as described in the Number and Operations Connection at the prekindergarten level: ",15,mtms2007-10-140a,,
"Children use meanings of numbers to create strategies for solving problems and responding to practical solutions, such as getting just enough napkins for a group, or mathematical situations, such as determining that any shape is a triangle if it has exactly thee straight sides and is closed. (p. 11)",16,mtms2007-10-140a,,
"Solving mathematical or real-world  problems of increasing sophistication and complexity should be the basis for helping students learn how to recognize and use their knowledge of ratios, rates, and proportional relationships. Notice the problem-solving focus in excerpts from the Grade 8 Curriculum Focal Points on Geometry and Measurement and the Grade 8 Connections to the Focal Points on Algebra:",17,mtms2007-10-140a,,
"Students apply this reasoning about similar triangles to solve a variety of problems, including those that ask them to find heights and distances. (p. 20) [Students] apply ideas about linear functions to solve problems involving rates, such as motion at a constant speed. (p. 20)",18,mtms2007-10-140a,,
"Focusing mathematics instruction  on a few central ideas at each grade should be accomplished with great care so as to connect clearly related ideas and to connect ideas that may not immediately appear to be related. Thus, the process of making mathematical connections is critical, which is the underlying premise of the Curriculum Focal Points. ",19,mtms2007-10-140a,,
"The development and study of ratios, rates, and proportional relationships is a particularly noteworthy example of how ideas from Number and Operations, Algebra, Geometry, Measurement, and Data Analysis and Probability can connect through their mathematical commonalities. Thus, ideas connect within a grade level and also across grade levels as students pair new learning with old knowledge. This specific example shows the purposeful design of Curriculum Focal Points to describe a well-articulated curriculum across the grades that builds from year to year. These two dimensions of mathematical connections were succinctly described in the Connections Standard for Grades 3–5 and Grades 6–8 in Principles and Standards for School Mathematics:",20,mtms2007-10-140a,,
"Connections Standard for Grades 3–5 [Teachers] should ask questions that encourage and challenge students to explain new ideas and develop new strategies based on mathematics they already know. For example, asking students to describe two ways they can estimate the cost of twelve notebooks can prompt different strategies. . . . [Two] strategies might emerge—a rounding strategy and another strategy based on proportionality, a new idea that will receive  considerable attention in later grades. (NCTM 2000, p. 202) ",21,mtms2007-10-140a,,
Connections Standard for Grades 6–8,22,mtms2007-10-140a,,
"The key mathematical ideas in the middle grades are themselves closely connected, and ideas about rational numbers, proportionality, and linear relationships will pervade much of their mathematical and everyday activity. In grades 9–12, students not only learn to expect connections but they learn to take advantage of them, using insights gained in one context to solve problems in another. (NCTM 2000, p. 64) ",23,mtms2007-10-140a,,
"The Standards for Reasoning and Proof, Communication, and Representation also elaborate how these topics should be developed. Proportional reasoning is cited frequently in Principles and Standards as an important component of students’ set of problem-solving tools. The opportunity to communicate by justifying, explaining, and discussing commonalities among ideas or solutions to increasingly sophisticated problems is essential as students build their understanding of ratios, rates, and proportional relationships. As students move from proportional relationships into algebraic functions, they not only expand their representational options with the use of variables, they continue to use representations such as tables, graphs, and equations as they analyze situations and solve problems.

"Point on Algebra reveals a rich description of mathematical content intertwined with mathematical processes, discussing the ways in which students will solve problems, connect proportionality to the development of slope, translate among representations of functions, describe how ideas like slope are reflected in various representations, and demonstrate reasoning as they analyze relationships and problems.",26,mtms2007-10-140a,,
"a note about the PrinciPles in PRINCIPLES AND STANDARDS As already noted, Curriculum Focal Points prioritizes and organizes mathematics content that is integrated with mathematical processes. NCTM’s six Principles described in Principles and Standards may appear to rest outside of this discussion, instead serving to undergird all that is done in mathematics classrooms. However, one of these Principles should be highlighted during this discussion of the development of proportionality, as presented in Curriculum Focal Points. The Technology Principle can play an important role in content development. Translating among various representations (including graphical, tabular, and symbolic) supports students’ learning about proportional relationships and bridges a range of algebraic relationships. These representations have become particularly useful and accessible with the availability of graphing technology. Students can produce graphs from tables or function rules and explore a wide range of relationships as they make generalizations about which situations are proportional and which are not. As with any instructional tool, the teacher plays a key role in using this tool to support student learning and for determining its appropriate use.  oPPortunities for reflection and Professional develoPMent",27,mtms2007-10-140a,,
"This discussion is presented to provide food for thought to stimulate teachers’ thinking and discussions among colleagues or future teachers. The intention is that teachers will see Curriculum Focal Points as a resource for organizing and prioritizing instruction. This resource is most effective in combination with other sources, especially Principles  and Standards for School Mathematics. When these two resources are used harmoniously, one can see the full picture of how teaching can be structured effectively to stimulate students’ mathematical learning year after year. ",28,mtms2007-10-140a,,
"Most important to the picture of improving instruction, however, are teachers. Curriculum Focal Points can help educators realize the vision of high-quality mathematics instruction for every student through a fresh look at professional development and a commitment to support teachers as they shift the focus of their teaching. Some guiding questions for reflection and professional development follow.",29,mtms2007-10-140a,,
"•	 How do you discuss the development of ratios, rates, and proportional relationships with colleagues at adjacent grade levels in your school?  •	 How does the emphasis shift from grade to grade with respect to developing ratios, rates, and proportional relationships? •	 What parts of related content  continue or connect across grades? •	 How can we assess how well  students understand and can use ratios, rates, and proportional relationships to solve problems in numerical or geometric situations? •	 At what point can students represent ratios, rates, and proportional relationships symbolically, and how can we facilitate this transition to symbolic representations?",30,mtms2007-10-140a,,
