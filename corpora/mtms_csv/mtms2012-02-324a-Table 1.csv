"Algebra from sStudents can use geometric representations of numbers Chips &Chopsticks && as a way to explore algebraic ideas. With the help of these representations, students can think about the relations among the numbers, express them using their own words, and represent them with letters. The activities discussed here can stimulate students to try to ﬁ nd various ways of solving a problem and appreciate the joy of ﬁ nding various solutions. The activities also allow students to think about how to ﬁ nd patterns, express the patterns in numerical forms, and generalize the patterns into algebraic forms. ",2,mtms2012-02-324a,,
"Students work with chips to represent triangular,  square, pentagonal, and hexagonal numbers (see ﬁ g. 1); use chopsticks to break polygonal numbers into components; and represent each part and the total with an algebraic expression. In so doing, they are establishing relations between different algebraic expressions. ",3,mtms2012-02-324a,,

Jeong Oak Yun (2007) and conducted with six groups in a public magnet secondary school in Korea. The students were among the top 20 percent of their grade and had a special talent for English and a preference for social studies but were not especially gifted in mathematics. ,20,mtms2012-02-324a,,
TRIANGULAR AND RECTANGULAR NUMBERS,21,mtms2012-02-324a,,
"For the ﬁ rst activity, the teacher asked students to represent the ﬁ rst few triangular numbers using an arrangements of chips (see ﬁ g. 2), then to generalize to the nth number after investigating ﬁ rst, second, and third triangular numbers. In some classes, the teacher gave students hints, such as “where is 2 in the second triangular number?” and “where is 3 in the third triangular number?” ",22,mtms2012-02-324a,,
"The teacher then asked students  to make two copies of each triangular number using two colors of chips and arrange the chips to form rectangular arrays (see ﬁ g. 3a). Students described the number of chips in each rectangular array as the product of the number of chips in each row times the number of rows and expressed the number of  chips for the second, third, and fourth triangular numbers as half the chips in the corresponding rectangular array. They generalized the pattern articulated in ﬁ gure 3b to represent the nth triangular number as n = × + n× + n× +( n× + × + n× + n( n( n( )1",23,mtms2012-02-324a,,
SQUARE NUMBERS,24,mtms2012-02-324a,,
"The next activity involved using chopsticks to demonstrate square numbers as the sum of two triangular numbers. The arrays in ﬁ gure 4a represent square numbers. The number of chips in each row is equal to the number of rows. If there are n rows, the total amount of chips will be n × n = n2. The teacher asked students to use chips to build the ﬁ rst four square numbers, then to ﬁ nd triangular numbers within the square numbers, using a chopstick to separate them (see ﬁ g. 4b). ",25,mtms2012-02-324a,,
"Students expressed each square number algebraically as the sum of two terms that represent triangular numbers. For example, letting Sn represent the nth square number: = × = = ×3 3 = × 3 3 = × = = ×4 4 = × 4 4 2 3×2 3× 3 4×3 4× 3 4×3 4× 4 5×4 5×",26,mtms2012-02-324a,,

Students watched a slide  presentation and were asked to draw imaginary chopsticks on the board where the slides were projected.

An alternative approach could be to provide handouts with polygonal ﬁ gures and chopsticks or another long thin ﬂ at manipulative, such as fettuccini, so participants could experiment breaking the higher ",34,mtms2012-02-324a,,

"Students ﬁ rst wrote the numeric  representation of second-, third-, and in some cases fourth-polygonal numbers, then wrote an algebraic representation. The students enjoyed ﬁ nding many different strategies for just one  question and even became competitive. In one class, students found eight different ways to represent pentagonal numbers. In another class, they eagerly shared their strategies even after the bell rang. Some who showed little interest at the beginning of the task became more engaged and pursued their own ideas after watching their peers present novel ideas. In some cases, students were amazed by the different strategies of their peers. ",37,mtms2012-02-324a,,
"Using tools to partition the arrays was useful in ﬁ nding patterns. Although some students were not particularly fond of the chopsticks and wanted to use tools that could be bent, such as wire, thinking about where to put the chopsticks seemed to help them concentrate on how to partition an array of chips.

PENTAGONAL NUMBERS,39,mtms2012-02-324a,,
"The arrays in ﬁ gure 5a represent pentagonal numbers and show dotted lines to emphasize how one pentagonal number is contained in the next. Each new pentagonal number is formed by adding a new layer consisting of three sides around the bottom, thereby extending the two sides that meet at the upper vertex. This upper vertex has thus a different role than the other vertices in this kind of pentagonal array.",40,mtms2012-02-324a,,
"Pentagonal numbers can be  decomposed into triangular numbers. One form of decomposition is shown in ﬁ gure 5b. Students expressed each of the pentagonal numbers as a sum of three triangular numbers.

FINAL COMMENTS,67,mtms2012-02-324a,,
"Polygonal numbers are one form of geometrical representation that can  be used to explore relations among numbers. A teacher can use geometric representations to help students as they learn to use algebra to generalize and justify (Flores 2002). As we saw above, students used explicit expressions that emphasize the relationship among the parts, such as 1 2× 1 2× ×2 3 2 3 3 4× 3 4× ×4 5 4 5 for successive triangular numbers, rather than just writing the totals 1, 3, 6, 10. Students also connected these numerical expressions to corresponding geometric representations within the pentagonal or hexagonal numbers. Using this approach as a scaffold,  students were able to generalize to algebraic expressions using variables. Polygonal numbers and other geometric representations used this way can thus provide a more concrete step toward the more abstract use of letters as variables or generalized numbers, which for beginners may be a little complicated.",68,mtms2012-02-324a,,
