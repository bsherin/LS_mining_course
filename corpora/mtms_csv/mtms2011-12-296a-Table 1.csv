"Education, 90 percent of the future jobs in the United States will require a college degree, and many of these jobs will be in the service industry (Spellings 2006). Service jobs that require people skills may be more difficult for adults with disabilities, including those with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), learning disabilities, emotional and behavioral disorders, and Asperger’s syndrome. Although many students with disabilities included in general education classrooms are high functioning intellectually, anecdotal evidence suggests that social skill deficits may prevent them from securing the well-paying positions that they may otherwise be qualified to hold (Price 2010). ",5,mtms2011-12-296a,,
"In addition to the importance of social skills for employment, current legislation is calling for all Americans to be prepared to enroll in at least one year of higher education or job training to ready our workforce for a twenty-first-century economy (U.S. Department of Education 2010). In short, teachers are being asked to make sure that students are college ready and potentially career ready when leaving K-12 schools.",6,mtms2011-12-296a,,

"College and career readiness can be defined as including all skills required to succeed in credit-bearing courses at the community-college level (Paulson 2010). College and career readiness includes not only content readiness but also soft skills, or emotional intelligence, which are also factors in students’ collegiate success. Although it is important for students at the middle school level to increase their content knowledge, it is also important for students with disabilities to become more aware of their own emotional intelligence and to work on improving associated abilities. These abilities include qualities such as selfdetermination, self-advocacy, social skills, and executive functioning. One  reason why students with disabilities struggle once they leave secondary schools is that the educational process has not prepared them adequately to become self-determined young people (Wehmeyer and Schalock 2001).  challenges FoR teacheRs",12,mtms2011-12-296a,,
"Central to the discussion of how to best prepare students with disabilities for college-level success in mathematics are two important notions. First, access and routes to understanding in higher-level mathematics in middle school settings are fundamental to success in college-level mathematics (National Mathematics Advisory Panel 2008). Second, although educators acknowledge the importance of social skills, evidence suggests that we do not offer such instruction or the time to practice the skills that we do teach. Mason, Field, and Sawilowsky (2004) found that 50 percent of teachers indicate that their students could  use more training in self-advocacy and self-determination skills; however,  only 22 percent of teachers indicate that they are prepared to teach those skills. Social skills do not prove that a student knows math content. However, skills such as making choices, selfadvocacy, organization, and collaboration can help students with disabilities gain the support they need through accommodations as well as extra help from a peer, a teacher, or others, which will help them better understand the content.",13,mtms2011-12-296a,,

Making Choices,15,mtms2011-12-296a,,
"At the university level, students are surrounded by choices: what to eat, who to live with, whether or not to join a Greek organization, what major or course of study to choose, what classes to take, where to sit in class, who to work with outside class. Many students with disabilities never experience this freedom to choose before they enter college. It is important for math teachers to allow students with disabilities to make choices within the curriculum. ",16,mtms2011-12-296a,,
"Universal Design for Learning  (UDL) guidelines encourage multiple means of student engagement. For example, students may choose how an objective can be reached by offering ideas on whether they would like to work individually or in a group. Students can choose the context for achieving the objective by picking examples to use from daily life. They can also be given the opportunity to choose which tools or supports are available to help them understand or if they wish to work free of supports. Another idea is to allow students to choose which problems to complete during any assignment as long as a total required number is met. By allowing students to make choices, the teacher has put the power and  responsibility for learning in the hands of individual students. Offering students choices can develop their selfdetermination, can give them pride in accomplishment, and can increase the degree to which they feel connected to their learning (CAST 2010). ",17,mtms2011-12-296a,,
Self-Advocacy,18,mtms2011-12-296a,,
"As students with disabilities become more self-determined, they will learn to advocate for themselves by communicating with both peers and teachers. Teachers need to put students in situations that push them to advocate for themselves and their ideas in group settings. One reinforcing skill is the “ask three before me” strategy in which students ask three classmates for makeup notes, work, and so on, before they are allowed to ask the teacher. Teachers can also require students to ask for help as opposed to offering assistance if a student appears confused. Finally, it is important that students with disabilities request the accommodations they need for an exam or assignment each and every time instead of assuming that they will receive them because they have in the past. ",19,mtms2011-12-296a,,
Organization,20,mtms2011-12-296a,,
"Math classes at the university level require the ability to manage course materials in a systematic manner and to advocate for oneself when needing help. Sternberg and Grigorenko (1997) pointed out that many schools do a good job of teaching subject matter information but consistently fall short when it comes to teaching skills that lead to academic success (p. 702). Teachers should explain and demonstrate what students are to do, provide plenty of opportunities for practice, and give feedback when teaching content (Bakunas and Holley 2004). These same tenets hold true for teaching organization. Asking students to update assignment books daily, complete teacher checks on their  notes, and make sure that necessary supplies are brought to class are a few ideas. These organizational skills should be incorporated into the syllabus as part of students’ daily grade.",21,mtms2011-12-296a,,
"The ability to work through  problems in a systematic and organized manner is part of organization. Problem-solving instruction typically includes three focal points, according to Wehmeyer and Schwartz (1997):  1.  Problem identification; 2.  Problem explication and analysis;  and  3.  Problem resolution. ",22,mtms2011-12-296a,,
Well-developed math lessons focus on the processes and organization of problem solving as well as the conceptual underpinnings of procedures. The key is giving students with disabilities systematic feedback throughout the entire process. ,23,mtms2011-12-296a,,
Collaboration,24,mtms2011-12-296a,,
"It is difficult to imagine an engineering firm or architectural studio where no collaboration occurs among colleagues. In the business world, skills such as listening and building consensus affect the bottom line (Sweeney 2011). In essence, the soft skills have become the hard skills needed for a successful career, which is reinforced in Working with Emotional Intelligence:",25,mtms2011-12-296a,,
"If you ask successful people how  they learned what they currently know, they’ll tell you: “We learned most all we know from and with  each other.” That takes social intelligence, not just cognitive ability. (Goleman 1998, p. 201)",26,mtms2011-12-296a,,
"One key of collaborative relationships is interdependence, or being mutually dependent on one another. The field of disability, specifically, recognizes interdependence as a desirable outcome because people are influenced  daily by others, from family members to strangers (Wehmeyer and Schalock 2001). In the hard reality of a standards-based curriculum, autonomy must be nurtured and students must become self-directed. Students with disabilities should also be encouraged to engage in collaborative work, which can include introducing new concepts in group settings by having students discover a concept together. Another  practical idea is to have students choose the problem or solution they want to work on and solve. They can then be allowed to work with others to check answers while the teacher circulates around the room and helps each group. In addition, allowing students with disabilities to both receive and provide peer tutoring can be invaluable because other students benefit, as well, from peer knowledge. Lessons must be designed to engage all students in collaborative work by giving them opportunities to make choices and work together.",27,mtms2011-12-296a,,

"To demonstrate how to incorporate soft skills into a specific lesson, consider the lesson titled “Every Breath You Take” from the NCTM Illuminations website (http://illuminations.nctm .org/LessonDetail.aspx?ID=L243). The lesson components include open- ended exploration, estimation, experimentation, and data exploration. Students estimate how many breaths one would take during a certain time period, explore ways to find the answer, and then display their real-life estimates. The lesson is designed to encourage students to develop a sense of and familiarity with large numbers. We examine the integration of soft skills throughout each lesson phase. ",29,mtms2011-12-296a,,
Lesson Opening,30,mtms2011-12-296a,,
"To open the lesson, teachers ask students to list examples of things they  do once, ten times, and one hundred times each day. Students make estimates, then discuss those estimates with classmates to determine the exact number. ",31,mtms2011-12-296a,,
"Large Number Estimates The next part of the lesson takes students through establishing a range of estimates using the mean, the median, and outliers. The lesson plan directs students to go through each of the activities. However, making choices can easily be infused into this lesson because students choose how they would like to use the data. ",32,mtms2011-12-296a,,
"Collaboration can also be included  in this piece of the lesson. After students have individually chosen how they want to use the data, they can collaborate with others who have made a similar choice. Students can work together to not only figure out estimates, means, and so on but also choose other tasks in their daily life that they want to estimate (e.g., how many steps they take). In addition to learning in a social environment, students can work together to solve problems, resolve conflict, agree on solutions, and present their findings. ",33,mtms2011-12-296a,,
"Finally, organizational skills can also be a part of each scenario. For instance, when figuring the range, students must organize and sort estimates from the fewest to the most. If presenting findings to the class, students must organize themselves according to tasks assigned, solved, and presented. The organization, delegation, and responsibility required by the task itself, as well as its presentation, will help prepare students for college and career readiness.",34,mtms2011-12-296a,,
Comparing Solution Strategies,35,mtms2011-12-296a,,

"Collaboration  aids social skills   and content understanding.  methods (Rittle-Johnson, Saylor, and Swygert 2007). As students compare and contrast solutions, they should exercise self-advocacy skills by expressing which methods they found most successful and why. This collaboration is important for both social skill development and better understanding of the content.",37,mtms2011-12-296a,,

"To review: One of your students with a disability, Derek, enters your class after being absent the previous day. Derek approaches three classmates to see what he needs to make up (collaboration) before confirming that he can download the notes from the class website (selfadvocacy). Derek then shows you his notebook, which is organized with his notes from the day before his absence (organization). As you open the lesson, Derek works with others to discuss how many breaths he takes in a day (collaboration). He then chooses how he wants to use the information (making choices), ensures that he is recording his thought process in his notebook as you do random notebook checks (organization), and waits for students to ask you questions (self-advocacy). Finally, Derek and his group work together to present their findings, with each group member asking for help as he or she needs it and discovering the best resolutions together (collaboration, self-advocacy, self-determination).",39,mtms2011-12-296a,,

"The NCTM Equity Principle states, “Excellence in mathematics education  requires equity—high expectations and strong support for all students” (NCTM 2000, p. 12). If math educators at the middle school level want all students to get admitted to and to succeed in college, it is important that preparation includes teaching students skills in addition to content. Although legislation requires teachers to focus on content-based assessments, it is important to weave social skills into lessons, including mathematics. Making choices, self-advocacy, organization, and collaboration can all be taught through quality mathematics lessons. ",41,mtms2011-12-296a,,
