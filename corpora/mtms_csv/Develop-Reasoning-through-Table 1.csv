5,Develop Reasoning through Pictorial Representations,"There are great benefi ts to encouraging drawing in math class. When pictorial representations are part of the solution process, both students and teachers gain insight into various areas of understanding. Talking about these representations with their peers helps strengthen students’ reasoning and understanding (Cobb, Wood, and Yackel 1993; NCTM 2000) and promotes mathematical profi ciency (NRC 2001). Providing problems that require students to use representations and discussion to develop reasoning skills can help students connect the logic of their thinking with the mathematical concepts.

7,Develop Reasoning through Pictorial Representations,"Furthermore, students’ misconceptions also begin to surface as students question and discuss their representations. Again, such actions require students to further justify their thinking and reasoning. In essence, pictorial representations can help students model, analyze, make sense of, and understand the underlying math within a problem. This is especially true when learning new or diffi cult content, as occurs with proportional relationships. ",7,Develop Reasoning through Pictorial Representations
8,Develop Reasoning through Pictorial Representations,"A class of seventh-grade and  eighth-grade students was given a proportional reasoning task, which was designed to promote pictorial representations. After solving the task on their own, the students were intentionally paired with classmates who had different solutions or used different solution processes. Students took turns justifying their thinking processes and used pictorial representations to support their arguments. As students presented their ideas and solution methods, and questioned  others’ ideas and defended their own, they began to deal with incongruities in their own thinking. The opposing positions were a source of cognitive conflict; the students were asked to agree on a correct answer and create a single pictorial representation that illustrated their shared understanding. Pairs would then present and justify their representations to the class. The teacher analyzed the joint representations both before and after the students’ discussions to examine students’ understanding. In so doing, multiple underlying misconceptions in students’ reasoning and mathematical understanding were uncovered. ",8,Develop Reasoning through Pictorial Representations

10,Develop Reasoning through Pictorial Representations,"Reasoning is fundamental across grade levels and is needed if students are to succeed in more advanced mathematics (Lannin et al. 2011). Proportional reasoning, encountered in everyday life, is also important in many aspects of mathematics. However, because students do not develop proportional reasoning skills naturally, any early reasoning they have will not go beyond basic levels of understanding unless purposeful opportunities are created. When middle level students are faced with scenarios that require proportional reasoning, they frequently ignore crucial relationships and use incorrect strategies, such as additive reasoning (Chapin and  Anderson 2003).  the PRobleM",10,Develop Reasoning through Pictorial Representations

17,Develop Reasoning through Pictorial Representations,An examination of student work  and their pictorial representations revealed students’ use of several types of fraction models as well as misconceptions in students’ thinking and reasoning. Their initial representations included three types of fraction models (Van de Walle 2004):  •	 Area •	 Measurement	 •	 Set	,17,Develop Reasoning through Pictorial Representations
18,Develop Reasoning through Pictorial Representations,"Students who drew area models often used a circular (pie) or a rectangular shape to show part-whole relationships; measurement models, comparing lengths, often occurred in the form of lines or strips; and set models often employed a set of discrete objects and their subsets.

21,Develop Reasoning through Pictorial Representations,"The use of additive reasoning is a common misconception that middle level students have when first learning to think proportionally. Additive reasoning can take various forms, including the use of a constant sum or difference (Karplus, Pulos, and Stage 1983; Misailidou and Williams 2003a). A common misconception can surface when students first attempt proportion problems. They often believe that because one set of corresponding numbers within the proportion changes by a constant amount (the difference between the numerators, for example), then the same amount would be the difference between the denominators (see fig. 2). This misconception can become evident by examining students’ pictorial representations. ",21,Develop Reasoning through Pictorial Representations
22,Develop Reasoning through Pictorial Representations,"In this class, several students’  pictorial representations indicated that they were using additive instead of multiplicative strategies. In figure 3, originating from part B of the Onion Soup problem, John used an additive strategy with a fractional set model combined with an area model.

John’s initial misunderstandings seem to stem from his view of part-whole relationships. John’s picture shows that he did not understand how to subtract fractional parts from the whole in this area model because he represented “minus 2” only in symbols and in crossing out an ill-defined portion of the area. Although a teacher might have been able to diagnose the problem from an incorrect answer, John’s current understandings and misconception became clearer from the representation and explanation. Other students also solved part B using incorrect additive reasoning, as shown by figure 4, but were different from John’s additive reasoning. These students also showed a fundamental misunderstanding of fraction subtraction but did seem to have at least a basic understanding of part-whole relationships, as demonstrated by their correct area model of circular pie pieces. However, their area model and their understanding of part-whole  relationships broke down as they tried to use the model with a subtraction problem. Andy and his partner used an additive building-up strategy when converting 1/2 cup for 8 people to  1/4 cup for 6 people (see fig. 4a). Jessica and Caitlin exhibited a similar pattern of thinking (see fig. 4b) by taking away 1 for every 2 people.

34,Develop Reasoning through Pictorial Representations,"The students misunderstood how  to subtract fractions (1/2 – 1 = 1/3 and 1/3 – 1 = 1/4). They also misunderstood how to apply the additive strategy, where the relationship within the ratio is determined by subtracting one term from another (8 – 6 = 2) and then the difference is applied to the second ratio (1/2 – 2 = 1/4). These misunderstandings revealed a failure to correctly use their initial area model  when they added parts of fractions and did not maintain the same partwhole relationship when subtracting “one.” In each situation, their pictorial representations played an important role in highlighting which aspects of the problem they understood, as well as misconceptions relating to their thinking, reasoning, and understanding of the mathematics within the problem. Essentially, the pictures helped make their thinking visible, which also made it easier for the teacher to support their learning.  coMMUnicating and ReFining thinking Pictorial representations also seemed effective in helping students refine and communicate their reasoning, understandings, or lack of understanding.

Rachel’s length model, showing where lines were drawn and subdivided, helped Samantha understand how to solve the problem because it allowed her to see the unit fraction and thus the solution path. Rachel drew the whole, or 1, cup of cream and divided it into halves. She then took her drawing of 1/2 cup, subdivided it, and showed that each bowl would have 1/16 cup (1/2 cup divided into 8 parts).

All four students seemed unsure what to do next until Eli said, “Well, 6 bowls is  halfway between 8 bowls and 4 bowls, so our answer of how much cream should be in between 3 squares and 6 squares.” Casey guessed 4 bowls, but Jarin was sure that “there is no in-between.” Finally, Julia decided that it should be 4 1/2 out of 12, although Eli was still uncertain about the solution. The pictorial representation, using an area model of equal size rectangles (the whole) to compare with equal subdivided parts, helped students view their solution strategies. At that time, these students were unaware that the ratio they described as 4.5/12, which is equivalent to 3/8, was correct.

She also showed an understanding of the magnitude of fractions through her area model  (that 3/4 is greater than 1/2). Sarah knew that 1/2 cup of cream in the original recipe must be incorporated somewhere in the problem. Students who use this type of reasoning may understand what the problem is asking for, but they do not know how to solve it (Weinberg 2002).

52,Develop Reasoning through Pictorial Representations,"Models aRe PoweRFUl leaRning tools The use of pictorial representations can support students in developing reasoning skills, building conceptual understanding, identifying and correcting misconceptions, and building proficiency. Specifically, using various types of models—area, length, and set—and discussing their usefulness in different contexts help students develop deeper mathematical understandings. Some models seemed to be more useful in promoting proportion or multiplicative reasoning as opposed to additive reasoning. For example, drawings of the object mentioned in the problem (e.g., 1 cup) or simple tally marks were not useful in promoting multiplicative thinking because students typically added or subtracted using this model. The area model, however, seemed to help students better visualize the multiplicative relationships and could potentially help students transition easily into an array model of multiplication of fractions. By visualizing a problem, illustrating their thinking, and using peer groups to engage in meaningful  discussions, students were also able to develop their mathematical practices (CCSSI 2010) and learn about the underlying and fundamental concepts of proportional relationships. All these habits of mind and skills take time and multiple experiences to properly learn and develop.
