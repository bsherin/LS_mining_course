"E–Z Arithmetic is a do-it-yourself math book. The authors take the reader through fifteen chapters of algorithmic how– tos, from place  value to the use of the four operations with whole numbers, fractions, and decimals. Percentages and measurement are also explored. ",6,mtms2012-08-61a,,

"Each chapter begins with a pretest to let the reader view his or her skills before reading the chapter. The chapter material contains an explanation of a skill or concept and practice exercises including word problems pertaining to real life. Each chapter concludes with important vocabulary sections called “Terms to Remember,” a review of concepts and skills, and a chapter test to assess understanding. Of course, as with many books of this type, the answers to all pretests, exercises, and chapter tests are found at the back. ",9,mtms2012-08-61a,,
"E–Z Arithmetic would be useful for middle school or high school students in an after-school program or for an adult math class. The book, however, teaches mostly algorithms and lacks good explanations of concepts.  —Mitch Wasserman",10,mtms2012-08-61a,,

"It’s All Connected is a collection of lessons that middle school mathematics teachers can use to teach proportional reasoning across all strands of mathematics. Each lesson is, essentially,  an activity sheet containing questions that students work through, guiding them to skill mastery. For the teacher, each lesson is structured with a clear introduction, a guiding list of teaching suggestions, further questions to engage students working at all levels, and a lesson summary.",13,mtms2012-08-61a,,
"This resource is valuable because it is well written, well organized, and convenient. Proportional reasoning is a broad topic that can be arduous to teach well, but this book, with its focus on making connections among all strands, has everything that mathematics teachers will need in one place. ",14,mtms2012-08-61a,,
"My one concern with the book is that each lesson is driven by what will ultimately come across as an activity sheet. A few lessons contain activities, such as one on rates in which students actually find their own walking rate, but these practical items are limited. My fear is that students will find this resource to be too similar to rote learning.",15,mtms2012-08-61a,,
"In the hands of the right mathematics teacher, however, this concern should not be a problem, so I firmly recommend this book to anyone looking for a supplement to help teach proportional reasoning. Each lesson is accessible, thorough, and expressed well. I have no doubt that the spine of this book will quickly become well worn by mathematics teachers.",16,mtms2012-08-61a,,

"Math Dictionary for Kids presents not only definitions but also descriptions and brightly colored illustrations for more than four  hundred terms and concepts in all areas of mathematics. It also includes a quick reference guide, which gives a step-by-step account of procedural rules for decimals, division, fractions, multiplication, and percentages. A section on “Learning with Manipulatives” would be helpful to any teacher who is unfamiliar with the use of base-ten blocks, geoboards, hundred charts, pattern blocks, and tangrams. The “Tables and Charts” section even includes a handy list of factors and multiples for numbers from one to one hundred. ",22,mtms2012-08-61a,,
"This dictionary is broken into  user-friendly sections by mathematical strands, including whole number operations, measurement, algebra, geometry, fractions and decimals, statistics and probability, and problem solving. The book was organized to reflect the topics taught in elemen- tary school and middle school  mathematics. ",23,mtms2012-08-61a,,
"Math Dictionary for Kids is a great  resource that would be appropriate for students through the sixth grade or for a teacher or parent who needs a quick refresher of basic mathematical terms. A student who is adept at math would probably find they can use this book independently, whereas students with weaknesses will likely need the guidance of a parent or teacher to help them along. Although the geometry  and whole-number sections are thorough, the fraction and problemsolving sections primarily use procedural methods rather than building conceptual understanding.",24,mtms2012-08-61a,,

"In his most recent book, the highly respected Barnabas Hughes changes his style from a historical perspective to a practical application of ideas and practices that he used while in the classroom. You Are the Teacher presents ideas for classroom organization and planning and executing lessons, as well as activities to engage students and help them learn specific mathematics. Although the title suggests that this is appropriate for grades 7 to 10, any teacher could benefit from many of the ideas presented.",30,mtms2012-08-61a,,
"The material in the first third of  the book includes methods of instruction for setting up a classroom in which the focus is on students and the teacher takes charge and knows what to do to provide strong lessons. Specific ideas and models are provided, from an easy way to create a seating chart to a form for reflecting on lessons. The remainder of the book presents activities with illustrations to help students develop an understanding of mathematics from arithmetic through geometry. The activities (Native American games of sticks and logic puzzles), which we used in our seminar for student teaching, were engaging and provided thoughtful learning experiences.",31,mtms2012-08-61a,,
"This book, which describes very  answers to palette clearly the methods used in the classroom by Hughes, is interesting to read. It is also a practical guide for improving learning and mathematical aspects of any classroom.",32,mtms2012-08-61a,,

"This set of interactive notebooks for the SMART Board™ covers an algebra 1 unit on exponents and rational expressions. It is intended for grades  6-12 students “who benefit from repetition, including struggling learners.” The activities are organized in a sequence of worked-out examples that are followed by exercises for practice. Each lesson is a notebook that can be shown on a SMART Board and requires the SMART Notebook software, whose latest version (10.8) is not compatible with Mac OS 10.7 (Lion). Examples are solved step by step on the screen, one at a time, and students are expected to repeat similar exercises by filling in the blanks.",38,mtms2012-08-61a,,
"This notebook may save some  time for teachers who use examples followed by exercises on a SMART Board, but there is really nothing interactive about this product. Rules and procedures, broken down into their most basic steps, are simply stated, without any context, justification, or application. The examples are identical to the exercises (e.g., the worked- out example is to simplify 10x2/15x4; the exercise is 5x4/35x7).",39,mtms2012-08-61a,,
"It is difficult to recommend this  product. The worksheets included in the CD (as PDFs) are probably just as useful as the interactive notebooks, since these make very modest use of the advantages that technology could have added. The software is based on a very traditional approach to algebra, based on procedural knowledge. If anything, this software may save some time that would be spent writing the same exercises on a chalkboard.",40,mtms2012-08-61a,,

This DVD is one in a series of geometry skills. It contains interactive whiteboard lessons that have each skill matched with a PDF that includes lesson summaries and practice problems and their solutions. This reviewed DVD is one of ten in the geometry lessons series.,45,mtms2012-08-61a,,
"One activity involves the area of a triangle. The definition of the shape, with the diagram, reinforces the concept of base and height and their relationship. It then identifies, step by step, the data needed and places them in the appropriate formula. Other area activities included are parallelograms, similar figures, trapezoids, rhombuskite, circle, sector of circle, regular polygons, irregular shapes, area with trigonometry, and geometric probability. A useful component was a template with the interaction tabs where the instructor could insert his or her own problems.",46,mtms2012-08-61a,,
"This would be an excellent format  to present to students who had missed a lesson or who might need more background information. The lessons are presented in whiteboard format, with pull tabs for lesson progression and self-check of processes and solutions. Lessons could be presented to a class, but may be of more benefit for individual students to use on a computer with whiteboard notebook software. It does not show the development of formulas but concentrates instead on the use of established formulas. ",47,mtms2012-08-61a,,
I recommend using this product  as supportive material. Keep in mind that one must have software for an interactive whiteboard (I used SMART Board).,48,mtms2012-08-61a,,
