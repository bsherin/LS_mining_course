Carter, with Ellen Prince and Zachary Schwartz iI want my students to see any new  mathematics—fractions, negative numbers, algebra—as logical extensions of what they already know. This article describes two students’ efforts to make sense of their conflicting interpretations of 1/2 × –6, both of which were compelling and logical to them. It describes how discussion, constructing and critiquing viable arguments, supported by choosing and using an appropriate mathematical tool (CCSSI 2010) helped them refine their understanding. It also describes a mental image that can inspire or interfere with reasoning and is neither misconception nor lack of knowledge.",2,Refining Concepts: Half Isnt Always Less
3,Refining Concepts: Half Isnt Always Less,"During the students’ discussion, I mostly just listened. What made that stance effective was the logic and intuition about operations involving negative numbers that I had helped my students build over the preceding weeks. They had learned facts, of course, but also language and models for reasoning about the material. To help students build on their own thinking, my job was to listen and to work to understand both their thinking and what interferes with it. ",3,Refining Concepts: Half Isnt Always Less

7,Refining Concepts: Half Isnt Always Less,"In addition to the logic of the fundamental properties of arithmetic, my class approached negative numbers using three models—black and red chips (Mark et al. 2014), the number line (Goldenberg et al. 2015), and receiving and returning bills and checks (Davis 1964). From some students, I heard comments like “Ms. C., can’t I just use the numbers?” If students can use whatever algorithm they have learned reliably, and the only goal at the moment is getting a correct result, then, sure. However, when the goal is to extend their understanding of arithmetic into a new numerical domain, or into algebra, then the “rules” need to  be examined, and models need to be built. Moreover, most of these advanced students were at least shaky and many had entered my class with mechanical “rules” that let them insist such things as –5 plus –2 is 7 because “two negatives make a positive.” Rules fail for students if they are so misunderstood that they are garbled or misapplied, hence, my push for logic and understanding. I generally introduce more than one model for three reasons:  1.  Different models reach different  students.  2.  Multiple models allow students to distinguish the mathematical essence from the particularities  of the models.",7,Refining Concepts: Half Isnt Always Less

I offered, “Pick a model, whichever you think might be most helpful.” Without much enthusiasm, he chose chips, and set 5 black (+ 1) ones on his desk. He paused briefly, thinking about how to take away red (–1) chips, since his collection did not contain any red chips. Gabby, his desk partner, shoved in 2 pairs of black and red chips. A black-and-red pair does not change the value. His face lit up, he took the 2 red chips away, and he proudly announced that the answer had to be 7. He had figured it out. All I contributed was “pick a model.” Another student struggling with the same problem chose a different model, scrawling a number line with 5 and a –2 roughly placed on alternate sides of 0, and then announced that the distance between them must be 7.",10,Refining Concepts: Half Isnt Always Less

19,Refining Concepts: Half Isnt Always Less,MULTIPLYING USING  NEGATIVE NUMBERS,19,Refining Concepts: Half Isnt Always Less
20,Refining Concepts: Half Isnt Always Less,"Conceptual issues continued to arise as we extended multiplication. In elementary school, students build an image—incorrect, but strong—that multiplication makes things bigger. Students see two counterexamples early—multiplication by 1 leaves numbers unchanged and multiplication by 0 results in 0—but those are often experienced as ignoble exceptions rather than constructive dissonance. Students are sometimes even taught explicitly to think “am I making the result bigger or smaller?” to decide whether a word problem calls for multiplication or division, reinforcing the notion that multiplication “makes things bigger.” Multiplying by numbers between 0 and 1 shakes things up again. The idea that multiplication by 1/2 (or other fractions) “makes things smaller” is ",20,Refining Concepts: Half Isnt Always Less
21,Refining Concepts: Half Isnt Always Less,"Fig. 3 –1/2 + –1/4 = –3/4 hard won, but the dissonance often generates another special case.

Even those who largely understand fractions (excluding negatives) and negatives (excluding fractions) can be daunted by the cognitive load of dealing simultaneously with both.",21,Refining Concepts: Half Isnt Always Less
22,Refining Concepts: Half Isnt Always Less,"The patchwork image—multiplication makes things larger, oh, except for fractions—can persist into adulthood precisely because in most “normal” circumstances (day-to-day situations), this rule of thumb saves mental effort.

23,Refining Concepts: Half Isnt Always Less,"And what does   “bigger” mean? Casual language evokes two correct but sometimes competing meanings. When comparing value, we mean strict order on the number line, the correct notion that –3 > –6. When comparing magnitude, we mean absolute value, distance from 0, the correct notion that |–3| < |–6|. In casual language, context sometimes  resolves this ambiguity;   mathematically mature understanding requires more precise  communication.",23,Refining Concepts: Half Isnt Always Less
24,Refining Concepts: Half Isnt Always Less,CONCEPT DEFINITION AND CONCEPT IMAGE,24,Refining Concepts: Half Isnt Always Less
25,Refining Concepts: Half Isnt Always Less,"The notion that multiplication by 1/2 “makes results smaller” was correct in its first context, but a simplification, not general enough for moving on. In 1981, David Tall and Shlomo Vinner gave us the terms “concept image” and “concept definition” as a way to think about the tension between simplifications of an idea and more complete understanding. ",25,Refining Concepts: Half Isnt Always Less
26,Refining Concepts: Half Isnt Always Less,"To understand what they meant  by these terms, picture an eightyear-old who knows that a triangle is a closed figure with exactly three straight sides and “no extra stuff.” Tall and Vinner call this the “concept definition”: the definition the child gives when asked. But children’s actions and language show that they also hold a prototype image that is less general than the definition. We often hear children (and adults!) refer to a triangle pointed down as “an upside-down triangle.” It is not an error. It is not to be corrected. But it is evidence of an image that includes orientation, not just shape. Children may overlook a super-pointy triangle in an unexpected orientation when searching for triangles because it does not fit their image (though it fits their definition). Their concept definition is correct, complete, and fully general; their concept image is not wrong but it is too narrow. Prototypes are  useful—easy to retrieve and often “close enough”—but we must stay aware that they are simplifications, not the whole story. ",26,Refining Concepts: Half Isnt Always Less
27,Refining Concepts: Half Isnt Always Less,"It is not quite fair to treat “halving  makes it smaller” as a narrow prototype of (1/2)x. The action of halving does “make things smaller” and, in the physical world, the action is essentially the definition. But we halve grapefruits with a knife, not by multiplying by 1/2. Although arithmetic ultimately requires more generality, early arithmetic uses  positive numbers, conforming to the physical-world image of halving. ",27,Refining Concepts: Half Isnt Always Less

29,Refining Concepts: Half Isnt Always Less,"Ellen and Zak were considering (m – 6)(m + 1/2) and chose to organize their computation using an area model (see fig. 4). This imagery for multiplication (Mark et al. 2014; Goldenberg et al. 2015) had become a familiar tool for organizing their understanding.

The curriculum then extended to the algebraic case (m – 6)(m + 1/2) involving nonphysical (negative) and nonspecified (m) “lengths” (see fig. 4). ",34,Refining Concepts: Half Isnt Always Less
35,Refining Concepts: Half Isnt Always Less,"Using the area model to generate expressions like –6m, (1/2)m, and m 2 and using both black and red chips and the number line to make sense of –6m and (1/2)m allowed Zak and Ellen to go far in evaluating and understanding (m – 6)(m + 1/2). They understood, first from chips and then again from the number line, where 6m fit among the other numbers. When m was positive, 6m was already familiar, and they understood how symmetry placed –m and –6m (see fig. 7). They also understood how the logic remained the same when m was negative (see fig. 8).",35,Refining Concepts: Half Isnt Always Less
36,Refining Concepts: Half Isnt Always Less,"The students were competent at  both mechanics and meaning; the algebra and the structure were also clear to them. Interestingly, it was the value of 1/2 × –6 that created controversy. Ellen thought –3; Zak proposed –12, arguing that halving should “make it smaller.” To be clear, they did not, at this point, experience confusion or conflict with integer multiplication nor with fraction multiplication when both numbers were positive. Only when they encountered them together was the cognitive load so great that they relied on their quick-to-mind concept images rather than take on the additional burden of logic based on their concept definitions. They had the concept definitions. However, to move beyond concept image in the more complex case required Ellen and Zak to think, work together, talk, and share models.",36,Refining Concepts: Half Isnt Always Less
37,Refining Concepts: Half Isnt Always Less,"About his initial reasoning, Zak wrote, “It’s like 6 times 1/2. A half  times 6 makes a smaller number than 6. A half times any number makes a smaller number. So if you have –6 times 1/2, it would make a smaller number than –6, which would be –12.” Zak combined old knowledge— half is smaller and halves involve equal parts—with new knowledge: Smaller numbers are farther left on the number line. Despite a flaw, this starting place is tempting: His drawing shows a distance cut into two equal parts, and –12 is less than –6. ",37,Refining Concepts: Half Isnt Always Less
38,Refining Concepts: Half Isnt Always Less,"Ellen wrote, “6 × 1/2 = 3, so  –6 × 1/2 = –3 makes sense. The negative looks the same as the positive. Also 3 + 3 = 6 and –3 + –3 = –6, so it makes sense that –6 × 1/2 = –3.” Ellen’s argument, by the way, shows why doubling a negative number is often more intuitive than halving one: one can appeal to the repeated addition model of multiplication (as in figs. 5–6), which is the first (though incomplete) way that many students understood multiplication.",38,Refining Concepts: Half Isnt Always Less
39,Refining Concepts: Half Isnt Always Less,"A teacher has choices. At times, taking charge and redirecting a student’s attention is best. For example, I might have steered Zak’s attention from value to magnitude by offering  a model like debt, using Zak’s expectation that halving should “make it  smaller”: halving a $6 debt (–6) gives a $3 debt (–3). But generally, to help students refine their thinking, you  have to go where that thinking is:  helping students follow their logic, starting with the problem they identify and using their models and contexts. Students’ energy is naturally greatest at the place where they are actively learning—skills, structures, or ideas they have recently built and conflicts they identify between their concept images and definitions. With articulate, thoughtful students who have good mental tools, I favor letting them develop their own reasoned arguments and decide which tool(s) to use. My experience is that selfdirected meaningful mathematical  discourse has the  best chance of ensuring  that students are building on their  own logic instead of “replacing” theirs with mine. Even when students choose a tool I would not have chosen, or cannot quite finish their analysis, such struggle is often productive enough to help them refine partially correct notions into more mature understanding. So, in this case, I chose to let the students work this out themselves.",39,Refining Concepts: Half Isnt Always Less

Learning to construct valid chains of reasoning and to evaluate, critique, and salvage flawed arguments (CCSSI 2010) can begin in middle school and even earlier.

54,Refining Concepts: Half Isnt Always Less,"If students need help while building a complex concept, I try to further rather than replace their logic.

55,Refining Concepts: Half Isnt Always Less,"When they have chosen a model  that does extend, re-examining familiar surrounding concepts and applying their thinking to a simpler problem helps. Doing that with peers demands attention and clarity, both of which are necessary for modifying current thinking. Once they articulate a convincing logical argument  school, “1/2 of ” was largely about sharing, halfway between having nothing and having it all. Using the number  line illustrated a subtle  but important shift in  that students could see numbers in terms of location and distance. Now, “1/2 of ”  suggests finding a number located halfway between 0 and the given number (see figs. 9 and 10). Starting with halving is useful because finding half is particularly easy. Ellen and Zak extended the distance image to other fractions (e.g., numbers located at 1/3 or 1/4 of the distance between 0 and the given number) and then integer multiples of those numbers (e.g., 2/3 of n, at twice the distance from 0 that 1/3 of n is).",55,Refining Concepts: Half Isnt Always Less

They knew that for any  positive number n, the number  (1/2)n and n (see fig. 12).
