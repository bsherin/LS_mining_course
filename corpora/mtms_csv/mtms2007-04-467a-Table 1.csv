Mathematics and Visual Arts: Exploring the Golden Ratio,3,mtms2007-04-467a,,
Geometry has two great treasures: one is the Theorem of pythagoras:   the other the division of a line into extreme and mean ratio. The first we may   compare to a measure of gold; the second we may name a precious jewel.  —Johannes Kepler (1571–1630),4,mtms2007-04-467a,,

"The  Greeks  were  The  firsT  TO  AccurATeLy define  the  curious  phenomenon  known  as  an  “extreme and mean ratio.” Although plato referred to this  mathematical  relationship  as  simply  the  “section,”  it  was  not  until  the  nineteenth  century  that this  famous  proportion  came  to  be  known  as  the golden  section. read walser’s (2001) description of this unusual ratio: ",9,mtms2007-04-467a,,
"The  Golden  section  has  turned  up,  since  antiquity,  in many aspects of geometry, architecture, music, art, and even philosophy; but it appears also in the newer domains of engineering and fractals. in this way the Golden section  is  no  isolated  phenomenon  but,  in  many  cases,  the first and, indeed, simplest example in the context of a sequence of generalizations of a common idea.

Da Vinci also used the golden section to organize his two-dimensional  compositions,  believing  that  harmonic  proportions  could  add  profound  depth  and beauty to a work of art. The Mona Lisa is claimed to be an example of the use of this design philosophy.",27,mtms2007-04-467a,,
"The celebration and use of this mathematical phenomenon dates back to ancient Greece and extends to the present day. examples of the golden section ratio can be seen throughout nature (e.g., in shells, plants, animals), art (e.g., in drawings and paintings by seurat, da Vinci, Dali, colville), and architecture (e.g., in the parthenon of phidias; in work by architect Le corbusier). it is one of the strongest and oldest ties between the disciplines of mathematics and the visual arts. it can be said that this historical and universal pervasiveness qualifies the golden ratio to be part of the mathematics education curriculum.  iN mAThemATics, A rATiO is DefiNeD As A cOmparison of two numbers. A proportion is a comparison  of  two  ratios.  One  of  the  most  famous  mathematical ratios and proportions is the golden section, or the divine proportion. it is derived from dividing a line segment into two segments, with the special property that the ratio of the shorter segment to the longer segment is the same as the ratio of the longer segment to the whole segment (see fig. 1). This division is known as “extreme and mean ratio.” This ratio  became  designated  by  the  Greek  letter  f,  or phi, to honor phidias, architect of the parthenon.",28,mtms2007-04-467a,,
"Given a line that has been divided into extreme and  mean  ratio,  one  can  set  up  the  mathematical proportion  “small  is  to  large  as  large  is  to  whole” and then solve for x using the quadratic formula (see fig.  2).  (Although  the  quadradic  formula  may  not yet  be  familiar  to  middle  school  mathematics  students, it can still be demonstrated in a cursory manner to clarify the origins of this famous ratio.) Therefore, an approximation for  f (phi) can be taken as 1.61803, to five decimal places. practically speaking, this means that any given length of line can be multiplied or divided by f (1.61803) to find an external (next largest) or an internal (next smallest) golden section  length,  respectively.  As  students  begin  to work with this ratio in constructing the golden section  and  the  related  golden  rectangle,  encourage them to carry at least five decimals in their calculations and to measure as precisely as possible. (The golden rectangle is formed with the special property that its length divided by its width equals f, or approximately 1.61803. interior “whirling squares” can be shown to fill the rectangle in a continual spiral formation that maintains its proportions.) 2 4 1 ( )(",29,mtms2007-04-467a,,

"Analysis of the proportions of the building has revealed many hidden Golden section rectangles. The ground plan consists of two reciprocal golden rectangles, and the interior chamber is in golden proportion; the main façade fits into  a  single  golden  rectangle,  and  a  comparison  of  the façade with the ground plan reveals the basic harmonic relationships we associate with golden proportion. All of these connections add a sense of order and continuity to the sequence of spaces and forms. (p. 11)  it  was  not  unusual  for  the  dimensions  of  Greek buildings and sculptures to be related proportionally to  measurements  of  human  beings.  Vitruvius  (AD 100), a roman architect, concluded after much study that  the  “height  of  a  well-proportioned  man  is  the same as the span of his outstretched arms” (frayling, frayling, and Van Der meer 1992, p. 11). To illustrate this relational system of measurement, he showed a man standing with outstretched arms and feet within a circle, the center of which is marked by his navel. fourteen centuries later, Leonardo da Vinci, familiar with  the  work  of  Vitruvius,  would  create  a  similar ",36,mtms2007-04-467a,,
