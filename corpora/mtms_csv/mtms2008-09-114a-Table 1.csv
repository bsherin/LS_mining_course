"Boon Liang Chua, boonliang.chua@nie.edu.sg, teaches mathematics education courses at the National Institute of Education in Singapore. He is interested in helping secondary school teachers inspire their students to develop an appreciation for the beauty and power of mathematics through the learning and applications of mathematics.",4,mtms2008-09-114a,,
"wWhen students learn mathematics,  they tend to understand and remember the mathematical processes that they find practical and relevant. It is not surprising then that Principles and Standards for School Mathematics (NCTM 2000) encourages teachers to help students discover the relevance of mathematics in their daily lives. To help young people realize that mathematics is alive and constantly evolving, it is important for teachers to share information with students about new developments in mathematics. However, it is often difficult to find source material that illustrates appropriate applications of mathematical concepts. In addition, finding items that are interesting and comprehensible to students is even harder. The topic of functions is a case in point. Therefore, this article describes some teaching ideas based on cryptography, a practical application of functions and their inverses that students should be able to comprehend.

"Uses and tyPes of CryPtograPhy Cryptography, the science of encrypting and deciphering messages written in code, has been practiced since ancient times to secure information. Julius Caesar employed what has become known as the “Caesar shift cipher” to encode messages when he needed to communicate with his generals. Under such a scheme, each letter is shifted in some numerical order along the alphabet. For instance, if letters are shifted by three places, A  table 1 The coding system would be encoded as D, B would be E, C would be F, and so on. ",6,mtms2008-09-114a,,
"During World War II, the Nazis  used the highly sophisticated Enigma machine to encrypt their messages when they communicated, unaware that three Polish mathematicians had not only cracked the supposedly unbreakable codes of the Enigma device but also provided the Allies with the means to gain access to their top secrets (Singh 1999). Currently, the millions of financial transactions conducted over the Internet daily have made cryptography more important than ever. Companies must make online transactions secure by installing encryption software to thwart unauthorized access to information.",7,mtms2008-09-114a,,
"Several cryptographic schemes  exist, but they can generally be classified into two broad categories: transposition and substitution (Singh 1999; Smith 1955). A transposition cipher is formed by rearranging the letters of the original message. One simple example of such a cipher is found in the novel Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets (Rowling 1998). The name of one of the book’s characters, Tom Marvolo Riddle, is actually an anagram that cleverly conceals the secret message, “I am Lord Voldemort.” A substitution cipher differs from a transposition cipher in that the letters of the original message retain the relative positions in which they appear but not their identities, because they are replaced by other values or symbols. The Caesar shift cipher is an example of a substitution  cipher. By shifting three letters, A is replaced by D, B by E, C by F, and so on; the word MATHEMATICS becomes PDWKHPDWLFV. In this article, substitution ciphers underlie the fundamental principle of the cryptography.  the CLassrooM aCtivity",8,mtms2008-09-114a,,
"This activity, conducted with inservice teachers at a workshop, was developed to help students learn about functions. To stimulate and capture students’ interest, this activity capitalizes on the popularity of the Harry Potter series by J. K. Rowling. (See the activity sheets at the end of this article.) The activity begins with the following scenario: Harry Potter is hiding in a secret location to escape from Lord Voldemort. Harry needs to send messages to his two good friends, Ron and Hermione. The messages have to be encrypted in case they are intercepted by Lord Voldemort. The three good friends use a special encryption method that they devised to communicate with one another. In this article, the original message will be referred to as the plaintext, and the encrypted message will be the ciphertext.",9,mtms2008-09-114a,,
"The encryption scheme is described in stages, along with the students’ tasks. The first task is to translate Harry’s first message “Please save me!” into code by replacing each letter and some punctuation with a number, as shown in table 1.",10,mtms2008-09-114a,,

In the second task, workshop participants were told that the lock shows a relation that maps a number n to another number, denoted by  4n + 3. Participants are then asked to write down the special name of such a relation. Almost all gave the accepted answer of “a function,” but the more precise and preferred response was “a linear function,” which was given by a few participants. ",14,mtms2008-09-114a,,
"Next, the story describes the  encryption technique that Harry uses on his message “Please save me!” He replaces the letters in the plaintext  one by one by substituting them into the lock to yield the ciphertext (see  table 2). To demonstrate how he does this, three examples using the numbers 0, 19, and 1 follow:",15,mtms2008-09-114a,,

"The blank space between the two words PLEASE and SAVE, as well as the first two letters of SAVE, which were originally given the codes 0, 19, and 1, respectively, are now coded 3, 79, and 7. At this juncture, teachers may consider introducing some basic terminology, such as domain, range, and image. For instance, workshop participants were told in the third task that the numbers 3, 79, and 7 were the respective images of 0, 19, and 1 before being instructed to derive the remaining images. The third row of table 2 shows the images constituting the entire ciphertext.",18,mtms2008-09-114a,,
"The ciphertext can be obtained in a few ways, one of which is to compute only the essential images. Another method involves using a recursive rule to list all the ciphertext beneath the corresponding codes in table 1, followed by matching each letter in the plaintext with its ciphertext. To demonstrate how this method works, use this rule. Start with 0, the first code; its ciphertext is 3. Add 4 to this result to find that the second ciphertext is 7. Add 4 again to find the next ciphertext, and so on, for all letters and symbols in table 1. If students do not see the pattern initially, their attention should be drawn to it. Teachers should also look for any students who acquire the ciphertext in this manner and ask them to explain the method to the class. This method of learning should be encouraged in the classroom, since the ability to articulate one’s idea is regarded as a benchmark of understanding (Carpenter and Lehrer 1999).",19,mtms2008-09-114a,,
"To transmit the entire ciphertext to Ron and Hermione, Harry writes the numbers in groups of threes as shown in figure 1. Subsequently, these five groups of numbers are transmitted to Ron and Hermione in the sequence shown.",20,mtms2008-09-114a,,
"At this juncture of the workshop, participants often ask what happens when the length of the ciphertext is  fig. 1 The five groups of numbers, set in ciphertext xxx 67 51 23 79 23 79  91 23 55 23 111 not divisible by 3. There are many ways of resolving this problem, one of which is to use a convenient number that is a factor of the length of the ciphertext. Another way is to fill the last group of numbers with the code representing a blank space in the ciphertext (that is, 3 in this instance). The third way, as suggested by a participant, is to keep the size of each grouping at 3 and have a shorter last group. However, such a method has a shortcoming. As correctly pointed out by another participant, the recipient might think that some codes were lost during the transmission if the last group was shorter than the others.",21,mtms2008-09-114a,,
"The rest of the story describes  how Ron and Hermione decipher the ciphertext sent by Harry. After receiving Harry’s five groups of numbers, Ron and Hermione immediately reconstruct the plaintext using a sophisticated key to unlock the decoded text. The deciphering function is, however, deliberately omitted in this activity. The workshop participants were only told that Ron and Hermione managed to unlock and unscramble the ciphertext. What is the key they use to break the codes? In addition, what is the relationship between the lock used for encryption and the key used for decryption? These questions allow students to apply their thinking skills as well as hone their problem-solving skills. During the in-service workshop, it came as no surprise that these two tasks were very straightforward for the teachers, who found the correct responses quite effortlessly.",22,mtms2008-09-114a,,

For example, with 4n + 3 = k, the n denoting the code and the k denoting the image should be treated as a process. Therefore, to find the code when given the image 7, teachers may explain the process by saying, “Seven is obtained when a number is multiplied by 4, then 3 is added. What is this number?” Students can be encouraged to describe how the certain number is found. It is hoped that they will be able to undo the process as follows: subtract 3 from 7, then divide the result by 4. The number in this case is 1, which can be verified easily by working backward. To consolidate the undo rule, this mode of explanation should continue for a few more sample values of k. As a result of working with more examples, not only do students need to know how to solve for the pre-image n when given the image k, they also need to get a sense of the undoing process and develop an understanding  91 of inverses. It is crucial that students  23 79 are able to generalize this process of   finding the unknown code to express the undo rule algebraically as  67 51 23 79 23 xxx 55 23 111 ( ) k n which is the equation of the inverse function.

"With the encryption and decryption processes in place, students can be given time to communicate with one another through encoded messages. It is not sufficient, however, for them to simply learn through listening, watching, and practicing. For students to learn with understanding, they must also have opportunities to construct knowledge through their own activities so that they develop a personal investment in building knowledge (Carpenter and Lehrer 1999). Hence, to support this kind of learning, teachers can tell students that the evil Lord Voldemort has discovered and cracked the current encryption and decryption process and that Harry and his two friends will have to develop a new system. Students are asked to help the three friends create a new lock and key for transmitting coded messages. They are permitted to modify the existing coding system given in table 1 as well. This task was not implemented at the in-service workshop. Instead, some time was spent discussing ideas for further extensions that can be introduced into the classroom activity described in this article. One extension is discussed below.  an extension: introdUCing CoMPosite fUnCtions In the original activity, a ciphertext is generated by substituting the coded plaintext into a linear function L(n) once. To incorporate the concept of  composite functions, the encryption process previously described can be revised to include more than one cycle of substitution using either the same function L(n) or different ones. Take, for instance, the case of encrypting Harry’s first message by the linear function L(n) = 4n + 3, one after another. After the first cycle of substitution into L(n), the first three letters in the message, P, L, and E, are encrypted and translated into the corresponding codes 67, 51, and 23. When they are substituted into L(n) again, these codes then become 271, 207, and 95, respectively (see table 3). The letters P, L, and E now correspond to the codes 271, 207, and 95. Subsequently, students can be asked to find the remaining codes. Following that, teachers can promote thinking and reasoning skills by encouraging students to determine a single function that will also produce the same outcomes. It is crucial for students both to deduce that LS(n) = 16n + 15 is the linear function permitting such a “shortcut” as well as to explain how it is derived.",29,mtms2008-09-114a,,
"Another challenging task for stuents is to select two different linear functions, L1(n) and L2(n), and investigate whether the composite functions L1 L2 and L2 L1 are the same by generating and then comparing the ciphertexts obtained. However, it is important to monitor the students’ choice of functions, given that certain functions, such as the following two pairs, could mislead students into  31 23 23 115 thinking that composite functions are always commutative: L1(n) = 2x and L2(n) = 3x, as well as L1(n) = x + 3 and L2(n) = x + 2. Students who happen to choose functions like these might make the wrong conclusion simply based on one example. Therefore, teachers should advise students to test other functions so that they realize that the composite functions L1 L2 and L2 L1 are not necessarily the same. Hence, the commutative law does not generally apply here. ",30,mtms2008-09-114a,,

"This article describes some interesting classroom activities involving the use of a function in encrypting an original message to produce ciphertext. To recover the original message, the inverse function is used to decipher the ciphertext. Set in a context  familiar to students, the activities align with objectives in Principles and Standards (NCTM 2000). Students are given opportunities to explore and investigate, abstract and generalize, conjecture and verify, as well as communicate in mathematics. ",32,mtms2008-09-114a,,
"The next time students ask why it is important to learn about functions and their inverses, it is hoped that teachers can take advantage of these activities not only to introduce or consolidate certain mathematical concepts and algorithms but also to explain and convince students of their importance and relevance in real life. By doing so, students may be able to regard mathematics as an essential part of their culture, as well as to appreciate and enjoy it just as they enjoy art and music.",33,mtms2008-09-114a,,
