"Modular arithmetic (also called clock arithmetic) is a system where numbers “wrap around” after they reach a certain value. For example, face clocks “wrap around” after 12 hours. Suppose the current time is 6:00 a.m. In 14 hours, you may initially think that time is 6 + 14 = 20. But because the clock “wraps around” every 12 hours, the time is 20 – 12 = 8, or 8:00 p.m. We say “20 mod 12 is equivalent to 8” and write it as 20 mod 12 ≡ 8.",0,mtms2012-10-144a,,

"I tried this activity with several different groups of seventh-grade and eighth-grade algebra students on the Friday of a very long week. The students were ready for something different. Many had become rusty with long division, so this cartoon provided a good opportunity to break their dependence on calculators. We practiced the mental math  of finding quotients and remainders before we plunged into the questions. We worked through the first question as a whole class, with volunteers suggesting numbers that would produce a remainder of 6 when divided by 12. I recorded guesses on the board in the form of the expression in the first question. Someone in each class eventually realized that there was a pattern. We then put the information into a data table to further analyze the pattern and produced an equation in slope-intercept form. The students worked with partners to complete the rest of the questions without any difficulty.",19,mtms2012-10-144a,,

"This activity was very challenging for my fifth graders. Even my high achievers had some difficulties, so it was a brain stretcher for sure. The students worked individually to solve all the problems, and most asked for no help until they reached the modular arithmetic section. They thought they knew how to solve all the word problems in the assignment except for that one. ",24,mtms2012-10-144a,,
"Some students made only calculation errors on questions 1-3. None of my students knew about “mod time” (as they call it) so prior to completing this portion of the lesson, I taught a mini lesson to demonstrate how to calculate modular arithmetic. Almost all were successful with the “mod time” problems after our mini lesson. They taught their friends who were not even in our class what it was and how to solve problems like those. You know it is a success when students  b.  If you obtain a remainder of 16, then you have not exhausted all groups of 15 that can be pulled out of the dividend. You would have to increase the quotient by 1 to account for the additional group of 15. The remainder would be 1.",25,mtms2012-10-144a,,

I created game questions with  modular arithmetic and used some of those questions periodically in a spiral review game for our end-of-year testing.
