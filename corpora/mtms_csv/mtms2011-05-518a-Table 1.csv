"Creating Transnational Mathematics Classrooms refugee children face a number of challenges in school, such as— •	 xenophobic	attitudes	(fear	or	 •	 •	 hatred of strangers) in and out of school (UNHCR 2006); interrupted	or	limited	previous	 schooling (Miller 2009); linguistic	and	cultural	differences	 that may hamper communication (Miller 2009); and •	 behavioral	challenges	that	may	 include hoarding, aggression, difficulty with authority, failure to	concentrate,	and	explosive	 anger (Strekalova and Hoot 2008; Szente, Hoot, and Taylor 2006).",47,mtms2011-05-518a,,
"How can teachers support students with these challenges and find ways to empower them academically and socially? How can they build on students’ prior knowledge and create classrooms that respond to their needs? While recommending possible pathways for effective classroom teaching and learning with newcomer refugee students, we will discuss four main elements of this approach and the meaning of the underlying central vision, that of a transnational mathematics identity.  eleMent 1: RecogniZing  stUdents’ BacKgRoUnds",48,mtms2011-05-518a,,
Where can we find information that will help us understand our students’ backgrounds? An important starting point for developing inclusive class-,49,mtms2011-05-518a,,
"On my first day with my new class, I scan the class list and see several unfamiliar names. I ask a colleague about it, and she says, “There is a new refugee resettlement agency in the area, and they are placing newcomer families in the housing project near the school. So their children are coming to us.” Standing in the hallway, I wonder: “Where are they from? Do they speak English? Have they gone to school before? How can I prepare to teach them?”",50,mtms2011-05-518a,,
"This scenario may have sounded like fiction a few years ago. But with the number of forcibly misplaced children around the world on the rise (UNHCR 2006), this reality may be increasingly familiar. Newcomer ",51,mtms2011-05-518a,,

Two possible sources of information are  the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Web site (www .unhcr.org) and the Migration Policy Institute’s (MPI) Web site (www .migrationpolicy.org). These two sites contain information about various countries and the journeys of different groups of people to help us understand where our students are coming from and what hardships and joys they may	have	recently	experienced.	For	 instance, although the transfer into refugee camps may be a challenge, reaching a destination such as the United States can be considered an end to a hard journey and a beginning to	a	new,	exciting	life.	Likewise,	living	 in challenging conditions can become a source of resilience and strength. ",52,mtms2011-05-518a,,
"Newcomer refugee students’  relationship to mathematics does not have to be created from scratch. These students have mathematics knowledge and evolving mathematics identities that we can build from and enhance. Their mathematics background has most likely been developed in formal and informal learning situations in native countries or refugee camps. They may not know the terminology in English (Miller 2009), but they may be familiar with the concepts that we are	trying	to	teach.	For	example,	they	 may not know the term perimeter, but they may understand how to find the distance around a polygon.",53,mtms2011-05-518a,,
"eleMent 2: Using MateRial that engages all stUdents How can we scaffold learning opportunities for newcomer students? An important substep is to analyze teaching	material	and	expand	our	 repertoire beyond our classroom and country.	For	example,	addressing	 the	complex	phenomenon	of	human	 migration, including reasons for and responses to forced migration, allows students to critically engage a topic of global significance in combination with mathematics learning. ",54,mtms2011-05-518a,,
"Gathering, organizing, representing, and interpreting data associated with human migration and other transnational themes (e.g., world hunger, access to education, and economic welfare) are important processes and can provide relevant activities for middle	school	students.	Examining	patterns and making predictions fit well with	these	explorations,	which	also	 serve the middle school mathematics Standards (NCTM 2000). ",55,mtms2011-05-518a,,
"We do not want to focus too much on students’ native countries to avoid triggering homesickness or potentially negative memories, but we do want to go beyond the borders of our country with our lessons. This journey can be beneficial to not only newcomer students but also all students. If new students volunteer information about their	experiences,	we	should	welcome	 it but not solicit it. Instead, opt for indirect ways to include all students without emphasizing differences. It is appropriate to ask, “Can anyone show or	explain	how	to	do	division	in	another country?” instead of “Tuan, how do students do division in Vietnam?” eleMent 3: iMPleMenting inclUsiVe teaching Methods",56,mtms2011-05-518a,,
"What teaching methods should be used with newcomers? The answer is not universal. Multiple teaching methods are required to address diversity in student learning styles and	background	experiences.	Varied	 methods allow students to engage in those they find familiar and learn new approaches.	For	example,	when	the	 first author came to the United States as a newcomer in graduate studies, she was initially appalled by frequent use  of small-group discussions and tasks. She did not value these unfamiliar teaching methods. However, a gradual introduction to dominant instructional approaches eventually led her to appreciate their potential benefits. Students transitioning to a new culture may not know all the rules inherent in a mathematics classroom. Teachers should help students learn classroom	routines	and	expectations.	",57,mtms2011-05-518a,,

eleMent 4: cReating oPPoRtUnities to Bond,59,mtms2011-05-518a,,
"How can we foster a classroom environment that is safe and academically enriching? One aspect of building a healthy and productive classroom community is recognizing and emphasizing similarities among students’ lives and between teacher and students. This can form a safe foundation from which to	explore	differences.	For	instance,	 relocation	is	a	key	experience	of	newcomer refugees, which can be shared with those who have moved within the borders of their own country.",60,mtms2011-05-518a,,
"Creating lessons and problems developed from current events of local or global significance can simultaneously engage	students	in	contextualized	 mathematics learning and enhance awareness	of	current	issues.	For	 instance, to tie in the recent housing crisis, students might be asked to analyze graphs of house values over time locally and elsewhere in the country and world. A comparative analysis among geographic regions can sharpen students’ critical-thinking skills and global	understandings	while	exercising	 key middle school mathematics skills.",61,mtms2011-05-518a,,
"These	types	of	explorations	can	 build mathematics skills and agency, in addition to fostering social bonding among students. These goals can also  be achieved through group work and using	technology.	Lessons	might	be	 crafted around information provided by the United Nations Global Teaching	and	Learning	Project	Cyberschoolbus (http://www.cyberschool bus.un.org/). Students can access quizzes+games on the home page and grapple with world problems that involve	mathematics	skills.	For	example,	 lessons structured around the disaster simulation game Stop Disasters can help students identify with one another through common environmental issues while sharpening mathematics and critical-thinking skills. The use of such video games builds on popular youth culture to help students relate to classroom material and one another. ",62,mtms2011-05-518a,,

"In our increasingly interdependent world, transnational mathematics understanding benefits all students. Castles (2003) defines transnational communities as “groups based in two or more countries that engage in recurrent, enduring and significant cross-border activities, which may be economic, political, social or cultural in character” (p. 20). If we imagine transnational mathematics classrooms having a similar scope, they would engage in “recurrent, enduring, and significant” mathematics activities that	extend	beyond	the	borders	of	 one’s own nation.",64,mtms2011-05-518a,,
"The overarching goal of our approach is to create spaces of belonging for all students, including those who may be newcomer refugees. This can occur if we recognize both similarities and differences in students’ approaches to learning mathematics.",65,mtms2011-05-518a,,
"We may not know how to reach all students on the first day of class. However, if we try the general approaches outlined here to engage students, we can help them develop powerful mathematics identities. Martin (2009)  defines mathematics identity as “the dispositions and deeply held beliefs that individuals develop about their ability to participate and perform effectively	in	mathematical	contexts	and	to	 use mathematics to change the conditions of their lives” (p. 136). Promoting transnational mathematics identity could enhance student performance in mathematics and other academic areas.",66,mtms2011-05-518a,,
"We are not proposing that people leave their location to travel abroad, seeking information about world events and cultures. Students and community members can serve as resources. By developing instructional activities that allow students to draw on and voluntarily share their differing life experiences,	these	students	can	show	 us how to become more globally aware mathematics instructors. Technological innovations can also assist us in finding relevant content and in engaging all students.

"Our goal is not to overemphasize differences or create more work for already busy teachers. The framework we propose is not about and for newcomer refugee and immigrant students only. This vision is for all students in our classrooms, who will grow to become members of an increasingly interconnected world. The proposed framework,	which	attends	explicitly	to	global	 topics such as relocation across and within national borders, can engage a broad range of students.",68,mtms2011-05-518a,,
