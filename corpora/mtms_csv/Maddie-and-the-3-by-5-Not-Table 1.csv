3,Maddie and the 3 by 5 Note Card,"During a unit on geometry, my class was studying segment and angle relationships along with parallel lines and triangle relationships. A student, Maddie, asked me for a problem that was more challenging than those we had been solving. Thus, “Maddie and the 3 × 5 Note Card” was born. With this activity, I wanted to draw in Rabindranath Tagore’s thought, to “knock at the door of the mind,” by exploring geometric relationships to determine the length of a crease in a typical 3 × 5 note card.

8,Maddie and the 3 by 5 Note Card,This activity addresses four of the Common Core’s eight Standards for Mathematical Practice: (1) Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them; (2) reason abstractly and quantitatively; (3) construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others; and (4) model with mathematics (CCSSI 2010). ,8,Maddie and the 3 by 5 Note Card

10,Maddie and the 3 by 5 Note Card,Each student was given a 3 × 5 note card (see ﬁ g. 1a). Students were told to fold the note card so that point B coincided with point D (see ﬁ g. 1b). ,10,Maddie and the 3 by 5 Note Card
11,Maddie and the 3 by 5 Note Card,"When the card is unfolded, a crease can be seen. Their task was to determine the length of the crease without measuring. For a challenge, encourage students to fi nd the length of the crease as an exact number value and not a decimal approximation. ",11,Maddie and the 3 by 5 Note Card

13,Maddie and the 3 by 5 Note Card,"After note cards were distributed, students were given the rest of the class period to work in small groups to discuss the task and possible approaches to fi nding the length of the crease. Teachers could ask the following leading questions if groups appear to be at a standstill:  1. Fold point D to meet point B. ",13,Maddie and the 3 by 5 Note Card
14,Maddie and the 3 by 5 Note Card,"What do you notice?  2. If the length of AE is x, what can  you tell me about the length of BE? FC? DF? DE?  3. Fold point A to point C. What  comparisons can you now make? 4. Can lines be added so that there are right triangles? What do you know about the triangles that are formed?  5. Could the note card be placed on a coordinate system? How could that be done? ",14,Maddie and the 3 by 5 Note Card
15,Maddie and the 3 by 5 Note Card,"For your classroom, another option is to give small groups of students five to ten minutes to discuss solution strategies and then have groups share different strategies with the entire class. Afterward, students can continue to work in their groups, where they may decide to alter or change their strategies based on the classroom discussion.",15,Maddie and the 3 by 5 Note Card
16,Maddie and the 3 by 5 Note Card,"At the end of the class, students were instructed to continue working on the task at home (which was over a weekend) and to write down their solutions. Students who wanted more of a challenge, like Maddie, were asked to generalize the problem, imaging that the note card had dimensions of a × b, where a < b. The next class, students were asked to share their strategies for finding the solution. Shared solutions included both a coordinate approach and a geometric approach (see the online solutions for details).",16,Maddie and the 3 by 5 Note Card
17,Maddie and the 3 by 5 Note Card,"If a teacher decides to give students a more structured approach to this problem, we have included an activity that you can use with your students to obtain the solution to the 3 × 5 note card problem that leads students to a coordinate approach. I (author Samide) used this task with my students at Wheaton North High School in Wheaton, Illinois; with my seventh-grade and eighth-grade students in the Talent Search Program  at the College of DuPage in Glen Ellyn, Illinois; and with my students at Montini Catholic High School in Lombard, Illinois. The activity sheet (see p. 120), 3 × 5 cards, and graph paper are distributed to students in groups of two or three. It is important that each student has a note card with which to work.",17,Maddie and the 3 by 5 Note Card

19,Maddie and the 3 by 5 Note Card,"To determine if students can apply their solution method to a new scenario, a follow-up activity would have students repeat the process for different size note cards. Half of the class could be given a 4 × 6 card and the other half a 5 × 8 card. For those students who are ready for the challenge, have them generalize with a note card that is a × b where a < b. For the general case, the solution found to the 3 × 5 applies to any size note card and determine that the solution to the a × b note card is a 2 + b 2 .",19,Maddie and the 3 by 5 Note Card
20,Maddie and the 3 by 5 Note Card,"I (co-author Dewey) used the complete activity—3 × 5, 4 × 6,  5 × 8, and general a × b cards—in my school’s math club, composed mainly of ninth-grade students who are currently taking a geometry class. All approached the task from a geometric perspective. The discussion that led to a solution strategy included a variety of other geometry topics including symmetry, triangle types, right triangle trigonometry ratios, and even trapezoids. Students found the problem both engaging and intriguing. Both a geometric approach and a coordinate approach to the solution can be found online at http://www.",20,Maddie and the 3 by 5 Note Card

This quote has had a positive impact on our teaching. “Maddie and the 3 × 5 Note Card” gives students the opportunity to explore real mathematics through a simple note card.",22,Maddie and the 3 by 5 Note Card
