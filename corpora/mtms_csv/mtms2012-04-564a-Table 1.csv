"A word cloud, also known as a tag cloud, is a graphic representation that illustrates the important words that appear in a body of text. The words are proportional in size to their frequency of use or importance in the text. This article explores three aspects of a word cloud. First, I trace the origin of word clouds and their usage in blogs and other social media sites as they evolved into a valuable organizational and communication tool that can be used in the classroom. Second, I provide directions for teachers to create word clouds for use in the classroom. Third, I present two ways I have incorporated these images in my mathematics classroom.

"One of the earliest appearances of word clouds occurred in Microserfs (Coupland 1995). Within the next decade, word clouds began to appear on social media and Web 2.0 information sharing sites, such as Flickr® and Delicious. Within the last two years, word clouds started making their way into social studies and language arts classrooms. I first saw a word cloud in a social studies classroom. That particular example was based on the Declaration of Independence. Inspired by this image, I created a similar word ",5,mtms2012-04-564a,,

One can see how it shows the importance of the various concepts— laws, states, government, colonies, people. I was intrigued by how this word cloud tool might be used in my mathematics classroom.",6,mtms2012-04-564a,,

"Many free web-based tools are available that can be used to create word clouds; each one has its pros and cons. I recommend two: www.wordle.net and www.tagxedo.com. Both Wordle™ and Tagxedo allow the user to change the font, color, and layout of the word cloud. I find Wordle to be more userfriendly; however, Wordle only creates clouds, whereas Tagxedo can create the word cloud and present it in a specific shape (see fig. 2).",8,mtms2012-04-564a,,
Two options are available when creating a word cloud using either website. One option is to copy and paste text found on the Internet or from a document; another option is for the user to generate his or her own list of words. ,9,mtms2012-04-564a,,

The user can choose  the background color as well as the number and variety of colors, allowing the user’s Wordle to coincide with a theme. I chose red, white, and blue to represent the United States when creating my Declaration of Independence Wordle (see fig. 1). ",13,mtms2012-04-564a,,

"Sometimes valuable information comes in small  packages, which is the idea behind this call for  manuscripts for “Quick Reads.” It will consist of  manuscripts that are approximately 1200 to 1800 words that contain a single, well-developed idea.  Although “Quick Reads” may cover a wide range of  topics, the Editorial Panel is particularly interested  in receiving manuscripts that fit in one of the  following three categories: 1. A quick read on a single topic 2. A quick read on research 3. A quick read on collaborations",16,mtms2012-04-564a,,

"screen capture of the image and paste it into another file. The image can then be cropped to include the word cloud only.  using Word clouds  in Math class I began incorporating word clouds in my ninth-grade geometry classroom to introduce lesson vocabulary. Before beginning a preassessment lesson, for example, I would display the word cloud, and the class would be asked to discuss and identify both familiar and  unfamiliar words (see fig. 3). With some concepts, such as area, the students knew all the vocabulary words before we started the lesson. This boosted the students’ confidence about the upcoming material they would be learning. Even if the students did not know the meanings of the words, they enjoyed seeing a synopsis of the upcoming lesson. They also began to  complain if I did not make a word cloud for a particular lesson. ",20,mtms2012-04-564a,,
"I got into the habit of using word clouds with my students almost daily. At the end of the school year, I challenged them to make one. The assignment was to create a word cloud of the topics we had studied throughout the year in geometry. I reminded them that the larger words in a word cloud either appear often or are the most important. I directed the students to also take into account the proportional sizes of the words in the word cloud. I, too, created a word cloud to get an idea of how the size of the words should relate to one another. I made a list of vocabulary and topics that appeared in each section and kept a tally of the ones that appeared more than once. Then I typed the list of words, one time for each tally, into a Microsoft Word file and copied it into Wordle (see fig. 4). ",21,mtms2012-04-564a,,
"The students did not have any  trouble creating a word cloud. The only obstacle they encountered was keeping two-word phrases such as Pythagorean theorem together in the word cloud (see fig. 5). They quickly discovered that if they typed “Pythagorean theorem” into the generator surrounded by quotes, the phrase would show up on their word cloud as one term.  giving it a try",22,mtms2012-04-564a,,
Word clouds are not only a useful classroom tool but also visually pleasing. Websites such as Wordle or Tagxedo are free and are safe web tools that can be used by teachers and students as study aids or powerful graphic organizers. Teachers can also produce art for a word wall. It is extremely easy to make a word cloud. Paste in text and see how it can shape your mathematics lesson.,23,mtms2012-04-564a,,
