What Silent Participants Might Be Learning in Discourse-Rich Classrooms,1,mtms2007-12-305a,,
"Amy F. Hillen and Margaret S. Smith cCommunication is an important part  of classrooms in which students are engaged in challenging mathematics (NCTM 2000). Students communicate by “participating in social interaction, sharing thoughts with others, and listening to others share their ideas” (Hiebert et al. 1997). As students take part in sharing their mathematical thinking, they have opportunities to make and justify conjectures, consider the validity of others’ ideas, engage in mathematical argumentation, and reflect on their current understandings (NCTM 2000). Thus, the mathematical discourse in classrooms provides important opportunities for students ",2,mtms2007-12-305a,,

"While mathematical discussion  occurs in the classroom, teachers must attend to a number of issues, such as who should speak when, why, and for how long. In addition, they also need to think about who is not speaking, why, and for how long while ensuring that important mathematical ideas of the lesson are made public (NCTM 2000, p. 271). One concern that might be raised for teachers and teacher educators who are creating discourse-rich learning environments is what might be learned by participants who remain silent during such discussions. In this article, we examine the mathematical learning of one silent participant—a preservice secondary mathematics teacher enrolled in an advanced methods course that included both preservice and practicing teachers. We begin by considering what these mathematics teachers could learn by participating in class discussions.",6,mtms2007-12-305a,,

"A discussion occurred during the second week of a fifteen-week master’slevel mathematics methods course. It focused on proportional reasoning in the middle grades and gave teachers an opportunity to consider the nature of proportional relationships. Teachers first solved the three problems shown in figure 1 (identified as the Snake, Tent, and Age problems) and shared their solutions publicly. They were then asked to work in small groups and consider how the three problems were similar and how they were different. During the wholeclass discussion, teachers identified how these similarities and differences illuminate aspects of proportional relationships. For example, Elaine (teachers’ names are pseudonyms) noted that the Tent problem was ",8,mtms2007-12-305a,,

In the Snake problem, “You added three feet to both of them.” In the Age problem, “They were six . . . years apart.” Christopher added that if you created a graph for the Tent problem, both tents and scouts would start at the origin because if there were zero tents, then zero scouts could be housed. He also observed that as the tents increase by one, the number of scouts increases by three. Melanie added, “That’s why it’s multiplicative . . . because you’re not adding the same amount each time like you are in the snake and the age [problems]. You’re adding three times as many scouts each time you add a tent.” Kyle noted that only the relationship between tents and scouts was proportional, as shown in the following excerpt: ",12,mtms2007-12-305a,,
Kyle: ,13,mtms2007-12-305a,,

I think the Tent [problem] is the only one that has a constant of proportionality.",17,mtms2007-12-305a,,

"The cost of admission to the state park is $1.00 for each person in a vehicle, plus $3.00 for parking the vehicle.",23,mtms2007-12-305a,,
"The cost of admission to the zoo is $5.00 per person. (There is no charge for parking.) tional relationships are multiplicative rather than additive, that is, one number is a multiple of the other. Proportional relationships can be expressed symbolically as y = kx, where k is the constant of proportionality. Proportional relationships are depicted by graphed lines that contain the origin (0, 0), since only 0 is a multiple of 0. Understanding the mathematical relationships that are embedded in proportional relationships—and how they are related—is critical to one’s capacity to reason proportionally (Cramer, Post, and Currier 1993). These key ideas about proportional relationships were revisited in subsequent classes as teachers explored additional problems. For example, the park and zoo situations (shown in fig. 2), discussed in week 11 of the course, provided an opportunity for teachers to again consider what characterizes a proportional situation. The zoo situation is proportional, whereas the park situation is not. During the wholeclass discussion, Kyle’s small group had “reached the conclusion that all proportions are linear, but not all linear relationships are proportional.” Several teachers agreed and commented that a y-intercept other than 0 “ruined” the multiplicative relationship between quantities. Thus, only linear relationships whose y-intercept was 0 were truly multiplicative and therefore proportional. In the excerpt that follows, teachers use the park situation to help explain why linear relationships with y-intercepts other than 0 are not proportional. ",24,mtms2007-12-305a,,
"Nora:   Well, when you have a  y-intercept that’s not 0, it changes the constant of proportionality between two different points on the line. ",25,mtms2007-12-305a,,
"Instructor:  Say that again, or add  something to it. ",26,mtms2007-12-305a,,
"Nora:   OK. So I was going to say, like, if you have 7 people, the cost is $10 to get into the park . . . and the constant there would be 10/7. Instructor:  OK. [The fraction 10/7 is recorded on an overhead transparency.]",27,mtms2007-12-305a,,

Instructor:  OK. [The fraction 4/1 is written on an overhead transparency.] So these are not— the same. ,30,mtms2007-12-305a,,

The ratio between them’s not the same. So they’re not proportional.,32,mtms2007-12-305a,,
"The discussion of the park and zoo situations also featured several teachers who had not contributed to the earlier discussion. During the discussion, teachers brought up the key distinctions between proportional and nonproportional relationships: Proportional relationships are multiplicative  rather than additive, are depicted by graphed lines that contain the origin, and have a constant of proportionality. In addition, the idea was raised that the ratio between the quantities is consistent in proportional situations. It is obvious from the two discussions summarized here that key ideas related to proportional relationships were made public during the course. Does someone have to participate publicly in a discussion to learn something from it? Hatano and Inagaki (1991) argue that group discussions are important because— [a] group as a whole usually has a richer data base than any of its members for problem solving. It is likely that no individual member has acquired or has ready access to all needed pieces of information, but every piece is owned by at least one member in the group. (p. 341)",33,mtms2007-12-305a,,
"Thus, during group discussions, all participants, even silent ones, have the opportunity to “collect more pieces of information about the issue of the discussion and to understand the issue more deeply” (Hatano and Inagaki 1991, p. 346). Inagaki and colleagues also suggest that silent students are in fact actively participating in discussions, even though they are not speaking (Hatano and Inagaki 1991; Inagaki, Hatano, and Morita 1998). Hatano and Inagaki describe active participation:",34,mtms2007-12-305a,,
"Silent members may be actively participating. They can learn much by observing the ongoing discussion or debate carefully. This is often characterized as a vicarious process, but it is more than that. In a sense, these students are all trying to find an agent, someone who really speaks for them. A good agent or vocal participant can articulate what a silent member has been trying without success to say. (p. 346) conSidering tHe  leArning oF urSulA",35,mtms2007-12-305a,,
"In the remainder of the article, we focus on Ursula, one of fifteen teachers enrolled in the mathematics methods course from which earlier excerpts were taken. The purpose of the course was to help teachers develop their own understandings about proportional reasoning and proportional relationships and to develop their capacity for providing meaningful learning opportunities for their students. Toward this end, teachers engaged in a variety of activities to meet these goals. Each activity in the course was enacted in three phases: (1) beginning to work on the activity individually; (2) continuing to work with a partner or small group; and (3) engaging in a whole-class discussion. The whole class discussions made up a large portion of total class time—over 50 percent. ",36,mtms2007-12-305a,,
"During the course, Ursula made the fewest public contributions and spoke during the fewest number of discussions. Out of 16 discussions over 4 1/2 hours of class across 15 classes (278 minutes), Ursula publicly contributed to only 5 discussions for a total of 11 contributions. (Many other discussions in the course focused on other aspects of knowledge needed for teaching, i.e., pedagogy, students as learners. Since our focus here is on mathematics learning, we have limited our analysis to those discussions that focused on making sense of mathematics.) By contrast, the remaining teachers contributed an average of 76.6 contributions. Thus, Ursula was, for the most part, a silent participant during the course. What did Ursula learn? Despite her relative silence during the course, pre- and postassessments suggest that she learned important aspects of proportional reasoning. For example, she used a broader range of solution strategies, improved her capacity to distinguish between proportional ",37,mtms2007-12-305a,,

It is also important to note that these are the same mathematical ideas that the other teachers, including those who were more vocal, learned during the course. For example, although Ursula was limited in her ability to identify proportional relationships at the beginning of the course, by the end of the course, she had no difficulty  distinguishing proportional from nonproportional situations. In an end-ofcourse interview, Ursula was presented with tables and graphs (shown in fig. 3) that depicted the relationship between time and the amount of snow on the ground for two cities. When asked whether either situation reflected a proportional relationship, Ursula correctly identified the Cedar Rapids situation as being proportional, as explained on the next page:",44,mtms2007-12-305a,,
Ursula: ,45,mtms2007-12-305a,,

Because it does not have the same scale factor. ,56,mtms2007-12-305a,,
"Interviewer: And—how did you determine that it doesn’t have the same scale factor? Ursula:  Well, it would be, you have to multiply by 6.5 to get 6.5 inches of snow, and then to get 7.5, you have to multiply by 2.5, and then you have to multiply by 1.7 to get 8.5 inches of snow, and uh, you have to multiply 7 by 1.357 to get 9.5. [See the table of values in fig. 3.]",57,mtms2007-12-305a,,
Interviewer: OK. So—so what’s—,58,mtms2007-12-305a,,
Ursula:  what’s scale factor? What do you mean by scale factor?,59,mtms2007-12-305a,,
"So it’s the—when multiplied by the total hours, it’s consistent. First of all it’s consistent throughout the problem, in the one that’s proportional . . . and so when you multiply  through by each one, you come up with the inches of snow on the ground. So it enables you to determine the amount of snow. ",60,mtms2007-12-305a,,
"In this excerpt, Ursula demonstrates  her capacity to distinguish between a proportional and a nonproportional relationship. In addition, she provides an appropriate rationale for the distinction—that proportional relationships have a multiplicative constant that relates the quantities, which Ursula identifies as the scale factor. Thus, although Ursula never contributed to discussions about distinguishing proportional relationships from those that are not or about the nature of proportional relationships, the data clearly show that she developed some understandings about proportional relationships. In fact, data collected from a subsequent course focused on algebra provide evidence that she was able to spontaneously draw on her knowledge of proportional relationships when appropriate. ",61,mtms2007-12-305a,,
"During the algebra course (offered  the semester following the proportional reasoning course), teachers were asked to work with their small groups to create a real-world situation that depicted a functional relationship and then to (1) sketch a graph of their relationship; (2) state the relationship using the language of functions; (3) build a chart or table with numbers that might go with their relationship; (4) explain the graph and the chart as ways of presenting the same information in different forms; and (5) explain how their example meets the requirements of the formal definition of a function. The teachers had worked on this task individually for a few minutes and then in small groups for approximately ten minutes. The instructor then called the small groups together for a group discussion. ",62,mtms2007-12-305a,,
The instructor asked for volunteers  to share their examples of real-world ,63,mtms2007-12-305a,,
"Fig. 4 The graph of the car wash context created by Ursula and her group functions with the class. Bruce and Lisa volunteered Ursula, a member of their group, to present their example to the class. Their example featured a car wash context in which the amount of money earned was a function of the number of cars washed at $5 per car. In Ursula’s first statement to the class, she introduced the idea of proportionality:",64,mtms2007-12-305a,,
"All right, so what we did was, we came up with washing cars as our example. So if you were having a car wash, the number of cars you washed and then the money earned from that. So part (a) is the graph, and so we just graphed hypothetically what it would look like. And our graph [shown in fig. 4] is also proportional. ",65,mtms2007-12-305a,,
"After Ursula’s statement, the instructor (who had also taught the course on proportional reasoning) commented that it was interesting but did not press her to clarify or explain what she meant by “proportional” and how she knew it. Instead, the instructor let Ursula continue her presentation, which included a description of the different representations that depicted the relationship and an explanation of why their relationship was a function. When she had finished, the instructor returned to Ursula’s statement that her  group’s example reflected a proportional situation:",66,mtms2007-12-305a,,
I want to go back to a comment that Ursula made initially. About it being proportional. Do you want to tell us  . . . a little more about that?,67,mtms2007-12-305a,,
"In response to the instructor’s question, Ursula commented: ",68,mtms2007-12-305a,,
"Well, it’s proportionalfirst of all it goes to the origin, so, that’s one reason. And then, the number [amount] of moneyit’s increasing by 5 each time. So for every number of cars increases the money earned increases by 5. ",69,mtms2007-12-305a,,
"Ursula’s comment draws on the idea that proportional relationships are depicted by lines that contain the origin, which was made public multiple times and by multiple teachers during the proportional reasoning course. Thus, although Ursula remained silent during the discussions related to the nature of proportional relationships, when pressed to explain why a relationship was proportional, she could clearly do soboth immediately following the course and several months later during the algebra course.  concluSion",70,mtms2007-12-305a,,
"In this article, we have argued that a silent teacher learned the same mathematics as her more vocal colleagues. This echoes Inagaki, Hatano, and Morita’s (1998) finding that no significant difference occurred between silent and vocal fourth and fifth graders when verifying their ability to add fractions of different denominators following a class discussion. This is important, given the suggested role of public discourse in mathematics classrooms at all levels (NCTM 2000). This finding suggests that successful class discussions (i.e., ones that have the potential to support learning) are those in which the mathematical ideas  are made public. Several other aspects of the discussions described herein may be critical in supporting learning. First, teachers explored challenging mathematical tasks (Stein, Grover, and Henningsen 1996) that had multiple entry points and could be solved using multiple approaches, and they were encouraged to consider different solution paths. During class discussions, the instructor asked questions that went beyond gathering information about teachers’ solution strategies, and challenged them to consider key mathematical concepts and relationships (Boaler and Humpheys 2005). In addition, the instructor facilitated teachers’ learning during the discussions by revoicing (O’Connor and Michaels 1996) their contributions, which summarized and highlighted the important mathematics ideas of each discussion. Although the discussions reported herein involved teachers, research (e.g., Boaler and Staples, forthcoming) suggests that these features of classroom discourse serve to support students’ learning as well.",71,mtms2007-12-305a,,
"Although teachers and teacher  educators should ensure that all learners have opportunities to contribute to discussions, not all may choose to participate. As teachers and teacher educators, how do we know whether such silent participants understand? As Ursula’s story suggests, giving learners multiple ways to demonstrate their understandingworking in small groups, writing about their thinking, discussing tasks in a one-onone settingmight help reveal what silent learners know and understand.",72,mtms2007-12-305a,,
"A second question that may arise  from reading Ursula’s story is whether teachers (and teacher educators) should seek to actively engage silent learners in discussions. Although Ursula was never called on (and she rarely volunteered), it is important to note that she completed all written assignments, actively participated in  small-group work, and never appeared disengaged during wholeclass discussions. In addition, the instructor monitored small groups as they worked and gained insights from listening to what Ursula and others understood. One possibility for involving a silent participant in whole-group discussions would be to explicitly (and perhaps privately) ask a specific student to contribute an idea that he or she brought up during small-group work. Thus, although Ursula was quiet, her work during and outside class indicated that she was an active, although silent, participant in the course. Therefore, teachers and teacher educators need to help their learners understand what different forms of participation look like in a discourse-oriented classroom (i.e., public participation might involve making contributions aloud, whereas silent participation might involve listening carefully to others and reflecting on their contributions). In so doing, participants who choose to remain silent during discussions will continue to have opportunities to learn important mathematical ideas.",73,mtms2007-12-305a,,
