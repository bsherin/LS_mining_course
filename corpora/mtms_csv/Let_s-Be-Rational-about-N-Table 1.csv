22,Let_s Be Rational about Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,FIELD-TEST COMMENTS,,
23,Let_s Be Rational about Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,My eighth-grade students were immediately engaged when they learned that this was a field test and that I valued not only how they worked through the mathematics embedded in the task but also their feedback about the task itself.,,
24,Let_s Be Rational about Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"When my students argued about their responses to question 2b, I listened to their debates and asked questions to probe how they reasoned to support their evidence. What is real world? Number line? Thermometer? Altitude? Debt? Assets? My students who embraced the debtor-versus-lender scenario used correct real-world logic about their context. In much of the financial sector in the United States, the lender who holds the note with the greater debt stands to benefit most, whereas the debtor who owes the most is “in greater debt.”",,
25,Let_s Be Rational about Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Given only two numbers to compare, greater than or less than in an open, real-world context may yield unexpected results. With an open invitation to create a model for a real-world situation, teachers need to be open to the claims, evidence, and reasoning that students present to teachers and peers. Students have much to share about their perceptions and experience, and adults have much to learn about how young people see the world.",,
26,Let_s Be Rational about Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"To hone the question about the absolute values of –4 and –5, see this alternative: How would you visually illustrate and explain in words why –4 is greater than –5?",,
27,Let_s Be Rational about Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Deborah Regal Coller,,
28,Let_s Be Rational about Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I used this activity with prealgebra and algebra 1 classes. The students found it very helpful that important words were italicized in the questions, thus helping the students think about and focus on what was being asked. As I walked around the room, I heard students say the italicized words and then discuss what the words meant. I believe that a good group activity sheet would contain a lesson on types of numbers.",,
29,Let_s Be Rational about Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Students were familiar with the various types of real numbers. After a brief class discussion of each type, I let them tackle the cartoon while they worked in groups of three. They were able to complete the activity sheet with little difficulty. For question 1b, most groups answered 89 numbers rather than 90 numbers. After I asked them to consider a smaller set of numbers, they were then able to translate that logic to the larger set and understand their mistake. For question 2a, students had not encountered the term  in a while, so they needed a brief refresher on what it meant.",,
30,Let_s Be Rational about Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"They puzzled over question 3d for a while, until I asked them to think of a piece of gum that is equally shared among three kids. Then, one of the kids decides to split his or her shares with the other two, and so on. Using this example, they were able to see how there could be many fractions between 1/3 and 2/3.",,
31,Let_s Be Rational about Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,The challenge question stumped all but one student who then shared his solution with the other students. This was a great lead-in to my next lesson on converting repeating decimals into fractions.,,
32,Let_s Be Rational about Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Machele Lynch,,
33,Let_s Be Rational about Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"My eighth-grade algebra students tried this activity and loved it. The students began by completing a  three-circle Venn diagram to classify numbers, using the sets of factors of 36, prime numbers less than 20, and even numbers less than 20. They had all used a two-circle diagram to compare and contrast in other subjects, but for many students, this was the first time they had used a Venn diagram in math or had considered placing something outside the circles.",,
34,Let_s Be Rational about Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I distributed the activity, giving no directions. Students worked with a partner through all questions, without using additional resources. When everyone finished, the class discussed each question. The first question gave us an opportunity to uncover assumptions and look at things from different perspectives. As eighth graders, they are encouraged to reflect on everything from a current task to their entire middle school experience as they prepare for high school.",,
35,Let_s Be Rational about Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Some had difficulty with question 3d until a classmate suggested finding equivalent fractions. Then all agreed that there had to be an infinite number of rational numbers between the two given values. Other students wanted to confirm with their calculators that numbers such as  were nonterminating, nonrepeating decimals. Doing so helped them the next day when they were placing irrational numbers on a number line.",,
36,Let_s Be Rational about Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The class ended the lesson by creating a Venn diagram to show the relationships among the categories of numbers. After drawing a rectangle around rational and irrational numbers for the set of real numbers, someone asked why they are called “real.” That led to the inevitable, “Does that mean some numbers are not real?” We added imaginary numbers outside the rectangle and mentioned that it would come up later in the year when they were solving quadratic equations.",,
37,Let_s Be Rational about Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Pam Haner,,
38,Let_s Be Rational about Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"These problems elicited great discussion among my students. My sixth-grade prealgebra students worked on the holes in Joe’s thinking. They concluded that his answer was correct based on the homophone “hole,” but they needed to correct his misconception of whole number.",,
39,Let_s Be Rational about Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Students were unfamiliar with the term  so we analyzed the prefix to determine the meaning of the sentence in problem 2. The relationships among natural numbers, whole numbers, integers, and rational and irrational numbers were defined, discussed, and applied to the questions throughout this activity. Real-world applications of integers ranged from negative temperatures and banking to wrong answers found on",,
40,Let_s Be Rational about Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The Special Pi Day fascinated them. One student stated that we missed  Pi Day, which would have occurred on 3/14/1592.",,
41,Let_s Be Rational about Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,I included an illustration (see the student work above) of some students’ explanations for 0.999 . . . = 1. It was an amazing discussion. One sixth grader wrote an entire explanation of limits.,,
42,Let_s Be Rational about Numbers - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"As I looked at some students (with a “deer in the headlights” expression), I explained that they were mathematically traveling toward calculus and if they understood just a glimmer of what he was describing about limits, that was excellent. I suggested that they recall the book  by Madeleine L’Engle. In it, Meg is trying to understand the explanation of a  (traveling in the fourth dimension) and gets a glimmer of understanding.",,
