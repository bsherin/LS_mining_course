The CoaT CheCk Problem: a S(t)imulating Lesson,0,mtms2007-10-182a,,
"David L. Pagni cCalifornia State University, Fullerton,  partnered with local schools to offer a special program to introduce middle school students to a college campus and encourage future enrollment in college preparatory classes. As part of that program, I was asked to present a one-hour mathematics lesson to various groups of students. I decided to teach a lesson on probability because it offers hands-on experience for students and because middle school students should be able to “understand and apply basic concepts of probability” (NCTM 2000, p. 248). Based on previous teaching experience as well as work with over 300 students (10  groups of 30) who visited our campus, I found that middle school students have a good sense of the concept of the probability of an event. Many students have had experience simulating experiments by repeatedly tossing a coin, rolling a number cube, or drawing a chip from a bag. Furthermore, they can write probabilities for events, such as “get a tail”; “roll a 3”; or “draw a green chip” from a bag containing three green chips and two white chips, respectively. With this in mind, I introduced the Coat Check problem to build on that knowledge and introduce middle school students to a more complex form of simulation to ",1,mtms2007-10-182a,,
"David Pagni, dpagni@exchange.fullerton .edu, currently teaches preservice courses for middle and high school teachers at California State University, Fullerton. he has taught middle school and high school mathematics in California. he also directs a national Science Foundation Math and Science Partnership Program for mathematics teachers of grades 6–12 called teachers assisting Students to excel in Learning Mathematics (taSeL-M).",2,mtms2007-10-182a,,

"The Coat Check problem describes a situation whereby a number of women check their coats at a restaurant and receive numbered claim checks in return. When the patrons return to claim their coats, it is assumed that the attendant has lost all the claim checks and that the coats are returned at random. This question is posed: “What is the probability that at least one woman gets her own coat?”",4,mtms2007-10-182a,,
"If there are 2, 3, 4, or even 5  women, the probability of at least one woman getting her own coat can be computed by listing all possible ways the coats can be returned. For example, suppose that 3 women check their coats. Number the coats 1, 2, and 3 to correspond with woman 1, 2, and 3. Table 1 lists all the ways that the coats can be returned. ",5,mtms2007-10-182a,,
"Thus, if we assume that all ways of returning the coats are equally likely, we see that there is exactly one way that all women get their own coats; two ways that no woman gets her own coat; and three ways that exactly one woman gets her own coat. A match occurs when a woman gets her own coat. The number of matches and probabilities are displayed in table 2. Think about why it is impossible to have exactly two matches.",6,mtms2007-10-182a,,
"Note that there are six outcomes  to this experiment (six ways to return the 3 coats), which can be illustrated by a tree diagram (see fig. 1). There are 3 choices for the coat to be given to woman 1; after that, there are 2 choices for the coat to be given to woman 2 and only 1 choice for the coat to be given to woman 3. Thus, by the fundamental counting principle, there are 3 × 2 × 1, or 6, possible ways to return the three coats.  table 1 Ways of returning coats",7,mtms2007-10-182a,,

Suppose that four women are each checking a coat. In how many ways could the coats be returned to the women? 10,16,mtms2007-10-182a,,
"According to our thinking, there would 120 be 4 × 3 × 2 × 1, or 24, different ways (4 choices for the coat to be given to women 1, 3 choices for woman 2, 2 choices for woman 3, and 1 choice for woman 4).

Suggest 265 that each pair of students perform ten 720 trials to simulate the experiment of returning the four coats at random. Tell students that everyone’s results will be pooled to get an idea of the probability of 0, 1, 2, or 4 people getting their own coat.

"Next, have the pair of students count the number of matches and write that number in parentheses to the right of the outcome (e.g., 1, 3, 4, 2 (1)). In this example, there is one match because only the first person got his or her own coat. Check with several teams, asking each team to tell you the outcome and number of matches for that outcome. Table 3 contains examples of possible outcomes. ",27,mtms2007-10-182a,,
"Observing students working in pairs will allow you to ensure that everyone knows what is expected for each trial. After checking a sample (or even all) of the outcomes for the first trial, have students conduct nine more trials in the same manner. For each trial, the pair should draw four numbers one at a time from the bag, record the results, then return the numbered cards to the bag to repeat the trial. ",28,mtms2007-10-182a,,

"When all pairs have completed the experiment for all ten trials, ask them to organize their data by totaling the number of matches, telling you, the teacher, the number of outcomes that are at 0, 1, 2, and 4 matches, respectively. As each pair calls out the four numbers representing the results of their simulation, write the numbers on the board or on chart paper. Discuss students’ results, having them note that the sum of the number of matches must be 10, representing their ten trials. See table 4 for a sample of data from one group of 30 students (15 teams).",30,mtms2007-10-182a,,
"In this example, we pooled the class  results to complete the experimental probabilities for 0, 1, 2, and 4 matches by dividing our totals by 150, the total number of trials for the class (see table 5).",31,mtms2007-10-182a,,
"Thus, based on our simulation  in this example, the probability that every person will get his or her own coat is 15/150, or 1/10, or 0.1 when represented as a decimal. We can also pose this Coat-Check-problem question, “What is the probability that at least one person gets his or her own coat?” In our simulation example, the experimental probability would be the sum of the probabilities for one person getting his or her coat plus the probability that two people get their coats plus the probability that three  table 4 Simulation results for one classroom number of Matches table 6 24 ways to return the coats and correct matches 15 150 correct Matches 0 67 fig. 2).

"This investigation can be done within a class period with sixth-grade through ninth-grade students. A more challenging variation is the Coat Check problem with five coats being returned at random. To complete the simulation and list all 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1, or 120, outcomes within a class period, it works best to pair students to perform the simulations but place them in teams of five to list all ways the coats can be returned. Ask students to number off 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. The group of 1’s will list all 24 ways that begin with the number 1 and so on through the group of 5’s, which will list all 24 that begin with the number 5. Remind students to list the number of matches, in parentheses, to the right of the outcome.",81,mtms2007-10-182a,,
"When all students are finished, have  them move to different parts of the classroom so that the groups of 1’s are together, the groups of 2’s are together, and so on, so that they can compare their results. The process is made easier since listing the five-digit outcomes by size means that everyone in each new group should have the same ordered list. Next, have each group organize the data by frequency for 0, 1, 2, 3, or 5 matches. Collect the data and compile the results in a table to compute the theoretical probabilities so that they can be compared with the experimental probabilities (relative frequencies) determined by the simulations (see table 8). As part of the experience, discuss real-world applications of simulations. For example, insurance companies use actuarial science to collect accident data so as to determine policy rates.  six WoMen anD six coats",82,mtms2007-10-182a,,
"Finally, if there are six coats, there are 6! = 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1, or 720, ways to return the coats. We are forced to use simulation to approximate the probabilities. This would make a nice team project once students have experience making lists. In a class of 30 students, if each student lists 24 outcomes, then all 30 × 24, or 720, outcomes can be produced. It is left for you to devise a plan to assign each student to list his or her own set of 24 outcomes. Should you decide to try this activity, table 9 contains the theoretical probabilities.

"The NCTM’s Data Analysis and Probability Standard for Grades 6–8 mentions that “students also need to develop their probabilistic thinking by frequent experience with actual  experiments” (p. 254). Through this activity, the students I taught got an idea of what it means to simulate an experiment. It was rewarding to see how effectively students worked in teams to perform the experiment that, after pooling the data for the whole class, provided relative frequencies for estimating the probabilities for 0, 1, 2, or 4 matches (see fig. 3 for a sample of work by one pair of students).  suMMarY",84,mtms2007-10-182a,,
"The teamwork and self-checking continued with the actual listing of all 24 possible outcomes. As a class, we computed the theoretical probabilities and compared them with the relative frequencies derived from the simulation. It would have been easy to provide activity sheets for students  to complete during these exercises, but allowing students to keep track of their simulation and their listing of outcomes using their own method (with suggestions from the teacher) gave them control of their work. The importance of using a tabular form of representation is also extolled by NCTM (2000). For all groups, the excitement of engaging in a real mathematical investigation and collecting and reporting their outcomes epitomizes the type of rich experience promoted by the NCTM’s Standards.  reFerence",85,mtms2007-10-182a,,
