"This book is intended “for teachers and administrators who are committed to helping all of their students learn  mathematics and science concepts and facts” (p. xi). The book begins with a review of principles of differentiation and assessment that references several sources. The author’s ability to synthesize others’ work is the strength of the text. The remainder of the book provides several examples of instructional approaches that are based  on the readiness levels of learners:  (1) struggling, (2) typical, and  (3) gifted or highly advanced. ",14,mtms2012-04-506a,,
"Because my own view of differentiation uses a lens of experience rather than ability, I found the author’s use of these labels problematic, which may have contributed to my difficulty in finding merit in the remainder of the text. The examples of instructional approaches might be helpful for the novice teacher, but there are too many instances in which the differentiated formative assessments (DFA) do not  provide enough detail to be of use to a teacher who is not already comfortable with differentiation (e.g., “Assessment of students’ responses to the hook provides valuable information as the teacher begins the lecture. This is DFA #1,” p. 31). There is no further information to help the inexperienced teacher use this assessment in instruction. ",15,mtms2012-04-506a,,
"This book might be useful as a reference for teachers or administrators interested in sharing the theories and instructional approaches provided. However, anyone expecting concrete examples of using formative assessments to support differentiated instruction will probably be disappointed. Consequently, I cannot recommend this book.",16,mtms2012-04-506a,,
"—David Coffey Grand Valley State University Allendale, Michigan middle school. Using Balance Math would also be a fun way to introduce the idea of variables and the mechanics of solving simple linear equations. The only difficulty I have with the book is that the “rules” of the games, particularly the balance math, are not well defined. The author assumes that a circle will weigh twice what a semicircle does. However, this assumption is never clearly stated for the students. Many high school students have difficulty with geometric proofs because they make assumptions on the basis of how a figure looks rather than on statements about the figure. This small flaw could be easily remedied if the teacher provides his or her students with more explicit directions.  —H. Smith Risser",17,mtms2012-04-506a,,

"The puzzles in Balance Math and More are classified as one of three different types: balance math, insideout math, and tic tac math. All three  types of puzzles require students to reason logically to find missing values. They also reinforce basic computation skills and require students to solve systems of equations. The balance math puzzles, for instance, ask students to solve systems of equations to find the “weight” of certain shapes. Since there is no fractional computation required for the majority of the puzzles, the book would be appropriate for use with advanced students in the elementary grades or for students in early ",23,mtms2012-04-506a,,
"This eclectic compendium of select articles recently published in a variety of books and periodicals presents a synopsis of the lively, multifaceted nature of contemporary conversation on mathematics. Stimulating discussions abound on  topics ranging from cognitive bullying in the classroom, to the power and aesthetics of mathematics, to the intertwining nature of intuition, experiment, and proof. Many noted mathematicians make an appearance—some greats from earlier periods (von Neumann, Rota), as well as some contemporary stars (Gowers is a contributor, and Thurston writes a brief  foreword). Mathematical tales about famous nonmathematicians—for example, Einstein’s intellectual debt to mathematics, Valery’s mathematics addiction, and Darwin’s uneasy relationship with mathematics—add color and insight.

"Engaging Mathematics Students Using Cooperative Learning is both an instructional manual and a narrative on how cooperative learning strategies were implemented in Strebe’s classroom throughout his teaching career as a high school mathematics teacher. Strebe provides tools and  strategies for how to restructure the classroom to differentiate instruction, beginning with organizing the first day of school so as to create a teambuilding experience for all students. His passion for teaching and inspiring students is apparent throughout the book as he presents ways to engage students by encouraging peer interaction using cooperative activity sheets, interactive lectures, and collaborative test review. The book is well organized, and Strebe clearly explains the implementation and rationale of each strategy.  ",30,mtms2012-04-506a,,

At times, his descriptions become inundated with minor details; however, some readers may find his specific directions useful.

"The intended audience is middle  school students in a multicultural  classroom. The idea of introducing mathematical topics through characters that students can relate to is an excellent way to engage students in mathematics. As presented, however, my middle school students had difficulty relating to the characters because of their names (e.g., Ma$ and Queen%) and exceptionally eclectic backgrounds (e.g., Italian-KuwaitiAmerican; Ethiopian-Swedish). Other characters were completely rejected because they were described as being members of “low-income families” because students disliked such labels.",37,mtms2012-04-506a,,
"The topics of simple and compound interest were presented well in the context of banking, but the introduction of the distributive laws in the middle of the simple interest chapter seemed out of place. It significantly detracted from that chapter as it required almost an entire lesson in and of itself. Although the book contains online resources, the web address in the book is wrong, and the application recommended on interest was not functional. ",38,mtms2012-04-506a,,

Math Bafflers  bases its logic  puzzles on a format that will be familiar to anyone who has ever solved the logic problems found in newsstand magazines. The reader is given a collection of statements that individually provide tidbits of information about a problem and must piece together the facts and reach conclusions through careful deductive reasoning. ,44,mtms2012-04-506a,,
"The book situates its logic problems in mathematical contexts. In one puzzle, students must first convert inches to millimeters, centimeters, and meters, then apply this information to a logic problem that is nominally related to measurement. In another case, readers solve several simple algebra problems and then, given clues, determine which of five fictitious students solved each one. Again, the connection between the algebra and the logic problem is tenuous. ",45,mtms2012-04-506a,,
"Some students will find these  puzzles fun, but the juxtaposition of logic with mathematics that is largely irrelevant to the logic makes Math Bafflers a difficult book to recommend.
