"Students often view mathematics as a set of unrelated facts and procedures and fail to make the connections between and among related topics. One role of a teacher is to help students understand that mathematics is an interrelated discipline. Another role is to assist students in the scaffolding of their knowledge so that they can make connections between prior and current learning. When teachers structure tasks and activities that reinforce and explicitly make connections, they are preparing students to look for mathematical connections.  diagonals diagonals diagonals diagonals diagonals diagonals diagonals in polygons in polygons in polygons in polygons in polygons ll Circle a charge For all Math teachers",3,mtms2012-09-110a,,

This vision could only become a reality if mathematics educators re-examine how to reach the goal of developing mathematics for all students.

"Guiding students to make connections to previous tasks encourages them to make sense of new problems they encounter. It also increases their repertoire of mathematical strategies. In concert with the Standards for Mathematical Practice, we explicitly structured our geometry course for middle school teacher candidates to include opportunities for them to make connections between and among topics by weaving concepts and themes throughout the three units in the course. These activities can also be used with middle-grades students, with the same end goal in mind: a deeper understanding of mathematics and its connections. Much of the content we explore  during this course is basic school mathematics that our teacher candidates have experienced during their own  K–grade 12 education. For many of them, however, it is as if they are seeing the concepts for the first time. We know that in one three-credit-hour course we cannot adequately revisit all the content that our teacher candidates will encounter in their future classrooms. We have elected instead to explore topics in greater depth, with the goal of developing important “processes and proficiencies” articulated in the Standards for Mathematical Practice. We hope that our teacher candidates will seek to develop this same expertise in their future students.  inductive reasoning about interior angles",8,mtms2012-09-110a,,
"In the first unit, Inductive Reasoning: Patterns and Polygons, we investigate the properties of polygons. Exploring patterns helps instill an appreciation for the connected nature of mathematics. During this unit, students investigate two different ways to derive a generalization for finding the total number of degrees in a polygon, given  a number of sides. Before beginning this investigation, students informally prove that the sum of the measures of the interior angles of a triangle equals 180 degrees by labeling the interior angles of a triangle, tearing off each corner containing the interior angles, and arranging those angles to form a straight angle (see fig. 1). ",9,mtms2012-09-110a,,
"After this informal proof, we move to the first investigation and pose the following question and investigation:   What is the sum of the measures of the interior angles of a polygon? 1.  Draw convex polygons with   3, 4, 5, and 6 sides.  2.  Draw all the possible diagonals  from a single vertex in each polygon.",10,mtms2012-09-110a,,

"Students start the activity by discovering that it is impossible to draw any diagonals in a triangle. They also recall from the previous investigation that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180 degrees. As students continue the investigation, they realize that when they draw all the possible diagonals from a single vertex in a polygon, triangles are formed. They then complete table 1 by multiplying the number of triangles by 180 degrees (the sum of the degrees in one triangle) to determine the sum of the interior angles.",13,mtms2012-09-110a,,

"We then pose these questions: “How can you account for the difference between the last two rows of data?” and “How does your formula for interior angles in the fi rst column compare with interior angles in the second column?” After comparing their data, students discover a constant difference of 360 degrees between the fi nal two rows in the second investigation. Since students know that 360 degrees are in a circle, they can account for the extra degrees. This fi nding results from the sum of the vertex angles of the triangles surrounding the point in the interior of the polygon. However, this property is less obvious to some. ",32,mtms2012-09-110a,,
"To help students visualize the  angles, we encourage them to shade each interior angle, as in fi gure 2. This exploration also gives us an opportunity to reinforce the defi nition of an interior angle as the angle formed by two adjacent sides of the polygon. We agree that 180n – 360 represents what we discovered using only vertices of the polygon. This makes sense because n triangles are formed using a single interior point in an n-sided polygon; n triangles each contain 180 degrees, for 180n. We then subtract the 360 degrees representing the degrees that are around the point in the interior of the polygon but not interior angles of the polygon.

"The next investigation explores the exterior angles of a polygon. We are ready to begin after establishing that the exterior angle is formed by the extension of a side and the adjacent side and that one can form two congruent exterior angles at each vertex. We pose the task of fi nding the sum of one set of exterior angles for each polygon. To save time, each group will determine the sum for a specifi c polygon. Our real motive, however, is for each group to fi nd the same answer and to extend the mystery a bit.",39,mtms2012-09-110a,,
"After assigning a specifi c polygon  to each group—a triangle, a quadrilateral, a pentagon, and so on—most groups begin by using what they know about supplementary angles. They start with a special case of their polygon, either a regular polygon or a polygon where they assign values to the interior angles, so that the sum of the interior angles reﬂ ects what they discovered in the investigations. We agree that their work convinces us for that specifi c case, but we prod each group to justify how this fi nding would apply to any polygon in that category.",40,mtms2012-09-110a,,
"We visit each group and ask, “If we did not know the measure of each of the interior angles, how could you convince me that you would still get the same answer?” This answer requires a leap for students to reason ",41,mtms2012-09-110a,,

Sum of interior angles based on previous investigation = 180n – 360,44,mtms2012-09-110a,,
"Sum of (interior + exterior angles) – (interior angles) = 180n – (180n − 360) 180n – 180n + 360 = 360 mathematically. It also moves them toward justification and proof, engaging the third Standard for Mathematical Practice: “Construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others” (CCSSI 2010, pp. 6-7). With some guidance, each group is able to explain that the sum of the exterior angles plus the interior angles results in 180n. They also acknowledge that we must subtract the sum of the interior angles to determine the sum of the exterior angles. When we next gather together as a class, we discover that each group has the same answer: “360 degrees.”",45,mtms2012-09-110a,,
We then revisit the explanation  arithmetically to reiterate why the results make sense (see fig. 3). This process again requires students to enact the second Standard for Mathematical Practice and use computational operations to justify their generalization.,46,mtms2012-09-110a,,
But why is 360 so interesting? ,47,mtms2012-09-110a,,
"Again, we look at the sum of the degrees in a circle. Is this just a coincidence? Can we look at the 360 degrees in a different way? What if we start at any vertex in a polygon, take our pencil and trace along each side, and make a turn or rotation as we move to the next side when we get to a vertex? If we continue moving around the polygon, we will return to our original vertex (see fig. 4). A student’s real-life example helped underscore this notion.

"Although some students still  struggle to visualize the angles around a point as a 360 degree rotation, group reasoning prevails. Students then conclude that only regular polygons will tessellate where the interior angles are a factor of 360 degrees. Since our results are limited by our physical representations, the next question is this: Are there only three regular polygons that will tessellate the plane? ",53,mtms2012-09-110a,,
Answering this question requires that students engage the third Standard for Mathematical Practice about constructing viable arguments and critiquing the reasoning of others. ,54,mtms2012-09-110a,,
"Students use previously established results and counterexamples to justify which polygons fit the condition. They also note that it takes three hexagons to surround a point, and we need at least three polygons to surround a point to tessellate without a gap. Some students are always skeptical and need to prove to themselves that two polygons cannot surround a point. This notion is quickly dispelled when they realize that this model would require a polygon with interior angles of 180 degrees each.",55,mtms2012-09-110a,,
"When revisiting the properties of  the hexagon, students remark that each interior angle is 120 degrees. After finding each interior angle for an octagon, decagon, and dodecagon, we note that any polygon with more sides than the hexagon has interior angles that are greater than 120 degrees and would result in a product that is greater than 360 degrees. Later in the unit, we will look at semiregular polygons. We will determine that twenty-one ways are possible to surround a point using a combination of two or more regular polygons, but only eight of these polygons will result in combinations that will tessellate the plane.",56,mtms2012-09-110a,,
