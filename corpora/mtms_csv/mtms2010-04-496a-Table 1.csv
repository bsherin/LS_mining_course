"When carpenters need to construct or repair a window in an older home, they often have to make custom frames for the window. A circular window, for example, would require a custom frame. One way to produce this shape is by building a regular polygon frame (see fig. 1a) and cutting a circular frame from this polygonal frame (see fig. 1b). Carpenters use this process because regular polygons give a close approximation of a circle, which is important for two reasons: (1) wood is expensive, and this design minimizes waste; and (2) the closer the approximation, the easier it is for the carpenter to use a band saw to cut out the circle.  the following regular polygons approximate a circle: • A pentagon • A hexagon • An octagon • A 17-gon ",4,mtms2010-04-496a,,

"Geometer’s Sketchpad®, Cabri®, GeoGebra®, or any geometry software program and construct and measure the area of one circle. Next, to create a circumscribed polygon, they can use the tools found in most geometry software programs (the premade tool bar from Sketchpad is shown in fig. 1). ",11,mtms2010-04-496a,,
"To complete this task, students— 1.  select the polygon they want to  make from those found in the menu;  2.  click on the center of the circle;  3.  Students should notice that the more  and sides a polygon has, the better it will approximate the area of a circle, regardless of the radius of the circle.  3.  drag the polygon out until its edge  is on the circumference of the circle.
