"One important key to a student’s success in math is being able to communicate mathematically. To do so, students need to develop a language for expressing mathematical ideas (NCTM 2000). Writing is a good communication tool because it—  beats and rhyme with one another, and lines 3 and 4 have two such beats and rhyme. We provided examples of general limericks as well as math limericks (see fig. 1). ",3,mtms2010-03-378a,,
We then explained haiku poems. The following definition was given: ,4,mtms2010-03-378a,,
"A conventional haiku is a poem of seventeen syllables that are arranged in three lines. The first and third lines contain five syllables, and the second line has seven syllables (5, 7, 5). The haiku is the shortest form of Japanese poetry and often focuses on themes related to nature, feelings, or experiences. Haiku poems seldom have titles. ",5,mtms2010-03-378a,,
We noted that haiku poems typically do not rhyme. We then explored both general and mathematical haikus (fig. 2).,6,mtms2010-03-378a,,
"For the next phase of our lesson, students were asked to create their own math haiku or limerick; an accompanying illustration was optional. Students quickly began working. Most began by writing the math concept they intended to use as their poem’s topic, establishing key terms, looking for rhyming words (for limericks) or syllable agreement (for the haiku), and writing their first draft. A few students said they could not find anything to write about, so we helped them brainstorm concepts that they found interesting. After about  1.  allows students to express their understanding in a less public forum; and  2.  helps students refine their thinking  because they must reflect on and clarify their ideas (NCTM 2000). ",7,mtms2010-03-378a,,
"For these reasons, students should engage in writing activities in math class (Ward 2005).",8,mtms2010-03-378a,,
"To encourage writing, we designed and taught a lesson in which middlegrades students were asked to write a mathematical poem. We chose two types of poetry—the limerick and haiku—to discuss because they involve specific patterns that are based on numbers of syllables and rhythms. The students were instructed to pick any math concept and use it to create their own original poem. ",9,mtms2010-03-378a,,

"This lesson was implemented in a fifth-grade and a seventh-grade classroom after we discussed the format of a limerick and haiku. We explained that a limerick is a five-line poem with a rhyming pattern of a-a-b-b-a. Lines 1, 2, and 5 contain three heavy  ten minutes, one student who had finished his poem read it to the class, which encouraged the others to keep working. We waited for about eight more minutes to ensure that most students had finished their work. We then asked volunteers to read their poems and asked the class to describe the meanings of the poems and their intended messages. We ended the class by distributing a feedback form and gave students about five minutes to provide input on the lesson.",12,mtms2010-03-378a,,
PoeMs and coMMents,13,mtms2010-03-378a,,
"When students were first told that they would be authoring their own mathematical limericks and haikus, some were skeptical about their writing ability. Some found it hard to simply begin writing. “Making a poem from scratch was difficult,” penned one student. This makes sense, given that students are used to reading poems written by others rather than creating their own. In addition, these poems had both formatting and topic constraints.",14,mtms2010-03-378a,,
"But once students got started, they were all engaged in the activity. They began by writing their ideas in sentence form and then looking for synonyms and words that would convey their ideas while satisfying the guidelines for the specific poetry forms under consideration. After determining the words they needed, students wrote (and some illustrated) their poems. One student numbered each line with the number of syllables needed for each, presumably to stay on track or use as a self-check. Although many students drew on geometry or measurement elements for their poems, the topics ranged across various areas of mathematics, including algebra and number and operations. Sample student work appears in figures 3 and 4. ",15,mtms2010-03-378a,,

"Some students’ poems were not  technically correct in that they did not  contain the exact number of syllables typical of that poetry form. This may indicate that these students were  either challenged by this task or did not pay attention to detail. It would have been useful to have students review each other’s work in pairs or small groups to provide feedback on verbal clarity, mathematical and  technical accuracy, and appropriateness of illustrations when used.",35,mtms2010-03-378a,,

closing thoughts,41,mtms2010-03-378a,,
"Linking mathematics with poetry seems to hold much promise for enriching the teaching and learning of mathematics (Franco 2006; Whitin and Piwko 2008). Asking students to write their own mathematical poems “takes math out of its box and makes it whimsical and creative” (Franco 2006, p. 17). The poems used can be longer and less constrained than those used here, but any type of poem can be a springboard for good discussion or further exploration. ",42,mtms2010-03-378a,,
"As an extension to this lesson, students could be asked to write a mathematical poem of a form other than the haiku or the limerick. Students could also be allowed more time to revise their poems. As noted earlier, they could work in pairs or small groups to share their thoughts and provide feedback on one another’s poems and use this input for  further revision. Final poems might be published in a class or school newsletter or booklet. Students might also write some mathematics questions to accompany their poems to encourage further thinking, exploration, and discussion.",43,mtms2010-03-378a,,
"Many of the ideas and concepts in  mathematics are abstract or symbolic in nature. For that reason, using literature in math class allows ideas and concepts to be described within the context of a story, and informal language and descriptive pictures can be used to further students’ understanding. ",44,mtms2010-03-378a,,
"For example, most of the students described in this article demonstrated a grasp of a mathematics concept that they were able to express in poetic form, using language that made sense ",45,mtms2010-03-378a,,

"(a) (b) (c) to them. Although the poems included some misspellings, we believe that allowing students to express their ideas in writing freely, at least on initial drafts, builds confidence and focuses attention appropriately on the mathematical ideas. Mathematics activities stimulated by literature can inspire students to explore and investigate mathematics concepts more actively while fostering the realization that mathematics abounds in the world around us. Literature can make  mathematics learning more engaging and less intimidating.",47,mtms2010-03-378a,,
