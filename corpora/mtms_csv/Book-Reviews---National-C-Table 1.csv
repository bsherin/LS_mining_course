Windschitl. 129 pp., $29.95 paper. ISBN 9780873537452. Stock no. 14576. National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,  copublished with NSTA Press;  www.nctm.org.",,

8,Book Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"This book guides teachers through a step-by-step process, starting with setting clear learning goals; identifying tasks that are consistent with those goals; engaging the 5 practices in discussion; and followed by describing how to change a question, how to allow access, and how to challenge student thinking, thereby promoting whole-class participation with focused talk.",,
9,Book Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,The 5 practices described are the following: (1) anticipate how students will respond; (2) monitor what students do; (3) select students to present during discussion; (4) sequence student strategies to increase learning in discussion; and (5) connect students responses to learning goals and the bigger picture in science.,,
10,Book Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,I used the 5 practices to format my class discussion and change my traditional questioning. This process focused discussion on the learning goals and gave my underrepresented students a voice that was previously absent.,,
11,Book Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,This book is a great tool that can be used to grow classroom discussions and deepen student learning through whole-class discourse.,,

17,Book Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Uncomplicating Fractions to Meet  Common Core Standards in Math, K7 does exactly what it promises. Marian Small does a wonderful job of uncomplicating a students study of fractions, starting at grade 1 and ending at grade 7, for both the student and the teacher. The method of explaining the study of fractions breaks it down both conceptually as well as procedurally. The author clearly explains what students need to understand and exactly how to best present the ideas to them.",,
18,Book Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Small begins by describing the books organization. Each section clearly breaks down the standards by grade level. She then explains exactly how she approaches the organization of each section, defining each standard and supplying background information on the important underlying ideas. She continues by discussing questions to ask and then summarizing the entire standard. She also describes the appropriate manipulatives that can be used as well as ideas for differentiation.",,
19,Book Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I have experience teaching special education, middle school math, both in resource as well as in inclusion classrooms. Fractions are a difficult hurdle for all students, not just those who are in the lower reaches of math. This book does an excellent job of reinforcing methods I am already using in the classroom as well as giving many new approaches. I highly recommend this book for anyone trying to face the difficult task of getting students to understand fractions.",,

28,Book Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Many of the items illustrated and discussed can be found on the Internet for free, such as page 39s Once Upon a Time. We are now using the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics; however, the materials to be taught are on the upper levels of Blooms taxonomy. On page 25, one reads, Each student must write a  lesson plan, present the lesson and  assign homework. There is not enough time for students to give a lesson with the depth of knowledge required. Page 29s method, Show topics before teaching and let students hold up fingers to denote familiarity with topic, is common to Number Talks strategies.",,
29,Book Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"One plus is that the author promotes math writing. In I Am a Geometric Figure, he describes ways for students to do presentations with rubrics. However, the levels of the rubric categories are missing. Another plus is that some of the exercises are interdisciplinary, such as Game Time and CricketsNatures Thermometer. Linguini Lines, however, is the only new activity for me.",,

38,Book Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"This highly organized and structured book builds gradually, from an introduction to number sense up to algebra and other early high school topics. The authors have created a comprehensive textbook that covers every standard math topic in grades 19. If you are a professor who is responsible for preparing preservice teachers for the K12 classrooms, then I give this book my highest recommendation.",,
39,Book Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"It is not sufficiently detailed to serve as an independent study text. Rather, it is a great tool to use in conjunction with expert facilitation. Teachers who have read the examples and completed the sample problems under the supervision of an excellent professor will be equipped to help their students learn mathematics well.",,
40,Book Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I believe that when used with undergraduate education majors, this book will be an important addition to the literature.",,

47,Book Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
48,Book Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"For me, the greatest strength of the book is that it is written in a very approachable and practical way. It takes much of what has already been written about the need for mathematical understanding and puts it into a form that will be helpful for those who wish to teach in this manner. Another strength is that the book offers prompts throughout that teachers can use, for example, when conferring and when students are stuck.",,
49,Book Reviews - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,I highly recommend this book for practitioners of mathematics in the middle grades. I think it would also work particularly well as a book club offering for math teachers who are making the shift from a more traditional math classroom to an investigative math classroom.,,
