"6. Note that at the end of year 2, the  cost per cup drops by 1/2 from the cost at the end of year 1. Use a fraction to answer each of the following:   a.  At the end of year 3, the cost per cup drops by what fraction from the end of year 2?   b.  At the end of year 4, the cost per cup drops by what fraction from the end of year 3? 7. Use a pattern and fractions to  make the following predictions:    a.  At the end of year 5, the cost per cup drops by what fraction from the end of year 4? 2. To reduce the price to $0.50 per cup, how many cups would you have to squeeze out of this deal? 3. A lemonade stand down the street offers the same sort of “all you can drink” pricing for just $6.25. Red’s deal costs how many times as much as the deal down the street?  4. a.  Able said that $50.00 is 8  times as much as $6.25; Gable said that $50.00 is 8 times more than $6.25; Mable said that $56.25 is 8 times more than $6.25. Who is correct?

solUtions 1. $50.00 ÷ 4 = $12.50 per cup 2.  $50.00 ÷ $0.50 = 100. You would need to drink 100 cups. Students may also reason that 100 × $0.50 = $50.00.,9,mtms2012-09-80a,,
3.  $50.00 ÷ $6.25 = 8. Red’s lemonade stand charges 8 times as much as the one down the street.,10,mtms2012-09-80a,,
4.  a.  Able and Mable are correct. ,11,mtms2012-09-80a,,
"Sample answer: Gable is incorrect because $50.00 is 8 times as much as (not 8 times more than) $6.25 (8 × $6.25 = $50.00). So  the amount that is 8 times more than $6.25 is 8($6.25) + $6.25 = $50.00 + $6.25, or $56.25, which is why Mable is correct.",12,mtms2012-09-80a,,
  b.  Ben and Fen are correct.  ,13,mtms2012-09-80a,,
"Ben is correct because the base is $6.25, so each “unit of  100 percent” is equal to $6.25.  Thus, $6.25 is 100 percent of $6.25, $12.50 is 200 percent  of $6.25, $18.75 is 300 percent of $6.25, . . . , and $50.00 is  800 percent of $6.25. Fen is correct because 700 percent of $6.25 = $43.75, so 700 percent more than $6.25 = $43.75 + $6.25, or $50.00. Jen is perhaps  confusing the situation with a price reduction. Clearly, a price cannot decrease by more than 100 percent.  5. Number of Years",14,mtms2012-09-80a,,

"Our classes studied unit rate extensively earlier in the school year, so I presented this lesson as a review. The cartoon was an attention-getter. Most students were initially shocked by the lemonade price but then realized it might be a pretty good deal after all.",23,mtms2012-09-80a,,
"Most students answered question  1 (the unit price for 4 cups) in the same way, but question 2 (How many cups would create a unit price of $0.50?) led to a wide range of solution strategies. The follow-up questions helped students reflect on their problem-solving strategies and the meaning of division.",24,mtms2012-09-80a,,
"Once students understood the concept of the cartoon (a lifetime supply of lemonade for $50.00), we discussed whether that was a reasonable offer. I asked if they would buy such a plan or make such an offer. As an extension, I then asked students to consider their local Starbucks coffee shop and what price would be appropriate for all-you-can-drink coffee. This led to some rich discussions and creative answers. Some students suggested tiered pricing based on how often a customer visits or even the customer’s expected life span.",25,mtms2012-09-80a,,

"My seventh graders worked in groups of four and enjoyed this cartoon. It was fun to watch them struggle with the first question as they tried to decide what was being asked of them. They wanted to simply answer $50.00 because they decided that, since the $50.00 had to be paid anyway, it did not matter how much each cup cost. The cartoon elicited a fruitful discussion about economics that also reminded them how important it is to be a critical reader. We worked on the “800 percent of ” and “700 percent more than” questions together. Once  they had a little more information, they were quick to reach the aha! moment. ",29,mtms2012-09-80a,,
"Overall, it was great for students to look more critically at the concept of division and the different reasons for it (see the Other Ideas section below). What initially looked like a rather easy, straightforward task ended up requiring them to really think about what they were doing. ",30,mtms2012-09-80a,,

"My students had studied decimals and fractions in the previous nine weeks before this cartoon activity was assigned. It was completed as a review at the beginning of the third set of nine weeks to see what was retained over the winter break. Students did not have many questions about the assignment and worked diligently on the problems. They got a bit confused when answering the challenge questions and needed a little guidance from me. I did a quick mini-reteach lesson and reminded the students of math strategies that they could use to help complete the table and solve the problems. They used various strategies and, for the most part, were very successful with their efforts. ",34,mtms2012-09-80a,,
"As an extra-credit option, we  extended the idea. I gave my students an example of a pair of shoes or boots that were quite costly. If I wore the shoes only once and the heel broke, how expensive were my shoes? If I wore them a moderate number of times and the heel broke, how much did they then cost per wear? If I wore the boots every day throughout the colder months of November, December, January, and February for one year, how much did the boots cost me when the heel broke? How much were my boots after two years of wearing them during those same cold-weather months? This extension  added another layer to the lesson, and the students started thinking of realworld math problems of their own to use in conjunction with this activity. They also challenged their review partners with “what if you had this . . .” questions. It was engaging, meaningful, and fun for them.",35,mtms2012-09-80a,,
"The next time I assign this activity, ",36,mtms2012-09-80a,,
I will use it in the middle or at the end of the second set of nine weeks so that the rules of working with fractions and decimals are still fresh in the minds of the students.,37,mtms2012-09-80a,,
