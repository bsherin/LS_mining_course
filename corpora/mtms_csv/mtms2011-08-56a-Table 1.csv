"A physical balance scale can be a useful tool to help students understand the concept of balancing equations. However, some students may have misconceptions about the concept of balance even when using a physical model, focusing on the amount of weight only and ignoring the placement of the weight. Although most students at some point in their lives have been on a teeter-totter or seesaw, they rarely connect those playground objects with the mathematical principles involved in using a simple tool such as a lever.",3,mtms2011-08-56a,,
"Sometimes the simplest manipulatives make the biggest impression, a fact I experienced during a professional development session geared toward lower-grades mathematics. I became intrigued when asked to make a rudimentary balance scale from recycled and common household items. While the simple mathematical activities unfolded, I became excited about the balance scale’s potential to be used to explore middle grades number concepts. Since that workshop, I have used physical balance scales while working with several groups of middle level students. Using the scale has helped them gain a concrete understanding of balancing algebraic equations as well as other mathematics concepts. ",4,mtms2011-08-56a,,

"This lesson explores number concepts, such as the commutative and distributive properties, order of operations, equalities, inequalities, and proportion through concrete models. Students also gain experience in writing numeric and symbolic representations of those concepts. The understanding and use of multiple representations has become an important aspect of teaching introductory algebra (NCTM 2000). Knuth et al. (2008) also showed that students’ understanding of equivalence, especially the meaning of the equals sign, has a direct relationship to students’ understanding of algebraic equations. Tent (2006) found that mastering the properties of arithmetic helps students succeed in algebra. The balance scale provides students with kinesthetic and visual representations of balance—opportunities that are sometimes overlooked or ignored in mathematics’ classrooms.",6,mtms2011-08-56a,,
"FiRst, a PRetest",7,mtms2011-08-56a,,
"Before starting the activity, I preassess students, which provides information about their interpretations of a balance scale and their understanding of the equals sign and equations (see activity sheet 1). The pretest asks students to interpret visual representations of a balance scale by labeling the pictures as balanced, tilted left, or tilted right and to provide a written explanation of their answer. Their responses can be brief, such as “same number of weights” or “weights are farther out on the left side.” getting staRted",8,mtms2011-08-56a,,
Creating the Balance Scale,9,mtms2011-08-56a,,
"Commercial versions of balance scales are available, but I have found that students are more engaged when they can make their own scale from recycled materials. I show students a model of the balance scale that they will make and then put it on display. Making the scale will take approximately twenty minutes. (See the sidebar.)",10,mtms2011-08-56a,,
Discussing the Balance Scale  in Real-World Terms,11,mtms2011-08-56a,,
"To help students think about balancing their scale, prompt them to describe their experiences with teetertotters or seesaws. Then ask them to visualize paper clips being balanced instead of people on a teeter-totter. Emphasize that the numbers above the paper clip indicate the distance from the center of the balance scale, such as 1 inch, 2 inches, and so on. This step helps students add the “inch” label to the number. Avoid long strings of paper clips, as there could be interference from the bottle or table, which would affect the weight distribution on the lever. Students should hang multiple paper clips from a position hole or hang all additional paper clips on the first paper clip hanging from a position hole.",12,mtms2011-08-56a,,
"Focusing inquiRies During the inquiry, students work in pairs or in small groups to develop their understanding of equivalence by analyzing equations and number properties (see table 1). I encourage students to verbalize their understandings and write solutions  instructions for building a balance scale",13,mtms2011-08-56a,,

"5. Put the cardboard strip aside. To make the fulcrum of the balance, tear off a piece of masking tape about the length of the clothespin, then tear that strip in half. fold one piece of tape over each end of the clothespin, but leave about a fingertip’s length of tape extending past the end of the clothespin. Pinch the tape flat.  6. Cut a narrow V in the center of the tape on both sides down to the wood. This creates a notch on which to rest the dress pin as it protrudes from the cardboard strip. The notch needs to be wide enough for the pin to move freely but not too wide or it will be difficult to keep the balance level.",15,mtms2011-08-56a,,
"7. Clamp the clothespin onto the pull tab of a drink can or to the mouth of a beverage bottle. Balance the cardboard strip between the ears of the clothespin, using the dressmaker’s pin as the pivot point. The cardboard strip should not rub against the clothespin ears or the spring. You may need to move the pivot point placement if the lever does not swing freely. if the balance does not sit straight across, you may add small sections of tape to the higher or lighter end of the cardboard strip so that the scale will be balanced.  8. Ask students to put their names on their scales, since the scales will be stored in the classroom. Make sure students rebalance their scales each day and work on a level surface.  3.

Mark the center of the 1 1/2 × 11 cardboard strip or lever. Do not fold the strip, as it will not pivot freely. Mark a dot 5 1/2 inches from one long end of the strip and about 1 inch from the top edge. This dot marks the fulcrum, or pivot point, of the balance scale. Draw a straight line about 1/2 inch from the short edge all the way across the 11-inch length of the cardboard strip. On the line you drew, mark each inch outward on both the left-hand side and the right-hand side (see the photograph below). The mark at each inch will look like a plus sign.  2. label the plus-sign marks from  left to right as 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0,  1, 2, 3, 4, 5.  3. Punch holes at each plus-sign mark along the line (except 0), keeping the + mark in the middle of the punched circle. Carefully punch the holes at even intervals. (Prepunch several strips for special-needs students and to have extras available for those who are absent.)  table 1 Paper-clip explorations can help clarify the differences found among number properties.",16,mtms2011-08-56a,,

Possible Misconceptions,22,mtms2011-08-56a,,
"Students may think the balance scale uses an additive rule, which is one of several reasons that students make mistakes on the pretest. For example, figure 1 shows a balance scale that is frequently considered balanced if students sum the number of the location of the paper clips and how many paper clips are used on each side. In this example, 2 + 3 would balance 4 + 1. However, when correctly applying the multiplicative rule demonstrated by the balance scale, the balance actually tilts to the left because 2 × 3 > 1 × 4.",23,mtms2011-08-56a,,

Fig. 1 This balance scale illustrates an additive problem.,26,mtms2011-08-56a,,
"for students to concretely explore with the balance scale. The model of the expression 2 × 4 (2 paper clips hanging from the 4) looks different than 4 × 2 (4 paper clips hanging from the 2); however, they are in balance. One important reason to use the balance scale is the visual representation of the distributive property of multiplication. When students solve distributive problems, they need to understand where the number and position of the paper clips appear in the numerical representation.",27,mtms2011-08-56a,,
"It is best if students identify and  label the numbers in distributive problems to relate to either distance or weight. Students should think of the first number as representing how many  paper clips and the second number as representing the location of the paper clips. For example, the equation  5 × 2 = 2(2 + 3) means that 5 paper clips are located at 2 inches balancing 2 paper clips hanging at both 2 inches and 3 inches. Although the examples provided in table 1 use only two sets of paper clips, I encourage students to develop more complex problems.",28,mtms2011-08-56a,,
"extensions The cards in figure 2 provide specific scenarios. Ask students to find and record several solutions to those scenarios, because such questions promote mathematical reasoning and communication skills. Students should verbally explain the visual representation, write numerical equations, and be able to explain what the numbers in each equation represent. ",29,mtms2011-08-56a,,
"Students can test the idea of a variable using a balance scale during explorations of the distributive property. For example, offer the equation  b(3 + 4) = b × 3 + b × 4 ",30,mtms2011-08-56a,,

"If the number substituted into the  variable in the equation is the same on both sides, students should be able to explain why the scale balances, no matter what is the value of b. Mathematics teachers may need to discuss the meaning of concatenation, which is the concept that a letter next to a letter (ab) or a number next to a letter (3b) is the symbolic way of writing multiplication in algebra. ",34,mtms2011-08-56a,,
Another way to promote students’  mathematical thinking is to work through order-of-operations problems during exercises exploring inequalities. This is an excellent way to reinforce the correct placement of parentheses. Using a balance scale helps students discover misunderstandings in how they interpret numerical representations in equations and expressions.  evaluation,35,mtms2011-08-56a,,
"After students have explored, explained, and extended their studies of number properties and concepts using a balance scale, they should complete a posttest (see the appendix, which is appended to the online version of this article at www.nctm.org/mtms). Several open-ended questions are included so that students can explain why the scale will balance or tip, which will be important in evaluating their conceptual knowledge. A section on the fi nal evaluation will again ask students to provide a defi nition and meaning for the equal sign in light of their explorations of the balance sale. ",36,mtms2011-08-56a,,
"In addition to pencil-and-paper  tasks, assessments conducted through individual student interviews or in large-group discussions are also appropriate.
