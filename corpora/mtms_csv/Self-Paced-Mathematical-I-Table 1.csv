8,Self-Paced Mathematical Instruction,"Participation at various 1:1 conferences allows teachers the opportunity to interact with others and ask for help concerning implementation. Teachers’ comments and questions are often directed toward understanding how 1:1 can assist their students in the mathematical learning process,  not the technological logistics of a 1:1 classroom.

11,Self-Paced Mathematical Instruction,"A self-paced classroom is a fl uid, mathematical experience for all levels  of students, where mathematical improvement over time is the main focus. Concepts, instruction, explorations, activities, assessments, and projects are all set up in advance (often for a full calendar year) in a common area on the Internet, usually at a teachercreated website, or by using a curriculum container. Students are assessed before a unit begins to explore specifi c content understanding. Units are then broken into sections, so that students can accelerate from one section of a unit to the pieces that remain. For example, in a sixth-grade unit dealing with integers (sites.google.com/ site/6thgradeintegerunit), some students may already be capable of showing their understanding of positive and negative integers, depicting where the integers are sequenced on a number ",11,Self-Paced Mathematical Instruction

The possibility exists that an entire unit could be dismissed and that the student could be promoted to the culminating project for that unit. At any point during the period, the class may have multiple units in process simultaneously. ",22,Self-Paced Mathematical Instruction
23,Self-Paced Mathematical Instruction,"The instruction in a 1:1 environment does not emphasize a teacher-led approach. Instead, students can work alone or can choose to collaborate. This interaction between students is where most of the understanding occurs. Technology gives students access to videos, manipulatives, and websites  to help them better understand the content. ",23,Self-Paced Mathematical Instruction
24,Self-Paced Mathematical Instruction,"The teacher acts as a facilitator, walking around the room, listening to conversations, offering follow-up questions, and interjecting help when necessary. If a student is struggling with a concept, peers are called on for a signifi cant student-to-student conversation rather than a teacher-to-student conversation. This scenario is modeled in class by having students sit next to one another, thereby emphasizing collaboration on the solution instead of the teacher giving the answer. Overall, allowing students to have these fl exible arrangements puts the onus on the students being responsible for their own learning and understanding. ",24,Self-Paced Mathematical Instruction

29,Self-Paced Mathematical Instruction,"A self-paced classroom presents opportunities that the standard classroom setup cannot. One of the most positive aspects is the ability for students to truly work at their own rate (Oliver, Kellogg, and Patel 2010; Serhan 2010). A study analyzing the differences between a traditional classroom and online alternatives found that students considered selfpacing to be the number one positive result from using technology in the classroom (Edwards and Rule 2013). ",29,Self-Paced Mathematical Instruction
30,Self-Paced Mathematical Instruction,"With units posted in advance,  students who demonstrate understanding from preassessments do not have to wait for others to master the same concepts; they can move ahead freely. This pacing also benefi ts students who do not necessarily possess previous understanding but who can process much faster than other peers. Two of the most common problems described  by parents and students are boredom and a lack of motivation. Giving these students the knowledge that others will not hinder their advancement often pushes their limits and entices their thirst for learning. ",30,Self-Paced Mathematical Instruction
31,Self-Paced Mathematical Instruction,"This self-pacing concept also  works well for students who typically struggle with mathematics. Each year, students fall behind because of the speed of instruction and are caught in an endless game of trying to catch up. Mathematics concepts build on one another. If one specific concept is not fully understood, it is possible that these students will lag behind because future instruction will not be comprehended, thereby widening the learning gap between students. Presenting prerecorded videos for instruction allows students to learn about concepts and go back to view content that they did not initially understand. Teachers  can now work one on one with struggling students because the class time is seldom used to address the students as a whole group. ",31,Self-Paced Mathematical Instruction
32,Self-Paced Mathematical Instruction,Collaboration,32,Self-Paced Mathematical Instruction
33,Self-Paced Mathematical Instruction,"Collaboration between and among peers is essential for success in this environment. Students are free to alter the seating of the classroom at any time to discuss concepts in depth, find someone who is working ahead who can assist in learning, and either remain with the same peers throughout the year or switch when the students feel it is appropriate. The teacher is also vital to discussion efforts. Because teachers are not tied to whole-class instruction, they can focus instead on the needs of an individual student or groups of students. This newfound flexibility sets the self-paced classroom apart from traditional instruction. ",33,Self-Paced Mathematical Instruction
34,Self-Paced Mathematical Instruction,"Questions can be asked to further the students’ understanding or move the instruction in the correct direction. For example, during the integer unit, I may challenge students to ponder what using halves and fourths looks like on a coordinate plane. To help a struggling student with the concept of distance on a number line, I may suggest a few similar situations (making the x-coordinate a constant number) to help the student recognize a pattern.

49,Self-Paced Mathematical Instruction,"If the school offers an accelerated  math program and multiple assessment sources suggest that a student may qualify, the remainder of the school year can be spent preparing the student for that advancement. If the progression includes omitting complete grade levels, self-pacing can provide a perfect opportunity to work on what may be skipped as a result of the acceleration process. ",49,Self-Paced Mathematical Instruction
50,Self-Paced Mathematical Instruction,"One advantage of this new fl ex- ibility is that the teacher can modify or add to the curriculum depending on the needs of the students. If the teacher has an activity or project that will interest one or a group of students because it is related to both an interest area and a mathematical concept, the teacher can implement that project with these students. He or she can then continue with the prepared units after the project is complete. The overall plan can also be altered for struggling students. Additional practice can be inserted into the curriculum to give these students a different approach to a concept that they have yet to master. ",50,Self-Paced Mathematical Instruction
51,Self-Paced Mathematical Instruction,"Although each school’s special education design may look slightly different, a self-paced environment can benefi t any situation. The special education teachers and aides are often spread thin among students. Fortunately, many special needs students only require occasional assurance and support. The instruction established ahead of time allows the teacher the freedom to walk around the classroom, providing additional support for these  students. Special needs students also get support from peers. The self-pacing allows for the additional time they might require to succeed by rewatching instruction without feeling rushed. The special education teacher or aide can focus on the one or two students who require more support, and he or she can provide constant one-on-one attention, leading to a more focused approach and success for those students as well. ",51,Self-Paced Mathematical Instruction
52,Self-Paced Mathematical Instruction,Feedback and Homework,52,Self-Paced Mathematical Instruction
53,Self-Paced Mathematical Instruction,"In many traditional classroom settings, students are assigned work, which is assessed the following day. Much of the period is spent reviewing answers to the assignment. The students who will have completed the assignment thoughtfully may be forced to spend time participating even though mastery has been achieved. Other students may not have fi nished the assignment or may have completed it with little thought. The analysis in class only benefi ts the students who fi nished the entire homework assignment and required feedback. The time that is monopolized by going over a homework assignment fails to match the number of students impacted by this classroom practice. ",53,Self-Paced Mathematical Instruction
54,Self-Paced Mathematical Instruction,"In the self-paced model, most of  the homework is done in class or during the school hours, allowing students maximum support. The teacher is able to give feedback in class, and any assignments (partially done or completed) are submitted for assessment and feedback. When students  arrive the next day, they immediately know whether they are on the right track because the feedback is detailed. If it is clear that a student does not understand the concept, the self-paced environment allows the teacher to confer individually with him or her while others progress on their own or in groups. The immediate feedback motivates students to keep moving through the material, thus giving them a sense of direction. ",54,Self-Paced Mathematical Instruction
55,Self-Paced Mathematical Instruction,"After-school hours are spent writing and typing feedback on assignments that students complete each day. The responses are specifi c to each student. Time is spent pinpointing misunderstandings and providing explanations so that each student can problem solve the remainder of the dilemma by himself or herself. If no feedback is needed because the concept is clear, questions are posed for the student to ponder before moving on. Finally, because students are able  to access the instruction and resources on their own, the teacher can talk with each student or group of students at a back table without interrupting the rest of the class. This type of feedback and additional instruction are useful elements for students who are still struggling with a concept. This discussion with individual students can help fi ll gaps in understanding. ",55,Self-Paced Mathematical Instruction
56,Self-Paced Mathematical Instruction,Assessment,56,Self-Paced Mathematical Instruction
57,Self-Paced Mathematical Instruction,"The entire self-paced process is a formative assessment. Students continuously demonstrate understanding of certain standards or benchmarks through the various tasks asked of them. Through instructor feedback and discussion with the students, changes or additional practice can be added to the progression if a student has not demonstrated profi ciency. Instruction does not need to be stopped to check every student at an identical time. ",57,Self-Paced Mathematical Instruction
58,Self-Paced Mathematical Instruction,"Summative assessments are in two  forms. First, an assessment identical  to the preassessment is given to the students. Although this is technically a summative assessment, the results are used to determine if a student needs additional support on any of the individual sections. In addition to the final assessment, a project or task is given to encompass all the standards in a given unit. Students are expected to perform at a high level on these summative assessments because they have already shown understanding in the multiple formative assessments during the selfpaced process.  coMMon conceRns to  selF-Paced instRUction",58,Self-Paced Mathematical Instruction

61,Self-Paced Mathematical Instruction,Self-paced learning permits more  involvement in a student’s mathematical experience while allowing the classroom to be student centered.

62,Self-Paced Mathematical Instruction,"The notion of developing meaningful teacher-student relationships can often get lost within the implementation of technology but might be the most important aspect to an effective venture into self-pacing. Truthfully, self-pacing can present opportunities for a student to work below his or her  capability level. With a computer at a student’s fingertips, multiple off-task options are available. To alleviate this concern, expectations must be set and conveyed to all students, who in turn must trust the instructor enough to accept that these expectations will help them succeed.

Additional time outside of school hours is set aside to help any students who were unable to attend earlier in the day and to plan for future classes.
