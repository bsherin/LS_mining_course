These designs are called kolams and are considered a sign of welcome to the house, especially the goddess of wealth. ",4,Mathematics on Thresholds: Kolams
5,Mathematics on Thresholds: Kolams,"Different mathematicians have  classiﬁ ed kolams into various categories using different structures. Kolams can be drawn as curves and loops around a grid of dots following a certain pattern (pulli kolam or neli kolam), or drawn as lines and curves through the dots forming a tiled image (tessellated kolams). These categories of kolams have line symmetries, rotational symmetries, and point symmetries. For example, transformations of rectangular kolams include rotations through 90, 180, 270, and 360 degrees (see ﬁ g. 1).",5,Mathematics on Thresholds: Kolams

29,Mathematics on Thresholds: Kolams,"More than seventy years of research point to the importance of teaching  mathematics for understanding. Successful students actively construct understanding rather than passively receive knowledge. Implications of this fundamental lesson from research are explored in different ways through twenty-four chapters presented in this book. Chapters cover investigations of a wide range of topics, approaches, and settings, and mathematics teachers at all levels will ﬁ nd examples of research that are relevant to the challenges they face.",29,Mathematics on Thresholds: Kolams
