"Developing Spatial Sense and Communication Skills dDo you find that your students sometimes struggle when communicating their mathematical ideas? Do you believe that developing good spatial sense is important in the mathematics classroom? To jump-start a mathematical conversation among you and your students, complete this exercise: Glance at figure 1a for no longer than three seconds, then draw what you saw. When you are done, look at the image and compare it with your drawing. What did you see? How did you draw it? Ask a colleague to do the same. Did he or she draw the diagram differently? How did you describe the ",0,mtms2008-09-101a,,

"The NCTM encourages educators to link standards rather than focus on one standard at a time. The Content Standards and the Process Standards work hand in hand. For example, the Number and Operations Standard describes the expectations of developing number sense, making reasonable estimates, and using number knowledge in solving problems (NCTM 2000). The Geometry Standard asks that students use visualization, spatial reasoning, and geometric knowledge to solve problems. The Measurement Standard calls for students to understand measurable attributes and apply appropriate techniques and tools to determine measurement (NCTM 2000). All these goals are greatly enhanced by the use of spatial sense. Communication, a Process Standard, explores the importance of students’ being able to explain the process in mathematical terms (NCTM 2000). In this article, we discuss how we  incorporated a spatial activity into our preservice teacher education program. Our approach was to work with preservice teachers to enhance their spatial reasoning both in their education classes and as they worked with a middle-grades student on similar tasks. Our goal in this article is not only to encourage the incorporation of more spatial activities into the middle-grades curriculum but also to encourage spatial instruction with preservice teachers. It is important for them to experience spatial tasks for themselves and then practice implementing the tasks with middlegrades students. However, this article discusses the need for all teachers and students to develop spatial sense and communication skills.",3,mtms2008-09-101a,,

"One goal in both elementary and middle-grades mathematics methods classes is to improve preservice teachers’ abilities to communicate mathematically. To achieve this goal, we use Quick Draw (Wheatley 2007), a spatial-visualization activity. Participants are shown a geometric figure, displayed using an overhead projector or document camera, for three seconds. They are then asked to draw on unlined paper what they saw. After the drawings are complete, the image is then displayed and discussed. “Quick Draw is designed to develop powerful mental imagery that will come into play in both numerical ",5,mtms2008-09-101a,,

"Our mathematics methods classes meet once a week and begin each class by presenting Quick Draw images. Each image is part of a series of two, with similarities between each. The images become more complex as the semester progresses and as the preservice teachers’ spatial sense improves. Figure 2 is an example of a series. After our Quick Draw activity, we review preservice teachers’ field experiences (they spend ten hours per week in the schools), discuss assignments from the previous week (articles read, lessons taught), and work on problem-solving activities that relate to the middle-grades curriculum. We find that encouraging our preservice teachers to exercise their spatial abilities at the beginning of each class is an excellent way to then continue to build on a topic through mathematical conversations.",8,mtms2008-09-101a,,

We believe that linking communication and spatial abilities in methods classes will help preservice teachers do the same in their future work with students. ",11,mtms2008-09-101a,,
"During the Quick Draw activity, our preservice teachers vary both in how they draw and interpret the figures. This diversity creates a classroom environment in which communicating mathematically becomes a regular  occurrence. As the semester progresses and more complex figures are used, communication occurs at deeper levels. Vocabulary, visual metaphors, and visual capture strategies are shared. Although the preservice teachers are surprised at the short amount of time they are allowed to view the shape, they soon adjust to the short exposure that is essential in building mental imagery. The conversation about figure 1a that follows occurred early in the semester in a middle-grades methods class. Note the simple descriptions given by each preservice teacher.

"Draw helps activate our preservice teachers’ spatial reasoning and communication skills. They develop their mathematics vocabulary by recognizing that rhombus is the mathematics term for what is loosely called a diamond. Our middle-grades preservice teachers more consistently use terms such as acute angle and obtuse angle rather than line and other less precise geometric terms, as especially noted with Sal. There is clear evidence in Sal’s activity that she was developing her spatial sense. Students who have well-developed spatial sense tend to solve tasks in more meaningful ways, not just as rote learners (Reynolds and Wheatley 1997), which is why spatial instruction is important. It could be argued that Sal is progressing in her thinking about spatial tasks. It is our hope as mathematics educators that she will provide the same experiences  for students in her own classroom. Interaction with students is one way for our preservice teachers to look at what they have experienced using spatial tasks and focus on students’ mathematical activity. ",33,mtms2008-09-101a,,

"To help our preservice teachers focus on students’ thinking, their assignments include conducting five interactions with middle schoolers using Quick Draw. One purpose of the interview is to learn how a student communicates and thinks mathematically on a spatial-visualization task. During the interviews, the preservice teacher begins the session with Quick Draw, then moves on to a problemsolving task. A written report of one such interview is due every other week, which purposefully coincides with articles assigned concerning spatial sense. After all are completed, a final report summarizes the five interviews. ",35,mtms2008-09-101a,,
"For the spatial activity portion of  the student interaction, we emphasize that our preservice teachers pay close attention to the way that the questions are worded in the Quick Draw instructions. For example, Wheatley (2007) emphasizes that the preservice teachers should avoid either making judgments or encouraging the student to make judgments about the correctness of their drawing. He also offers specific questioning techniques and suggestions regarding administration of the task. Since the goal is to build on mental imagery in particular, the text emphasizes presenting the images for three seconds so the middlegrades students are not just copying the image. ",36,mtms2008-09-101a,,
"When setting up the student  interactions, we instruct our preservice teachers to consult with their cooperating teacher at the beginning of the semester as to which student they choose to interview. In some ",37,mtms2008-09-101a,,

The interviews are often scheduled one on one in a quiet place, such as the school library. At times we find that our preservice teachers are asked to implement Quick Draw with the entire class they are placed in for their field experience (not their student teaching). When this happens, our preservice teachers experience what Wheatley intended, which is to have rich mathematical discussions between and among students and teachers. ",39,mtms2008-09-101a,,
"However, our preservice teachers are not always placed in classrooms where implementing Quick Draw with an entire class of middle-grades students (or even small groups) can be done consistently. Keep in mind, the structure of the field experiences in our teacher education program requires that our preservice teachers first observe middle-grades classes, then work with small groups of students, and ultimately finish with student teaching. Our preservice teachers typically fall somewhere at the beginning or middle of this scenario when they are taking mathematics methods courses. Therefore, we highlight their Quick Draw experiences with middle-grades students from a one-on-one perspective. ",40,mtms2008-09-101a,,
"Our preservice teachers often  begin their first few student interactions using Quick Draw images such as those shown in figure 3a and 3b. However, they often use their own discretion and choose more advanced images (as shown in fig. 3c and 3d,) based on the reaction and performance of the middle-grades student. For example, if a student quickly draws the image presented to him or her with little effort, that may be a sign to try more difficult images. Our preservice teachers are often surprised at how much quicker middle-grades students catch on to the activity compared with the preservice teachers in methods class. They frequently remark that the middle schoolers ask for more images to review, because they enjoy the activity so much. Their reflections also indicate that as the third, fourth, and fifth interviews are conducted, the middle-grades student tends to explore more and more avenues during the problem-solving portion of the interview, which consists of an open-ended problem- solving task. This is important because our preservice teachers experience how a spatial task can enhance a problem-solving task for a middlegrades student. The following is an example of one task: ",41,mtms2008-09-101a,,

"In terms of the mathematical language that comes out of the Quick Draw portion of the student interaction, our preservice teachers often describe rich discussions they had about an image with their middlegrades student. They notice that their middle-grades students saw or described the image differently than how they drew the image. For example, one preservice teacher made these comments about the diagram in figure 4: ",45,mtms2008-09-101a,,
"Prior to revealing the image I had just shown, I asked him how he saw the image. He said he first saw four trapezoids but then noticed a hallway. But then when I asked how he drew the image, he said he drew a large rectangle, a small one inside of it, and then placed an X across it. I was surprised at the complex way he viewed the image in only three seconds but then drew it using a simple technique.",46,mtms2008-09-101a,,
"Every other week, our preservice teachers bring in work from the student interactions, such as Quick Draw images made by the student and any notes or observations about their time together. The purpose is to monitor the preservice teachers’ progress with their middle-grades student. In class, we discuss the interactions and encourage questions and conversations about various findings. During these conversations, preservice teachers may mention difficulties in getting their middle-grades student to express ideas. They also use the time to share positive experiences they are having. They often explain how much progress their middle-grades student has made as a result of the tools from methods class discussions. Better communication of ideas and an improvement of the Quick Draw images are the two most noted comments made by our preservice teachers about their middle-grades student.",47,mtms2008-09-101a,,

"In addition to learning about  students’ thinking and communication, preservice teachers learned the importance of fostering communication as they teach mathematics. They learned that communication occurred more and more as they enabled students to think and talk about a particular image. They often noted that when they displayed the image after their student had drawn it (the  accurate way of implementing Quick Draw), even more communication occurred. It was often indicated that the communication aspect of the spatial activity is what made the student’s thinking come alive, as found in the excerpts below. ",54,mtms2008-09-101a,,

In order to learn about Emily’s thinking and learning, I didn’t want to lead Emily but also wanted her to understand what I needed her to do. A good example came from our first Quick Draw activity. Emily was fairly successful in drawing the shapes . . . but I wanted her to explain how she saw the shape. I asked her, “How did you draw the shape?” Her answer was, “I just drew it, I drew this line, then this one, etc.!” I realized that I needed to rephrase the question so she would understand that I wanted to learn how she looked at the original picture in order to remember how to lay it out on her paper. I then asked her, “When you looked at the shape, what did you do to remember it so you could draw it when I covered it up?” This question led to a much more complete answer.

But in the end, we both enjoyed the exchange of mathematical knowledge  that occurred when we had conversations over what would make sense rather than merely checking a right or wrong answer.

He would talk to other students or randomly draw something, not really paying attention; however, after working with Quick Draw, he began to concentrate on the problems I gave him. I also tried Quick Draw with the Algebra class that  I taught. . . . It’s a great icebreaker at the beginning of class. I think that it helped them focus on the task at hand for the day.

Students also began to discuss terminology that they heard their classmates using. For example, once two or three students began using a word, others would pick it up as well.

"In this article, we have described how we incorporated meaningful spatialreasoning tasks into our mathematics teacher education program. A key component in our activities is giving preservice teachers time to communicate. The majority of teachers have had minimal experiences with spatial tasks as part of their own K–12 mathematics curriculum; thus, their spatial ability is underdeveloped. The importance of thinking spatially is being increasingly recognized (National Research Council 2006). Not only do we believe it is important for our preservice teachers to develop their own spatial abilities,  we also think it is equally important for them to present the in-class activities to the middle-grades or elementary students. In the future, we plan to implement “The Wheatley Test of Spatial Ability” with our preservice teachers and with middle-grades students to collect empirical data on the progress of their spatial abilities. Spatial tasks are an important component of our methods curriculum, because they develop the thinking of our preservice teachers. ",71,mtms2008-09-101a,,
