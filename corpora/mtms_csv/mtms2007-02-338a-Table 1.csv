"While talking with parents and other noneducators, I try to be careful when  using education jargon; however, that does not always mean that we are communicating about the same thing. ",2,mtms2007-02-338a,,
"Before  one  parent-night  gathering,  I  posted  a  task  that  was  an  example  of Standards-based mathematics. During the actual meeting, I was thrilled to see how  many  different  strategies  parents  were  proposing  to  solve  the  task.  During our discussions, I pointed out features of the NCTM’s Standards that were embodied in the problem. I mentioned that it is important for students to be able to explain how they solved problems, just as they had shared their approaches. One parent who raised her hand was obviously puzzled. She asked, “Haven’t we always been asked to show our work?” Her question reminded me once again that what we share with parents is interpreted based on their personal knowledge from, and experience in, mathematics classes. By contrasting the notion of “show your work,” which has traditionally meant following the steps that have been modeled in the lesson, to “explain how you solved it,” parents in that group could understand the principle involved. It was an important distinction for them to make. ",3,mtms2007-02-338a,,
"From an educational perspective, when students are able to select and apply any  appropriate  strategy,  they  use  prior  knowledge  to  design  their  approach. Their strategy is grounded in understanding, and the problem is likely to be related  to  other  mathematics.  In  the  example  on  the  Take-Home  Page,  studentinvented approaches build on their understanding of the relationship between the numerator and denominator and the idea of equivalence. The concepts of ratio and of scale factors can also be applied. A teacher can observe from either oral or written explanations to what extent students understand these relationships. In listening to classmates who have a different approach, students can expand on their own repertoire of strategies and deepen their understanding of relationships between numbers. In classrooms that have an “explain your thinking” culture, students must have a conceptual understanding of the problem to be able to explain how they solved the task and to interpret and evaluate the solutions of their classmates.

"The  Take-Home  Page  can  be  used  as  a  stand-alone  piece,  or  you  can  send home a problem that can be solved using multiple approaches. Challenge your students  to  ask  their  family  members  to  solve  it  and  compare  the  approaches each person used. ",5,mtms2007-02-338a,,

"How is “showing your strategy” different from “showing your work”? “Show  your  work”  is  something  that  many  of  us  have been asked to do on mathematics homework, starting in  elementary  school  and  continuing  on  through  high school and college. Here is a familiar example.  15 60 40",24,mtms2007-02-338a,,
Solve for x. Show your work.,25,mtms2007-02-338a,,
60,26,mtms2007-02-338a,,
"To  many,  “show  your  work”  is  the  same  as  “show 60 each step.” These steps, explained to the student before working on the problem, might include the following:  600 60",27,mtms2007-02-338a,,
Copy the original problem:  15 60 15,28,mtms2007-02-338a,,
Cross multiply: 60,29,mtms2007-02-338a,,
Multiply the two given numbers:         60x = 600  600 60 600 60 40 40 60 60 60 60,30,mtms2007-02-338a,,
Divide both sides by 60:              60x = (40)(15),31,mtms2007-02-338a,,
"Simplify:               x =10   (Note: The phrases were simply added for clariﬁ cation, since the student would usually just do the steps without an explanation.) This example of solving a proportion may be familiar to you, since it is the standard process for such a problem. Therefore, what is the purpose of showing one’s work? There are three possible answers: (1) if a student makes a mistake, the teacher can see where it occurred; (2) it helps the student keep track of where he or she is in solving the problem; and (3) it ensures that the student actually does the work. ",32,mtms2007-02-338a,,
"If your child is being asked to “show your thinking,” then the solution process is a personal choice. The student  would  solve  the  problem  and  explain  how  it  was done. Here are some possible ways that a student might explain his or her thinking about the problem: “I know that 15 is 1/4 of 60, so I just found 1/4 of 40, which is 10”; “I simpliﬁ ed the fraction 15/60 to be 1/4, and then it was easy to see that the numerator for the fraction with 40 in the denominator was 10”; “I looked at the denominators and saw that to get from 40 to 60, I would need to multiply by 1.5. So, in thinking backward, I needed a number to multiply by 1.5 to get 15, which is 10”; and “I compared the numerator of 15 with its denominator 60 and saw that it takes 4 ﬁ fteens to make 60, so I needed a 10 in the other numerator because 4 tens is 40.”",33,mtms2007-02-338a,,
"There are probably other ways a student might solve  the proportion, especially because the numbers are considered to be “friendly”; in other words, they are easy to compute. Even if they were not friendly, however, a student could use the strategies mentioned above, such as comparing the numerator to its denominator and making sure the ratio is the same. Such strategies require that a student understands the relationships in this problem (between numerator and denominator, between denominators  and  equivalent  fractions).  Why  would  a  teacher ask a student to explain his or her thinking? One reason might be to see whether a strategy is in use that is efﬁ cient and will always work. Another reason might be for other students to hear different approaches to the problem. In addition, teachers may want to see not only if a student can ﬁ nd an answer, but also if he or she understands the important proportional relationships in the task. ",34,mtms2007-02-338a,,
"Showing  steps  and  explaining  one’s  thinking  both have  a  place  in  a  mathematics  class.  Showing  one’s steps is a well-established practice, but explaining one’s thinking is an important part of doing mathematics that should be included when learning any math concept. Explaining one’s thinking has the following beneﬁ ts: •  A student uses a strategy that makes sense to him or  •  A student learns from hearing and/or watching other  her.  students’ strategies.",35,mtms2007-02-338a,,
"•  There  are  often  many  ways  to  approach  a  mathematics problem, so the process captures the nature of real mathematics.",36,mtms2007-02-338a,,
"•  A  student  is  in  the  role  of  mathematician  rather  than  observer.  •  This practice accommodates different learning styles  and different backgrounds.  •  A  student  is  not  imitating  (e.g.,  a  natural  teacher’s approach),  but  inventing.  This  higher-level  thinking process involves truly “doing mathematics.” ",37,mtms2007-02-338a,,
"In the problem posed above, using the standard process of cross multiplication is more cumbersome than exploring some mental strategies. If students are simply asked  to  show  their  work  (to  follow  a  standard  procedure), they will likely overlook opportunities to use more efﬁ cient approaches. When students are encouraged to explain  their  thinking,  they  can  examine  the  problem ﬁ rst to decide how they want to solve it. ",38,mtms2007-02-338a,,
"This process carries over to homework problems. As you work with your child in helping with homework, you can ask, “Let’s look at this problem and see whether you can come up with a way to solve it.” You may ﬁ nd that your child is much better at thinking up a good strategy than trying to recall someone else’s approach to doing the problem.
