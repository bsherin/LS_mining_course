Developing MatheMatical unDerstanDing through representations,1,mtms2007-01-288a,,
"A ccording  to  the  nctM’s   •  What resources (print, manipulative, or electronic) are most useful in teaching specific mathematical ideas through varied representations? •  supporting  english  as  second  Lan- •  reaching low- and high-achieLving   guage learners",2,mtms2007-01-288a,,
"Principles  and  Standards for School  Mathematics,  students’ implementation  of,  and  flexibility  with,  varied  representations  are central to studying mathematics for deeper  understanding.  representations include  physical  objects,  drawings,  charts,  graphs,  and  symbols  to  organize  and  record  one’s  thinking  about  mathematical  ideas  and  solutions  through  problem  solving.  often,  teachers  and  students  have  a  predominant  representation  that they use when solving problems, whether numeric,  geometric,  or  algebraic  in  nature.  to  support  better  understanding  of connections  and  relationships  in  mathematics, it is essential that both teachers and  students  be  able  to  use  a  variety  of representations.",3,mtms2007-01-288a,,
"the  editorial  Panel  of  Mathematics teaching in the Middle school seeks manuscripts  related  to  the  use  of  a  variety  of representations  in  developing  and  supporting  both  a  procedural  and  a  conceptual understanding of mathematics in the middle  grades.  how  the  use  of  represen- tations  contributes  to  the  mathematics success  of  all  students  is  central  to  this call  that  includes,  but  is  not  limited  to, these topics: •  teaching  toward  students’  preferred  learning approaches students •  Using technology •  impacting the curriculum •  connecting to assessment examples  of  ways  that  teachers  have addressed  representations  in  the  classroom  and  how  students  have  responded to  the  use  of  varied  representations  are requested.  suggested  topics  for  a  manuscript  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  articles that address one or more of the following questions: •  What representations are most useful for a particular mathematical concept?  •  Are specific mathematical concepts or ideas taught or learned more effectively through the use of multiple representations? •  how does flexibility in the use of representations impact student understanding, and does it vary across grade levels? •  What are barriers or challenges in teaching through representations? •  how does the use of technology relate to an effective use of representations? •  how does the use of representations impact english as second Language learners, gifted students, or students with specific learning disabilities? •  how are representations used to differentiate instructions? •  how are representations used to   assess students’ mathematics  understanding?  •  Why do different students understand  certain representations better than  others? •  how do representations support connections, reasoning, communication, and problem solving? •  What is the role of the teacher regarding the use of representations in the middle-grades classroom? •  What has classroom action research  shown about students’ learning of mathematics through representation? •  how does the use and understanding  of varied representations impact mathematics language development? the  manuscript  should  not  exceed  ten  double-spaced  pages  of  text,  and  figures  and  photographs  should  be  included  at  the  end.  send  submissions  to  this  call  for  manuscripts  by  accessing mtms.msubmit.net.  When submitting  online,  scroll  down  to  “Manuscript  type” and  click  on  “Focus  issue.”  the  due  date  is February 15, 2007. l",4,mtms2007-01-288a,,
