Is 1 a PrIme Number? Developing Teacher Knowledge through Concept Study,0,mtms2008-09-86a,,
Brent Davis,1,mtms2008-09-86a,,
"At a meeting of eleven middle school mathematics teachers who gather monthly to discuss various topics, this question arose: “Is 1 a prime number?” The response proved to be a little surprising. The answer can be either yes or no, depending on the particular set of images and metaphors for multiplication that are discussed. ",2,mtms2008-09-86a,,
"This conclusion was reached during one of our regular concept study meetings. In brief, we discuss the images, illustrations, examples, analogies, metaphors, gestures, exercises, and other experiences that come up in the mathematics classroom. The term concept study borrows from the mathematical emphases of “concept analysis” (e.g., Leinhardt, Putnam, and Hattrup 1992) and the collaborative structures ",3,mtms2008-09-86a,,

"of “lesson study” (e.g., Fernandez and Yoshida 2004). Two other important influences are research into the evolving and embodied qualities of mathematics (e.g., Lakoff and Núñez 2000; Mazur 2003) and the growing literature on teachers’ knowledge of mathematics. In particular, our discussions are, in many ways, organized around the idea that teachers’ mathematical understandings are qualitatively different from those of other professionals (Ball, Lubienski, and Mewborn 2001).

"Our shared study of whether 1 is a prime number proved to be a powerful demonstration of the distinct nature of teaching mathematics. The point is highlighted in this article, in light of the discernments and elaborations that came up in our study of the definitions of prime.",6,mtms2008-09-86a,,
"Because such definitions usually  involve the idea of factors, this article begins with an account of an earlier concept study of multiplication in which the notion of “open definition” was proposed to help us cope with varied and inconsistent interpretations of fractions. Later, some of the implications of an open definition of multiplication are discussed, specifically, as they help to frame the question, “Is 1 a prime number?” The article ends with brief reflections on the role of concept study in the development of teachers’ knowledge of mathematics and its potential importance to the middle school mathematics classroom.",7,mtms2008-09-86a,,
What is Multiplication? the neeD for open Definitions,8,mtms2008-09-86a,,
"Our concept study group has been meeting for three to four hours monthly for almost two years. Our topics have included the concept of number, infinity, the basic operations, equality, exponentiation, and functions. By far, the most engaging topic has been multiplication, which has been the main  focus of three meetings and a recurring topic of discussion in many others.",9,mtms2008-09-86a,,
"The first concept study began with the question, “What is multiplication?” (Davis and Simmt 2006). The immediate and emphatic response was that multiplication can be understood either as “repeated addition” or as “a grouping process” (Davis and Simmt 2006). Such interpretations are, of course, appropriate for applications of multiplication that involve whole numbers or actions on discrete objects. However, these limited definitions can have some troublesome consequences. For instance, some might assume that “multiplication makes bigger” when it is defined in terms of adding or grouping. In other words, interpretations that are intended to be helpful can become barriers to understanding when students work with other number systems. The difficulties can also be amplified as algebra, vectors, matrices, and other topics are encountered in the later grades. ",10,mtms2008-09-86a,,
"Since the “What is multiplica- tion?” question did not go very far, I proposed a different one: “How does the concept of multiplication unfold through the K–12 curriculum?” This more open query elicited discussions of where and when multiplication concepts are introduced and extended, which in turn prompted examinations of how the concept is framed by textbooks and teachers. The group concurred that several interpretations of multiplication are used during the middle years of schooling. Multiplication can involve— •  repeated addition; •  grouping; •  number line hopping; •  number line stretching or   compressing; •  folding and layering; •  branching; •  making grids or arrays; •  area, volume, and dimension; •  steady rise (slope);",11,mtms2008-09-86a,,
Our unsuccessful struggle with finding ways to blend arraybased and numberline-based interpretations of multiplication highlighted the complex and sometimes conflicting ways that concepts are presented •  proportional reasoning; and •  number line rotation (for integer  multiplication).,12,mtms2008-09-86a,,
"For many group members, this list triggered considerable anxiety. Several teachers asked how the concept of multiplication should be introduced in class: “How should I define it? What is it, really?” In response, one group member consulted a mathematics dictionary. She read aloud that multiplication is “a binary arithmetical operation defined initially for positive integers in terms of repeated addition” (emphasis added; Borowski and Borwein 1991, p. 392). A colleague asked, “Wait a minute . . . ‘initially’?” He recognized this word as meaning that the definition was not complete. Did that mean, he wondered aloud, that teachers should present the concept of multiplication in the same way, as incomplete? ",13,mtms2008-09-86a,,
"In the ensuing discussion, a distinction between a “closed definition” and  fig. 1 Algorithm comparisons",14,mtms2008-09-86a,,
"A comparison of the standard algorithm for multidigit whole-number multiplication (a) and a grid-based algorithm (b). Although it involves a few more steps, the advantages of the latter include its emphasis on understanding of place value, a clear link to an area-based model of multiplication (c), a builtin estimation and check, and ready elaboration to decimal multiplication that does not require the subrule of count the number of digits after the decimal in the factors.     35 × 25 175 70   875 30 20 600 100 700 +5 150 25 175 750 125 875 (a)  (b)  (c) an “open definition” was proposed and illustrated with a list on the whiteboard. Several participants asserted that multiplication tends to be defined in closed terms; that is, in a manner that suggests a complete description. We wondered if it should perhaps be defined more openly as a concept that can be elaborated and extended, as different number systems are encountered and new applications arise.",15,mtms2008-09-86a,,
"As often happens in our concept  studies, the conversation moved away from the planned focus. For nearly an hour, the teachers discussed and refined the distinction between closed and open definitions as they debated pedagogical implications. We agreed that a closed definition could be treated as complete, whereas an open definition had to be structured not only to enable but to invite revision. Which sorts of concepts should be associated with which type of definition proved to be an engaging topic of discussion. Prompted by the list of interpretations and bolstered by the formal dictionary definition, participants concluded that in mathematics classrooms, multiplication is most often explicitly treated as though it has a closed definition, but its web of implicit associations grows more and more diverse  to highlight the evolving character of concepts, such as multiplication.",16,mtms2008-09-86a,,
"For example, in response to how teachers might help students notice different aspects of multiplication, several group members thought that they should choose images and algorithms more deliberately so that connections can be more easily made. They further argued that perhaps the most flexible and robust interpretation of multiplication is based on a rectangle. An algorithm for multidigit whole-number multiplication can be reformatted in a grid (fig. 1), which can connect the standard algorithm to area. This area-based interpretation can be extended to multiplication of decimal fractions, common fractions, algebraic expressions, and other continuous values (fig. 2).",17,mtms2008-09-86a,,
"When discussing multiplication of signed numbers, we were unable to extend the rectangle interpretation in a useful or compelling way. Drawing on Mazur’s (2003) description of mathematicians’ blending of “multiplication as stretching a number-line” and “multiplication by –1 as rotating a number-line” (see fig. 3), we were able to specify a few images that teachers have subsequently used in their class- as one moves through middle-grades mathematics. That is, multiplication must have an open definition.",18,mtms2008-09-86a,,
iMplications of an open Definition of Multiplication,19,mtms2008-09-86a,,
"Since it was proposed in our first concept study of multiplication, the notion of open definitions has been popular among group members. It also seems to be impacting their teaching. A major topic in current meetings is how participants are developing ways  fig. 2 Illustrations of fractional terms and algebraic terms + ½ 2½ × 3½ + ½  (2x + 5)(3x + 5)   2x + 5 3x + 5 3    +    ½ 1½ 7½ 1¼ 1¾ 8¾ 3x    +    5 2x 6x2 15x 10x 25 6x2 + 25x + 25 rooms.

In addition, it also foreshadowed a later conflict concerning the question of 1 being a prime number.  is 1 a priMe nuMBer? exploring open Definitions",20,mtms2008-09-86a,,
"The open definition of multiplication turned out to be pivotal when “Is 1 a prime number?” arose. Over a two-hour conversation and debate, all the interpretations mentioned above were raised and scrutinized. Two particular interpretations stood out, largely because they seemed to lead to incompatible responses.",21,mtms2008-09-86a,,
"1. “No, 1 is not a prime number.” ",22,mtms2008-09-86a,,
"From the beginning, the group’s favorite interpretation of multiplication has involved folding, which is actually the literal root of the word multiplication (derived from the Latin multi- “many” + plicare “to fold”). This interpretation is particularly useful for making sense of the multiplication of whole numbers. For example, if a page is folded into three equal-sized pieces and the result is folded into five equal-sized pieces, a total of fifteen equal-sized regions will be produced. This example can also be used to illustrate the multiplication of fractions: If a sheet of paper is folded into thirds and the result is folded into fifths, the page will be folded into fifteenths.",23,mtms2008-09-86a,,
"In these contexts, multiplication is a fold. As our group grappled with the question of what this might entail for the meaning of prime, we realized that we needed a few intermediate interpretations. For example, what is a factor? What is a product? What does commutativity look like in this situation?  fig. 3 An interpretation of 3 × –2",24,mtms2008-09-86a,,
"A number-line interpretation of 3 × –2, in which × –2 is interpreted as two suboperations: First, the scalar component indicates a compression of the number line by a factor of 2; second, the signed component indicates a 180 degree rotation about the 0.

"Some of our responses follow. The  arrow notation was selected by the group to refer to “can be understood as.” Although our first impulse was to use an equal sign in these statements, we rejected it in favor of the arrow to remind ourselves that specific interpretations are aspects of, but not equivalent to, the concept of multiplication.",26,mtms2008-09-86a,,
Multiplying ➔ folding,27,mtms2008-09-86a,,
"Factor ➔ an n-fold (i.e., 2-fold,   3-fold, and so on)",28,mtms2008-09-86a,,
Product ➔ the number of uncreased  regions,29,mtms2008-09-86a,,
Commutativity ➔ the sequence of  folds does not matter,30,mtms2008-09-86a,,
"From that list, this explanation was produced: ",31,mtms2008-09-86a,,
"Prime ➔ a product that must be folded directly. That is, a prime cannot be generated through a combination of folds. For example, the product 3 can only be made through a 3-fold. However, 4 can be made either by a  4-fold or by combining two 2-folds.",32,mtms2008-09-86a,,
"What, then, can be said about the  product 1? In this construct, the process always begins with a single region, which means that an uncreased page carries a value of 1; it has no folds what- soever. Hence, when prime is defined in terms of the necessity of a direct fold, the question of 1 being prime makes little sense. It is simply 1, the starting place. Let’s explore the flip side.",33,mtms2008-09-86a,,
"2. “Yes, 1 is a prime number.” ",34,mtms2008-09-86a,,
"Making grids or arrays is by far the  most frequently used representation for whole-number multiplication in our concept studies. The teachers also report that it is the most commonly used interpretation in their classrooms. According to this construct, a product such as 3 × 5 is understood to be a rectangular array that has dimensions of 3 and 5. Some of the implications of this construct are described below:",35,mtms2008-09-86a,,

Prime ➔ a product that can be arranged in only one rectangular array. ,41,mtms2008-09-86a,,
"That is, a set of objects that can only be organized into one type of rectangular array (namely, a grid with dimensions 1 and the number itself ) is prime. For instance, the product 3 can only be constructed as a single column (or row). However, there is more than one possibility for 4: 1 by 4 and 2 by 2.",42,mtms2008-09-86a,,
"By applying these definitions   to the number 1, we arrive at a unique rectangular array with  length 1 and width 1. Although  the factors, and therefore the dimensions, have the same value,  they are nonetheless distinct, since they extend in different directions. The product 1 thus satisfies the definition. It is prime.",43,mtms2008-09-86a,,
"Since we have made the case for 1 being both prime and not prime, what is the real answer?",44,mtms2008-09-86a,,
"One quality of this particular  concept study that I found surprising was that no one seemed uncomfortable with the conflicting result. On the contrary, the discernible collective emotion was relief. One group member voiced the group sentiment: “No wonder that question [of 1 being prime] always bothered me!”",45,mtms2008-09-86a,,
"Of course, the conversation could not end there, since in our curriculum materials the sanctioned definition of prime excludes 1. The next part of our concept study was thus to examine a range of formal definitions in the hope that they would allow access to images, metaphors, and other implicit associations. For this part of the study, we searched the Internet. After distilling more than fifty statements, we identified two common themes. First, all the definitions we found were written either in terms of multiplication or division, and generally followed one of two formats: 1.  A prime number is a whole number (or “integer” or “counting number” or “natural number”) that has ",46,mtms2008-09-86a,,
"If 1 is considered a prime, then whole numbers do not have unique prime factorizations exactly 2 whole number factors, 1 and itself.",47,mtms2008-09-86a,,
2.  A prime number is any whole number that cannot be divided by another whole number evenly except by itself and 1.,48,mtms2008-09-86a,,
"Second, slightly more than half the definitions explicitly mentioned the status of 1. Of these, most began, “A whole number greater than 1. . . .” Others included words such as “distinct” to describe the two factors of a prime. A few definitions appended a qualification of the form, “By convention, 1 is excluded.”",49,mtms2008-09-86a,,
"Our explorations also involved online research. None of the sites seemed to address the matter of why this question is difficult, although some provided compelling rationales for excluding 1. For instance, if 1 is considered a prime, then whole numbers do not have unique prime factorizations. If 1 is prime, then  15 has an infinite number of prime factorizations: 3 × 5, 1 × 3 × 5,  1 × 1 × 3 × 5, and so on.   It was clear from the search that there is no consensus. In fact, most mathematicians before the nineteenth century considered 1 to be a prime number (Gowers 2002). At this point, our concept study turned to a discussion of the likelihood that the production of formal mathematics, similar to the emergence of personal understanding, does not proceed by logic alone; hence, the need for open  definitions of concepts as “simple” and “basic” as multiplication and prime.",50,mtms2008-09-86a,,
"We could not leave the discussion there. After all, our curriculum materials specify that there is a correct answer to the question. After discussing our research, the consensus was that students should also be involved in some manner of concept study, in part to highlight that the historical development of mathematics has involved debate and conscious selection.  concept stuDy in the classrooM",51,mtms2008-09-86a,,
"Although organized around varied interpretations of multiplication and their implications for other concepts such as product, factor, and prime, the main theme of this article is not so much a bit of mathematics content as it is an attitude toward the learning and teaching that is embodied in a concept study. As illustrated in the examples, a concept study is simultaneously inquiries into how individuals learn mathematics, how mathematics is taught, and how disciplinary mathematics arises. Our study highlighted that all three of these phenomenalearning, teaching, and knowledgeare evolving forms that involve ongoing exploration and integration of new images, metaphors, and applications.",52,mtms2008-09-86a,,
"Perhaps the most important effect of our concept studies is the way they have highlighted that teachers’ knowledge of mathematics is indeed different from the mathematical knowledge of other professionals. The importance of holding open definitions of concepts is one aspect of the distinctiveness of mathematics. It has been interesting to notice over the past few years how participants’ attitudes toward mathematics have been affected. During preliminary interviews, most members indicated that their main reason for taking part in concept studies was to better understand specific  concepts. Their uses of phrases such as “real meaning,” “correct definition,” and “best explanations” indicated that they were thinking in terms of closed definitions. There is still a strong emphasis on getting things right, but the prevailing attitude is more tentative and participatory.",53,mtms2008-09-86a,,
"To this end, our current concept  studies have taken on a different look and feel. Before each meeting, participants engage their students in a sort of concept study by posing questions (to use the multiplication example) such as these: •  What are some of the different  ways you can talk about multiplication? How might you draw it?  •  For each case, what does product  mean? Factor? Division?  •  Where are these different interpretations more useful and less useful? Do they raise any new questions or tensions?",54,mtms2008-09-86a,,
"We have not conducted any systematic study of students’ reactions and the effects on their attitudes and understandings. However, a few consistent details are reported by  participants. For example, the foregoing types of questions trigger considerably more discussion and debate in class. As well, a popular topic of conversation during concept studies is how much participants are enjoying teaching mathematics and how such attitudes seem to be contagious in their classrooms.",55,mtms2008-09-86a,,
"At the same time, one common  observation is that some students are clearly uncomfortable with open definitions and ambiguous interpretations. One point of consensus among group members is that occasional frustration and discomfort can actually be quite productive in the mathematics classroom. As one teacher said, “At least they’re [the students] not just sitting there stewing. Everyone gets into the ",56,mtms2008-09-86a,,

"All the teachers have incorporated  different aspects of our shared work into their classrooms, but some have been a bit more deliberate in adapting the emphases and structures of various concept studies. For example, one participant reports that a regular activity is to draw concepts to alert students to the images and metaphors that might be at play. In another case, a teacher has organized her bulletin board space around interpretations of the basic operations and their implications. One board contains a continuously updated chart with the following column headers:",58,mtms2008-09-86a,,
If multiplication is . . . A factor is . . . A product is . . . Division is . . . ,59,mtms2008-09-86a,,
"Whenever a new image or a variation on an interpretation is noticed, an existing row is elaborated on or a new row is added. In this case, the teacher reports that students have taken on the responsibility for uncovering and developing possibilities. ",60,mtms2008-09-86a,,
"For the teacher-participants—as well as for many of their students— concept study is both productive for extending personal understandings and becoming more aware of the histories and evolutions of mathematical ideas. In the process, these studies highlight the roles of teachers and students in defining the cultural knowledge of mathematics as they work together to bring to the surface, question, and extend the images, metaphors, and other figurative devices that frame mathematical ideas.",61,mtms2008-09-86a,,
