"D A V I D   S.   H E D I N “T HAT THING IS TIGHT!” STuDENTS DID NOT  know  the  word  for  it,  but  those  learning English were attracted by the mobile that I  carried  through  the  halls  of  our  southern California middle school. They asked me, “You teach math, don’t you?” The mobile’s arms carved the  air  as  the  moving  sculpture  jiggled  under  my hand, captivating my students. ",3,mtms2007-04-452a,,
"The  artist  who  invented  this  form  of  sculpture, Alexander Calder (1898–1976), used his mechanical engineering  training  to  make  revolutionary  contributions to art in the twentieth century. Through the sculpture he called the “mobile,” Calder sought to define volume without bulk and incorporate movement and time in his sculpture (Calder Foundation 1998). Calder’s mobiles contained balanced arms that were sensitive to air currents and moved in graceful arcs around their fulcrum. (See the diagram at right.) ",4,mtms2007-04-452a,,
"Calder was trained in engineering at the Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, New Jersey. Linear equations may have served as a design tool, guiding the artist’s placement of weights that balanced the arms of the mobile. Specifically, linear equations could  be  used  to  design  mobile  arms  so  that  the items on each side of the fulcrum make it balance. ",5,mtms2007-04-452a,,

A Brief Biography,9,mtms2007-04-452a,,
CALDEr wAS THE SON OF SCuLpTOr ALExANDEr Stirling Calder and painter Nanette Lederer Calder. ,10,mtms2007-04-452a,,
"A child of the early twentieth century, “Sandy” Calder was a product of what has been called the “machine age” and the “air age” (Bourdon 1980, p. 65). Many of his mobiles were automated with motors, and he also  used  his  engineering  background  to  realize ideas  of  complicated  movement  in  his  sculptures (Bourdon 1980, p. 53). The technical dimension of Calder’s art was appreciated during his career. His show  at  the  Massachusetts  Institute  of  Technology  in  1950  was  well  received  by  professors  and students,  who  conjectured  about  the  mathematics that could describe the movement of his sculpture (Bourdon  1980,  p.  92).  Calder’s  vision,  combining art and technology, was not limited to mobiles. During the 1950s, he collaborated with architect Carlos raúl Villanueva and a private engineering firm to design acoustical tiles that resembled clouds or leaves for university City in Caracas, Venezuela (Bourdon 1980,  pp.  93–94).  In  the  early  1970s,  Texas-based airline  Braniff  International  commissioned  Calder to  prepare  unique  coloring  for  a  DC-8  aircraft  to promote its South American flights (Bourdon 1980, pp.  124–26).  (See  www.braniffpages.com/calder/ calder.html to view his colorful designs.)",11,mtms2007-04-452a,,
The Five Investigations,12,mtms2007-04-452a,,
THE  uNIT  ON  MOBILES  AND  LINEAr  ALGEBrA  IS divided into five investigations. ,13,mtms2007-04-452a,,
"Investigation 1: A Matter of Distance and Weight. Students  consider  three  simple  balanced  beams, with  weight  located  at  one  point  on  the  right  side  of the fulcrum and one point on the left side. They will use vocabulary related to balanced beams, such as fulcrum, weight, and effort arm. The teacher may wish to begin a vocabulary list or wall display to aid comprehension,  particularly  if  English  language learners are in the classroom. ",14,mtms2007-04-452a,,
Investigation 2: The Mathematics of Creating Balance.  Students  create  equations  representing  the physics  of  the  balanced  beam  and  are  introduced to  the  concept  of  moment.  They  also  consider  the limitations of the assumption that the balancing rod itself has no mass or weight. ,15,mtms2007-04-452a,,
Investigation  3:  Multiple  Moments.  Students  expand  their  use  of  linear  equations  to  model  situations in which more than one weight is on one side of the fulcrum. ,16,mtms2007-04-452a,,
Investigation 4: Balancing Balances. Students use balanced  rods  from  previous  investigations  to  create a larger mobile and represent the design using a linear equation. ,17,mtms2007-04-452a,,
Investigation 5: Designing Your Own Mobile. Students  create  their  own  mobile  using  the  template provided and their knowledge of modeling balanced beams using linear equations. ,18,mtms2007-04-452a,,
The  natural  student  grouping  arrangement  for this activity is pairs or triads. It helps to box the materials for each group because of the large number of small pieces. with a previous grounding in solving ,19,mtms2007-04-452a,,

Investigation 1: A Matter of Distance and Weight,54,mtms2007-04-452a,,
"See figure 1’s diagram. Attach a clip to each end of  the  rod.  Then  attach  the  hanging  clip  to  the rod so that it balances. Each clip weighs approximately  the  same  amount.  The  balance  point  of  a scale, called the fulcrum, is labeled F. The ends are  labeled A and B.  1. Measure the distance from clip F to clip A. Next measure the distance from clip F to clip B. weight will be measured in units of 1 clip. Therefore, weight A is 1 clip, and weight B is 1 clip. record the distances and weights in figure 2. The  indicates that there is one or more clips in that position. [Teacher’s note: The distances ought to be 9 inches.] 2. Multiply the distance from F to A with the weight at A. Multiply the distance from F to B with the weight at B. what do you notice? [Teacher’s note: The products should be equal or nearly so. If not, discuss measurement  error  with  your  students  and  encourage greater precision when measuring. Ask students to get your initials here _____ before going on.] ",55,mtms2007-04-452a,,
"Attach 1 clip to the rod at each end. Next, attach another clip to clip A. (Now there are 2 clips at A and 1 at B.) Finally, attach the hanging clip to the rod, so that the rod balances (see fig. 3).  3. Measure the distance from clip F to clip A. Next measure the distance from clip F to clip B. record the  distances  and  weights  in  figure  4.  [Teacher’s note: The distances in figure 4 are 6 inches on the left and 12 inches on the right or very close.]  4. Multiply the distance from F to A with the weight at  A.  Multiply  the  distance  from  F  to  B  with  the weight at B. what do you notice? [Teacher’s note: Again, the products should be equal or nearly so.] 5.

"Follow-up questions for Investigation 1 1.  In  which  question  is  the  fulcrum  at  point  F  in the middle? In which is the fulcrum F closer to one weight than the other? Compare the balance(s) with the fulcrum F in the middle to the balance(s) with the  fulcrum  elsewhere.  Explain  the  difference(s) between  them.  [Teacher’s  note:  Students  will  notice that when the fulcrum is not in the middle, the weights on either side are not equal. Astute students may also notice that the greater the difference between the weights, the more off center the fulcrum will be and that the fulcrum is always closer to the heavier weight.] 2.  Hold  your  arm  outstretched,  and  have  a  friend push  down  on  your  hand.  Try  to  resist  lowering your  arm.  Then  have  the  friend  push  down  at  approximately  the  middle  of  your  arm.  Try  to  resist lowering your arm. Compare your experiences with those of other students, and record them here.  3. why do you think it would be more tiring to hold your backpack at arm’s length than at your side? 4. Examine the crane in figure 6. Assume that the crane balances at F. Do you think the weight at A is more or less than the weight at B? Explain your reasoning.  [Teacher’s  note:  The  balanced  crane  is analogous to the balanced beam, and students will assume  correctly  that  it  behaves  according  to  the rule they generated in response to question 1.] ",57,mtms2007-04-452a,,
