Gojak. 205 pp., $37.95 paper. ISBN 978-0-87353-736-0. Stock no. 14546. National Council of Teachers of Mathematics; http://www.nctm.org.",,
6,Window on Resources (April 2016) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I appreciate how this resource provided a student-centered perspective with an approach to mathematics through problem solving (p. 6). This perspective effectively aligns with the vision and position of NCTMs Principles to Actions: Ensuring Mathematical Success for All and the Mathematics Teaching Practices (MTPs). For example, one of the eight MTPs in Principles to Actions is Implementing tasks that promote reasoning and problem solving; this resource provides tasks such as this as well as highlighting characteristics of high-quality tasks.",,
7,Window on Resources (April 2016) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Explicitly stating misconceptions that students have about some geometric concepts is another strength of the resource. I find this attribute to be insightful and of great value to me when it comes to planning and anticipating student thinking as well as task selection and the questions I might pose to my students. One such misconception was about reflections, that reflection lines must be horizontal or vertical (p. 60). This is very much in line with what I have seen from the students I teach.",,
8,Window on Resources (April 2016) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I appreciated the progression of chapter 2, Transformations. This chapter focused first on the general conception of transformations and kept the focus on the development of this conception and rooting out the misconceptions related to transformations before moving to the coordinate plane and connecting the work of transformations to coordinates. Again, a strong example of building procedural fluency from conceptual understanding from Principles to Actions.",,
9,Window on Resources (April 2016) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"This resource provides a solid pedagogical perspective, a wealth of research, insightful thoughts on integration of proof, and other content across the curriculum as well as tasks and ideas for assessing student thinking.

17,Window on Resources (April 2016) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Each exploration begins with an introduction that lists materials, prior knowledge, learning goals, and advice on the launch. The Student Handout presents the three increasingly challenging stages of the exploration. A Teachers Guide offers questions and conversations, anticipated misconceptions, solution strategies, and suggested feedback. An e-booklet, which is available at the publishers website, includes more detailed suggestions and tools for implementation, including effective teaching practices, parent communication, mathematical communication, and assessment issues.",,
18,Window on Resources (April 2016) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The explorations exemplify differentiation of depth and complexity with the Common Cores fractions progression. In Exploration 2, after studying fraction addition and subtraction, students are asked to use the digits 1 through 6 once each to find three fractions in which a sum or difference is equal to or close to a given number. The cognitive challenge is raised by asking students to find at least 10 solutions to an equation, then find all solutions and explain how they know they have found them all. In Exploration 5, students extend their understanding of multiplication to fractions by creating diagrams and writing stories to fit the situation. This exploration could be used with a whole class in that extra problems and supports for struggling students are supplied.",,
19,Window on Resources (April 2016) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,I recommend this book because of its challenging student explorations and for the wealth of teacher content and pedagogical professional development.,,

25,Window on Resources (April 2016) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"This novel is about a group of middle school students who solve mysteries using science and math. The League of Scientists is a diverse group of seventh graders who all love a different STEM discipline and who have formed deep friendships. In this first book in the series, the schools star swimmer thinks he sees a ghost in the pool one morning. The League decides to crack the case using logical thinking and deductive reasoning to help get the swim team to overcome its fears.",,
26,Window on Resources (April 2016) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Ghosts in the Water: The First League of Scientists Mystery by Sue Garcia would appeal most to late elementary school and early middle school readers. It is a fast-paced, easy, and engaging read that pulls in science and math content in a way that does not feel forced.",,
27,Window on Resources (April 2016) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The reader is exposed to just enough binary coding, marine biology, archaeology, and chemistry to have his or her curiosity piqued. The teachers guide has many suggestions for fun ways to explore topics in more depth.",,
28,Window on Resources (April 2016) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The one aspect of the novel that I found regrettable is that few of the teachers are portrayed in a positive light. There is one cool teacher who supports the League and an understanding principal who gives the group a lot of leeway, but most of the educators at the Leagues school are angry, impatient, and unsympathetic. A teacher even turns out to be one of the villains in the story.",,
29,Window on Resources (April 2016) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Overall, I highly recommend this book. I think that it would provide great opportunities for collaboration between math teachers and science teachers.",,
