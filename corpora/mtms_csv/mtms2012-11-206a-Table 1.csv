What are their names, and what do they say about each ﬁ gure? 3. A line of symmetry divides a ﬁ gure  into 2 congruent halves that are reﬂ ections of each other.

"4. A ﬁ gure has rotational symmetry if it can be rotated less than 360° and appear unchanged. For example, if you rotate a square 90° (the minimum rotation needed) about its center, it looks the same. Thus, a square is said to have “90° rotational symmetry.” Do the following ﬁ gures have rotational symmetry? If so, list the degree of rotational symmetry.",3,mtms2012-11-206a,,

My fi fth graders really enjoyed this activity. Many of them immediately related to the humor and started trying to create their own geometry “persona” in class. The students worked individually to solve all the math problems. Many students did not need help on this assignment and were able to complete it with minimal errors. They enjoyed the play on words involved in the activity and  even shared the humor with students who were not in our class. ,30,mtms2012-11-206a,,
"Almost all my students forgot that  we had already studied n-gons and how to algebraically write the manner in which one would determine the name of the polygon on the basis of its number of sides and angles. After I redirected them to that section of class notes in their math binders, all were able to successfully solve that portion of the assignment.",31,mtms2012-11-206a,,
"This activity was especially engaging and prompted much creative thinking from my students. They loved the assignment, and I loved watching their brains pop into gear as they worked.",32,mtms2012-11-206a,,
"I used student interest in the les- son’s geometry personas to explore my students’ creativity in math. Immediately following this activity, I asked each student to create his or her own geometry persona, record a detailed  description of the character imagined, draw the persona, and create a “conversation” between the persona and another (either from the comic or one that the student imagined). Students shared these in class and enjoyed seeing their classmates’ inventions as well. ",33,mtms2012-11-206a,,
"We completed this assignment late in the school year; otherwise, I would have displayed their creative ideas in the hall outside our classroom. Their work was over the top and such fun! I will do this activity again during the next school year, but will do it earlier so that the students’ work can be displayed and enjoyed by all. ",34,mtms2012-11-206a,,

"I teach seventh-grade students, both regular education students and those with special needs. Many of these students are reluctant to engage in the mathematics we explore and need something to draw them into an activity. They tuned right in to the dating scenario in this cartoon. They were engaged by the double meaning in “right,” and thought the descriptions of the other two “guys” were very clever.",38,mtms2012-11-206a,,
"This cartoon gave us a great opportunity to compare and contrast two- and three-dimensional figures. We used patty paper to explore the lines of symmetry. Since we were using figures that were hand drawn, there were not many apparent lines of symmetry, but that gave us a chance to explore what we could change about the figures to create lines of symmetry.

"My classes included 140 eighth-grade math students with varying levels of proficiency and comfort with mathematics. The overwhelming majority was engaged with the task from the start. Of course, by this level all students have worked with polygons and in depth with triangles. It was interesting to hear them debate about whether the “acute” guy was actually a right triangle; they mobilized their protractors to demonstrate evidence for their argument. One student cut out the “acute” triangle and overlaid the “right” angle on one of the square’s right angles. This led to a discussion about perspective and flat views. ",42,mtms2012-11-206a,,
"Completing the table for the first  six regular polygons was the most difficult task for my students. Drawing a regular heptagon proved quite challenging. The other difficulty was with the extension to the concept of n-gon. Because the entry in their table immediately before n-gon was octagon, several students assumed that the n-gon actually represented a nonagon. This was where my students with special needs were most likely to express frustration. “If an n-gon means n sides, why do we say pentagon instead of 5-gon?” In the future, when I am discussing polygons, I will keep this experience in mind and make sure that I use the number of sides with the proper prefix so that students will see the connection for themselves.",43,mtms2012-11-206a,,
"My students are fortunate to learn  in a technology-rich environment. As such, they are always looking for ways to use technology to aid problem solving and task visualization. “It’s All in the Symmetry” was no exception. When faced with drawing a regular heptagon, many were initially frustrated. Some persevered with pencil and paper while others accessed the Illuminations polygon applet (http:// illuminations.nctm.org/ActivityDetail .aspx?ID=202). This resource provides an excellent way to see the math embedded in the task.",44,mtms2012-11-206a,,

When a number of additional rows are completed, students can consider the number of lines of symmetry in an n-gon and the angle of rotation for each.",49,mtms2012-11-206a,,
"•  Have students investigate the  number of faces, edges, and vertices that Poly Hedron has. Introduce eighteenth-century mathematician Leonhard Euler (pronounced “Oiler”), who developed a formula that relates the number of faces, edges, and vertices of any polyhedron. A polyhedron is a closed, threedimensional shape whose faces are polygons. Euler’s formula is V – E + F = 2; V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces of a given polyhedron. Ask students if Polly Hedron demonstrates Euler’s formula and to identify other shapes in the classroom that are polyhedra. Students can demonstrate Euler’s formula with those polyhedra.",50,mtms2012-11-206a,,
