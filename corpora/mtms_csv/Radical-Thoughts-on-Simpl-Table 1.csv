10,Radical Thoughts on Simplifying Square Roots,"A picture is worth a thousand words. This statement is especially true in mathematics teaching and learning. Visual representations such as pictures, diagrams, charts, and tables can illuminate ideas that can be elusive when displayed in symbolic form only. The prevalence of representation as a mathematical process in such documents as Principles and Standards for School Mathematics (NCTM 2000), the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSI 2010), and the  (NRC 2001) reinforces the importance of mathematics teachers and their students using multiple representations when exploring mathematical ideas.",10,Radical Thoughts on Simplifying Square Roots
11,Radical Thoughts on Simplifying Square Roots,"Simplifying square roots and other radicals is a staple of prealgebra and algebra 1 courses because it is a requisite skill for studying many other topics in the high school curriculum (CCSSI 2010; 8.EE.2). To simplify a radical expression, students must analyze factors of the radicand and determine  whether any subset of these factors can be simpliﬁ ed with respect to the radical’s index. For example, if the radical represents a square root (index 2), students determine if any of the radicand’s factors are perfect squares. If so, the radical can be written in a simpler form. A basic example of this process using the traditional algebraic representation is shown below.",11,Radical Thoughts on Simplifying Square Roots

13,Radical Thoughts on Simplifying Square Roots,"In developing a lesson on this topic  for algebra 1 students, we sought to  address a variety of learning styles. Although we developed verbal and written strategies to supplement teaching the algebraic representation, we struggled initially to determine a way of representing a visual or geometric approach for simplifying radicals. After examining geometric representations of perfect square numbers (1, 4, 9, 16, . . .), we developed a way to think about more complicated examples (e.g., 18, 45, 72), creating tactile and virtual manipulatives that enabled students to explore radical simpliﬁ cation and other concepts.",13,Radical Thoughts on Simplifying Square Roots
14,Radical Thoughts on Simplifying Square Roots,"We wanted our students to initially  use this representation and accompanying manipulatives to demonstrate their thinking about radicals and their simpliﬁ cation. Through repeated use of the representation with concrete examples and through a growing familiarity with the concept of square root, our students should become accustomed to using the representation as a tool when thinking about more formal and generalizable examples. In this way, the representation will evolve from a tool of thinking to a tool for thinking (Fosnot and Dolk 2002). An analogy would be how young students initially use numbers to symbolize collections of objects (8 apples, 3 bears, 7 days, and so on). Eventually, however, the numbers themselves become tools for carrying out more abstract purposes (2 + 9 = 11).",14,Radical Thoughts on Simplifying Square Roots
15,Radical Thoughts on Simplifying Square Roots,We share our visual representation for simplifying radicals and our initial efforts to use this representation with middle school and high school mathematics students as well as prospective mathematics teachers.,15,Radical Thoughts on Simplifying Square Roots
16,Radical Thoughts on Simplifying Square Roots,PERFECT SQUARE NUMBERS,16,Radical Thoughts on Simplifying Square Roots

These squareforming numbers are perfect squares. Furthermore, students can determine the square root of a perfect square represented in this way by counting the number of objects along one edge of the square.",20,Radical Thoughts on Simplifying Square Roots
21,Radical Thoughts on Simplifying Square Roots,"Similar to using an array of objects, students can represent perfect squares with an area model. The area of the square represents n; the square’s side length is 1n. Traditionally, such a model is used when 1n has a wholenumber value. This model is viable because it can be partitioned into a square-shaped array of smaller 1 unit × 1 unit squares of area 1 unit2. A nonperfect square number such as 7, however, cannot be partitioned in this way. Although one can identify four 1 unit × 1 unit squares within the  square, the excess space within the square cannot be partitioned further in this way (see ﬁ g. 2). At this point, a discussion of an area-based geometric representation of irrational numbers, such as 17, typically falls apart. By shifting our focus away from squares with rational side lengths (such as 1 unit), however, we have found a way to represent the process of simplifying more complicated radicals. This simpliﬁ cation illuminates the underlying math of the algebraic representation and algorithm that are traditionally taught to and used by students.

22,Radical Thoughts on Simplifying Square Roots,AN AREA-BASED GEOMETRIC REPRESENTATION,22,Radical Thoughts on Simplifying Square Roots
23,Radical Thoughts on Simplifying Square Roots,"To illustrate our area-based geometric representation of simplifying radicals, consider 318. Similar to the square with area 7 square units, a square with area 18 square units cannot be partitioned into a square-shaped array ",23,Radical Thoughts on Simplifying Square Roots

27,Radical Thoughts on Simplifying Square Roots,"of unit squares (see ﬁ g. 3a). Therefore, 18 is not a perfect square. This square, nevertheless, can still be partitioned into a square-shaped array of smaller squares, provided that the area of these smaller squares is rational even if the side lengths are irrational. In this case, the square with an area of 18 square units can be partitioned into 9 squares, each with an area of 2 square units (see ﬁ g. 3c). This new conﬁ guration provides an alternative way to calculate 318 by examining the length of the side of a square whose area is 18 square units. Notice that the side length of the large square is equivalent to three side lengths of one smaller square. The area of each small square is 2 square units, so the side length of each small square is 12 units. Thus, 318 = 312.",27,Radical Thoughts on Simplifying Square Roots

29,Radical Thoughts on Simplifying Square Roots,"As a way to connect this model to the numeric solution above, the search for a perfect-square factor of 18 coincides with identifying how to partition the square into smaller squares with whole-number areas. The expression 49 • 2 is equivalent to the length of the side of a square array of 9 squares each with an area of 2 square units. In this case, 12 is the length of a partitioned side of the large square into the nine small squares. ",29,Radical Thoughts on Simplifying Square Roots
30,Radical Thoughts on Simplifying Square Roots,"Figure 4 displays a similar approach used to simplify 375. Increasing the squared factor of the radicand increases the number of small squares in the corresponding area model. As a consequence, teachers should carefully select the examples they use in class because some ﬁ gures may become rather intricate. ",30,Radical Thoughts on Simplifying Square Roots
31,Radical Thoughts on Simplifying Square Roots,THE GEOMETRIC REPRESENTATION IN USE,31,Radical Thoughts on Simplifying Square Roots
32,Radical Thoughts on Simplifying Square Roots,"We were eager to have students try to simplify square roots using an areabased geometric representation. As  we prepared activities, we considered the prerequisite knowledge needed to use the concrete manipulatives we had created and to transition eventually to abstract procedures. The key concept is the relationship between the numerical values of a square’s area and side length. To ensure that students ﬁ rmly grasped this geometric connection, we spent time at the start of the activities discussing this relationship.",32,Radical Thoughts on Simplifying Square Roots
33,Radical Thoughts on Simplifying Square Roots,"In considering the best way for  students to explore the geometric representation of square roots, Stephen Bismarck created a set of square manipulatives with whole number areas, dubbed exact squares, which students could arrange in conﬁ gurations like those in ﬁ gures 3 and 4. Students could select square tiles of a particular size to attempt to create squares of a larger area, physically modeling the process of ﬁ nding a perfect square factor while sitting at their desks. ",33,Radical Thoughts on Simplifying Square Roots
34,Radical Thoughts on Simplifying Square Roots,"In addition, we created activities  designed to help students connect  their use of the geometric representation to the corresponding symbolic representation. We wanted to see how students at different stages of mathematical study would react to the concept presented through the manipulatives. We chose to use the Exact Squares activity with middle school students who had not been introduced to the symbolic process for simplifying square roots, precalculus high school students, and third-year preservice mathematics teachers. By working with students at various levels, we could focus on how students connected the geometric model to the traditional algorithm. ",34,Radical Thoughts on Simplifying Square Roots
35,Radical Thoughts on Simplifying Square Roots,"Each Exact Squares activity lasted  about ninety minutes, comprising one class for the high school and college students and two classes for the middle school students. Students worked in small groups (three to four) and used activity packets and one set of precut exact squares (1 cm2 through 10 cm2). ",35,Radical Thoughts on Simplifying Square Roots

40,Radical Thoughts on Simplifying Square Roots,"The high school and college students began each square root simpliﬁ cation task by ﬁ rst using the traditional algorithm and then making the geometric model ﬁ t their calculations. Although this method inhibited the exploration and discovery process that was intended, the students could still make connections between their knowledge of the procedure and the geometric model. For example, one task asked the students to describe the geometric signiﬁ cance of each quantity used in the symbolic process (see ﬁ g. 5). After using the manipulatives in the geometric context, one high school student used a rough geometric sketch to conﬁ rm her numerical work (see ﬁ g. 6).",40,Radical Thoughts on Simplifying Square Roots
41,Radical Thoughts on Simplifying Square Roots,Middle School Students,41,Radical Thoughts on Simplifying Square Roots
42,Radical Thoughts on Simplifying Square Roots,"The middle school students, with no prior knowledge of the traditional algorithm, exhibited interesting ways of investigating the geometric model. First, they resorted to guessing or playing with the exact square model as they attempted to ﬁ ll in the  larger square. Speciﬁ cally, they tried tiles with area 4 or 5 before realizing that four squares with area of 3 cm2 ﬁ lled the space of 12 cm2. Next, they focused on the exact squares that corresponded to the factors of 18 using the large square. At ﬁ rst, they considered “3s since there will be 6 of them,” as one student explained, then moved on to try 5s, eventually ﬁ nding 20 and then 2 × 9. They then noted that the number of exact squares was always a square number. For example, with 348, students started with 8 × 6: [Modeling 348]",42,Radical Thoughts on Simplifying Square Roots

54,Radical Thoughts on Simplifying Square Roots,That’s cool.,54,Radical Thoughts on Simplifying Square Roots
55,Radical Thoughts on Simplifying Square Roots,"These students reasoned with the geometric model; looked for patterns; and, beginning with the 318 task, started purposefully looking for factors. This is evident through their initial choice of 6 exact squares of area 3 cm2 and assertion that exact squares of area 5 cm2 should not work. This process of ﬁ nding factors continued and was clearly articulated by one student as the group worked on simplifying 348. By the end of the activity, they made connections between the simpliﬁ cation of square roots, the factors of the radicand, and the presence of square numbers.

57,Radical Thoughts on Simplifying Square Roots,"Although the initial work with students using this representation is promising, we have more work to do, both in terms of developing activities that allow students to constructively work on more sophisticated radicals and in reﬁ ning the materials they can use, such as manipulatives.",57,Radical Thoughts on Simplifying Square Roots
58,Radical Thoughts on Simplifying Square Roots,Manipulatives,58,Radical Thoughts on Simplifying Square Roots
59,Radical Thoughts on Simplifying Square Roots,"One issue we encountered involved the precision of the exact squares manipulatives. Early on, they were created from foam. After we ﬁ eld-tested the foam tiles during work with the preservice teachers, we found the tiles’ degree of accuracy to be insufﬁ cient. For the next round, the exact squares were laminated. These squares were more accurate than the foam tiles but still contained enough error to provide a false positive (i.e., four 5 cm2 squares in simplifying 318).",59,Radical Thoughts on Simplifying Square Roots
60,Radical Thoughts on Simplifying Square Roots,Fig. 7 The expression 472 can be written a number of different ways. Connecting the exact square representations can help students see why only one way is completely simpliﬁ ed.

61,Radical Thoughts on Simplifying Square Roots,"The handmade tiles had irrational side lengths, causing a varying degree of inaccuracy in terms of both size and shape. These small or unnoticeable inaccuracies became apparent when multiple tiles were aligned. Although these inaccuracies did not interfere with students’ understanding, some were frustrated when implementing the procedure based on the squares. To minimize student confusion and frustration, teachers should be aware of this pitfall when using the tactile exact squares and should identify square roots that might provide false positives. To resolve this issue, we created and are testing a virtual version of exact squares using The Geometer’s Sketchpad®.",61,Radical Thoughts on Simplifying Square Roots
62,Radical Thoughts on Simplifying Square Roots,Partially Simpliﬁ ed Radicals,62,Radical Thoughts on Simplifying Square Roots
63,Radical Thoughts on Simplifying Square Roots,"When working numerically, students will often identify a perfect-square  factor of the radicand that does not lead to a complete simpliﬁ cation of the radical. For example, if students are simplifying 372, they may identify either the factor pairs of 9 × 8 or 4 × 18, leading to a partial simpliﬁ cation: either 372 = 1918 = 318 or 372 = 14318 = 2318.",63,Radical Thoughts on Simplifying Square Roots
64,Radical Thoughts on Simplifying Square Roots,"These simpliﬁ cations can represent an intermediate step to a complete simpliﬁ cation or, if the student does not see further simpliﬁ cation, will mean an end to the process.

67,Radical Thoughts on Simplifying Square Roots,"We are also examining other ways in which squares with whole-number areas could be used to explore mathematical concepts. One idea that may hold promise is using exact squares to demonstrate and explore the converse of the Pythagorean theorem. Although most explorations of the properties of right triangles begin with measuring the side lengths (which are then squared), exact squares allow the student to examine the triangles formed by different combinations of squared side lengths (see ﬁ g. 8).",67,Radical Thoughts on Simplifying Square Roots
68,Radical Thoughts on Simplifying Square Roots,A POWERFUL MODEL,68,Radical Thoughts on Simplifying Square Roots
69,Radical Thoughts on Simplifying Square Roots,"Our experiences working with students as they use this geometric model to simplify square roots led us to believe that students are extending their understanding of perfect squares and square roots. Although it was initially  used as a model of thinking about square roots and how they could be simpliﬁ ed, the individual representation is not an end to the process of simplifying square roots. Rather, the geometric representation can give students a visual connection that can support their use of the traditional numerical method, becoming a model for thinking. This visual connection can be continuously accessed as the student thinks through the process needed to simplify square roots, as exempliﬁ ed by the student work in ﬁ gure 6. ",69,Radical Thoughts on Simplifying Square Roots
70,Radical Thoughts on Simplifying Square Roots,"Using multiple representations  gives students opportunities to make connections among concepts as well as deepen their understanding of a single concept. This scenario is especially true in classrooms containing special needs, ELL, and gifted students. Currently, the process for simplifying square roots has been limited to one model,  the numerical hunt for perfect square factors. The geometric model detailed in this article provides an alternative. The power created by connecting these representations as a path to learning has great potential.",70,Radical Thoughts on Simplifying Square Roots
