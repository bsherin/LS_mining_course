Most students, thrilled by puzzles, riddles, and brainteasers, stay on task and focus for a long time to solve them. This project makes the most of this penchant through additional incentives: Students create their own math puzzles, combine them into an anthology in book format, choose a title for their collective work, and then distribute it electronically to all the students in the class and to their families. This activity provides a visual hallmark or a year-end product of their mathematical journey. Showing enthusiasm for the project, one of my latest classes selected MathMania as the title of their book. It contained a variety of puzzle styles, as shown by the listing in its table of contents (see fig. 1). ",4,Quick Reads: MathMania: A Middle School Puzzle Book
