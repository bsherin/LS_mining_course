"Mathematics sStory problems either bring students  to a screeching halt or send them into a frenzied search for numbers and operations. They cause greater anxiety, still, in English language learners. These problems are often the nemesis of many a math teacher. I recently grappled with this challenge in the context of teaching a series of lessons on integers and integer story problems. ",7,mtms2010-05-516a,,
"This narrative is offered as a specific illustration of how to apply key mathematics concepts when working with English language learners. It also illustrates the development of academic language, both vocabulary and structure, in the context of math. This intersection of math and language is explored through story problems involving integers.",8,mtms2010-05-516a,,
THE LANGUAGE OF INTEGERS,9,mtms2010-05-516a,,
"I implemented this unit in a unique classroom setting, a K−8 one-room rural school in which English is the second language for more than half the students. While working with second through eighth graders in this setting, age mirrored the academic diversity that so many teachers face. I wanted students to understand  the different contexts in which integer story problems might be used and ultimately to write and solve their own story problems. Students were shown photographs of settings that they would encounter in integer story problems: skyscrapers with underground parking garages, submarines and scuba divers, plants above and below ground, icebergs in Antarctica,  and a football field. By using these images, I was attempting to create what Verplaetse and Migliacci refer to as a “shared history” (2008). Together we developed a common background knowledge by exploring the different contexts in which integer story problems most often appeared. ",10,mtms2010-05-516a,,
"The images were used to introduce  the language of integers. Positive, negative, sign, operation, and opposite are abstract concepts that have specific mathematical meanings. This specialized vocabulary, one dimension  of academic language, refers to the language of school and the language structures and specialized vocabulary that accompany the study of any discipline, including math (Walqui 2006). Cummins captures the challenge  of academic language, describing it as abstract, cognitively demanding, and decontextualized (1981). This definition, “Integers are whole numbers and their opposites,” typifies these math and language challenges. The definition is abstract, requires thought, and provides an explanation that is devoid ",11,mtms2010-05-516a,,
Fig. 1 this poster illustrates a rich context for integer story problems.,12,mtms2010-05-516a,,
"of context. All students struggle with such definitions. English language learners are especially vulnerable, because they are attempting to process the information in a language that they are still learning.",13,mtms2010-05-516a,,
"I used an image of an iceberg to  introduce the concept of a signed number. We estimated the height of the iceberg and discussed how we could describe the distance its base extended below the surface. We tied these numbers to the definition of integers; whole numbers; and their opposites, such as thirty feet above the surface and thirty feet below. With each image, we discussed the location of zero, the origin, for counting up or down. When viewing a seedling, we pondered whether zero ought to be the level of the soil (above or below ground) or the seed (the point at which the stem grows up and the roots grow down). We used signed numbers to describe the location (above or below 0) of objects in the pictures. ",14,mtms2010-05-516a,,
"Finally, to model an upcoming assignment, I showed students an example of a student-made poster showing an integer context—a picture with a number line showing a cliff leading into an ocean with a variety of cutouts that could be placed above and below sea level. (See fig. 1.) ",15,mtms2010-05-516a,,
"The poster was used as a springboard to generate stories that focused on both location and movement.   If a diver jumped from the deck of a boat at five feet above sea level down a distance of twenty-five feet, how deep is the diver now? ",16,mtms2010-05-516a,,
"The problem was represented by the addition equation 5 + (−25) = −20. We generated a pictorial word wall that represented this new “language of integers.” My purpose in using each of these tools—the images, the poster, and the word wall—was to make both ",17,mtms2010-05-516a,,

"To practice integer operations, we moved plastic bugs both forward and backward on a number line. (See  fig. 2.) Using manipulatives to represent mathematical operations is both  engaging for students and enhances access to the concepts. Manipulatives provide not just a visual model, but the opportunity for kinesthetic learning as students actively represent their thinking and are prompted to reflect on the mathematical significance of their actions (Coggins et al. 2007). Manipulatives resemble pictures: They help put language into context for students.",21,mtms2010-05-516a,,
"Using the concept of integers as  directed distance—the sign indicating direction, the number showing distance—we modeled addition of integers (van de Walle 2007, p. 498). The operation of addition was modeled as the bug moved forward,  or gained distance. For example, with the equation 1 + (−3), students would begin at 0 (in the neutral position, pointing neither positive nor negative), then point in the positive direc - tion and hop forward 1, turn and point in the negative direction, and hop forward 3. (See fig. 3.) In essence, they were gaining negative distance  to arrive at the answer of −2. ",22,mtms2010-05-516a,,
"Although I focused exclusively on addition, the same model can be used for subtraction by showing the bug moving backward, or losing distance. To model 1 − (−3), the student begins at 0, hops forward to 1, and then points in the negative direction but hops backward a distance of 3. The student would then arrive at +4, having essentially lost negative distance. ",23,mtms2010-05-516a,,

"After practicing addition of integers, I placed students in multiage groups of three or four. They were directed to make their own poster, which included a number line, showing an integer setting. Each student was responsible for writing an integer story problem using the context of the group’s poster. ",25,mtms2010-05-516a,,
The students went to work with gusto on a context of their choosing. ,26,mtms2010-05-516a,,
"Their posters and story problems were as varied as their ages and interests— from roller coasters and daredevils on motorcycles to submarines and Egyptian tomb robbers. One group’s eclectic poster exemplified both our group norm of looking out for all group members’ needs and the range of interests and expertise the students brought to the task (Cohen 1994). The poster was set in ancient Egypt for the seventh grader who wanted to explore a problem about tomb robbers digging into a pyramid. Next to the tomb was a river with ascending and descending crocodiles to accommodate the second grader who adored all forms of reptiles. Finally, on the shore of the river, students included a cat climbing a tree (and falling into the river) to provide a particular sixth grader with the opportunity to draw her favorite animal. (See fig. 4.)",27,mtms2010-05-516a,,
"Group work in such a setting is beneficial to students. When they work in groups, they can use language to grapple with ideas. Well-structured group work provides the opportunity for students to use academic language, negotiate meanings, and delve more  deeply into content (Gibbons 2002; Kagan and McGroarty 1993). ",28,mtms2010-05-516a,,
WRITING STORY PROBLEMS,29,mtms2010-05-516a,,
"Although students’ posters were excellent, showing a wide range of integer settings and displaying appropriately scaled integer number lines, their written story problems were problematic. Some groups wrote elaborate stories that did not encompass a clear or complete mathematics question. For example, students might describe a diver jumping from a cliff (height unspecified) and plunging twenty feet below the ocean’s surface. Having already answered the question, they would ask, “Where is the diver?” Although their stories demonstrated appropriate settings for the use of integers, many students did not know how to embed the necessary information (At what height did the diver begin his dive? How far did he dive?) or pose a mathematical question (How deep did he go?).",30,mtms2010-05-516a,,
Learning language or using it  requires more than just vocabulary. Linguists remind us that the structure of language is as important as ,31,mtms2010-05-516a,,
"Fig. 4 the Egyptian story problem combines favorite student elements.  the words and needs to be explicitly taught, especially for English language learners (Fillmore and Snow 2000). As teachers, we often forget the embedded structural demands of language in our efforts to teach new words and ideas. Although I had paid attention to the language of integers, I had not unpacked the structural demands of writing integer story problems. ",32,mtms2010-05-516a,,
We set the posters aside and the  next day used our integer number lines and plastic bugs to explore the language structures embedded in integer story problems. I created a game in which students rolled dice (showing positive and negative numbers) to add a series of integers. The goal was to get the bug to the positive or negative end of the number line (+10 or −10).,33,mtms2010-05-516a,,
"We played three versions of the  game. The first time, I simply wanted to be sure that students could correctly move their bugs on the number line. The second round of the game, I required students to write the addition equations represented by their bug’s movement. For example, if a student was at +3 and rolled a −8, he or she recorded the equation 3 + (−8) = −5. The third and final round of the game was the most essential for explicitly teaching the structure of integer addition story problems. Following each student’s turn, I required his or her partner to ask a series of three  questions: (Answer: At +3) 1.  Where did you start?  2.  How far did you go?   (Answer: 8 in the negative  direction) 3.  Where are you now?   (Answer: At −5)",34,mtms2010-05-516a,,
"These prompts allowed students  to practice using the specific language structures embedded in integer story problems. Indeed, they provided a  context in which to discuss two different kinds of distance problems. The first prompt provided a starting point, directed distance traveled, and required students to express their answer as a signed number indicating the final location. The second prompt gave both the starting and ending point and asked students how far the object traveled, providing an opportunity, as appropriate, to discuss absolute value. ",35,mtms2010-05-516a,,
"With these structures in place, I  asked students to revisit their posters and prepare an integer story problem involving movement that they would present to the class. To ensure individual accountability, I required that each group member write a story problem. The groups themselves were held responsible for helping all group members complete the task and present their problems.",36,mtms2010-05-516a,,
"We gathered on the rug with white  boards, which students used to draw and calculate solutions to the story problems. At this point, the problems generally made sense. Some used the exact questioning structure we practiced with the integer bug game:  A Navy plane was flying at 200 feet in the air and gets struck by lightning. It falls 120 feet. Where did it start? How far did it go and in what direction? Where is it now?",37,mtms2010-05-516a,,
Other students adapted the structure for their story problems:   The shark is at −170. The penguins are at −20. How far does the shark need to go to eat them?,38,mtms2010-05-516a,,
"Most of the problems included the necessary numerical information to structure an equation, and most ended in a question. ",39,mtms2010-05-516a,,
We sat on the rug for over an hour  as groups presented their problems. ,40,mtms2010-05-516a,,
"By devising their own story problems, students are given an opportunity to generate their own creative models for working with integers.",41,mtms2010-05-516a,,
"Students asked clarifying questions, drew number lines and pictures on their whiteboards, and calculated answers. They demonstrated the ability to pose coherent and creative integer story problems and to solve them. When errors were identified, we discussed their causes. The students were confident and engaged. It was one of the most mathematically rich hours I had spent with this class.",42,mtms2010-05-516a,,
ASSESSING UNdERSTANdING ANd LANGUAGE ISSUES,43,mtms2010-05-516a,,
"It was time to test whether students could apply what they had learned. I chose a single page from a fifth-grade textbook containing four problemsolving questions in contexts involving an elevator, temperature, a scuba diver, and a football field (Harcourt Math 2002, p. 433). I read the problems aloud for the benefit of the younger students and encouraged all to make drawings or use number lines to help them understand the problems. Although a few of the younger students seemed to get lost in the text of the problems, the majority tackled them with alacrity, many drawing pictures and making horizontal or vertical number lines to  diagram their thinking. The students’ willingness and obvious confidence in grappling with the problems were important outcomes. ",44,mtms2010-05-516a,,
"Unfortunately, I found many errors  when I scored the assessment. Out of fourteen students, only two had perfect papers. Four of the younger students grappled with the problems but found the text, length, and complexity too much to sort out. The eight remaining students, spanning second through eighth grades, demonstrated some understanding. Some of their answers were correct, and their diagrams and number lines indicated an understanding of integers. Nonetheless, they made costly errors in interpretation or calculation. In a few cases, they forgot to include the sign for a negative number or added incorrectly. However, often the language of the problem was the challenge. For example, most students missed the following problem.",45,mtms2010-05-516a,,
" A scuba diver descended to 14 feet below sea level. She then ascended 4 feet and swam 10 feet ahead. She then descended 6 feet. At what depth is she now? (Harcourt Math 2002, p. 433)",46,mtms2010-05-516a,,
"One student, an English language learner, demonstrated clear thinking and made an excellent diagram but unfortunately produced the wrong answer. When the problem described the diver swimming 10 feet ahead, the student diagram showed the diver going 10 feet up. Most of the students missed this problem because they added 10 feet when there was actually no change in depth as the diver swam ahead. Most of the students had already demonstrated that they could interpret integer story problems with either vertical or horizontal movement, so this error appeared to be an issue of language and interpretation. It was noteworthy that when I revisited the problem with students, drawing the difference between ascending versus swimming ahead, students quickly corrected their answers.",47,mtms2010-05-516a,,
"This example highlights what  mathematics researchers describe as  strategic competence, the ability to both formulate and solve problems (NRC 2001). In the diver example, one problematic aspect for students was figuring out the difference between ahead and up when both had been used to describe positive movement. Language, rather than mathematical procedure, created the uncertainty. Most of the math problems that our students encounter in a textbook, in benchmark assessments, and on standardized tests, whether routine or actual problem-solving situations, are nested in language. For many students, language acts as a filter to their understanding the question. I would argue that the issue of language and its interpretation is deeply embedded in strategic competence. For many students, it turns routine problems into uncertain situations requiring the strategic use of reading and language strategies in addition to mathematics.",48,mtms2010-05-516a,,

"This series of lessons demonstrates a rarely acknowledged truth. We cannot teach math story problems if we are only teaching math. The math content—in this case, how to add integers—is necessary, but insufficient. Setting the stage so that students can grapple with the meaning of the problem and make sense of it is often the more challenging and time-consuming task, especially in classrooms where students struggle with reading or work in a language that they are still learning.",50,mtms2010-05-516a,,
"The intersection of math and  language calls for lessons that simulaneously contain rigorous content, build conceptual understanding, and develop language. This sustained integration of academic subject matter and language development is both a challenge and a necessity for teaching ",51,mtms2010-05-516a,,
"Students can apply their understanding of  integer addition and subtraction by playing  a game called “Hairy Weevils and Star Thistle,” which was constructed by the teacher.",52,mtms2010-05-516a,,
"in linguistically diverse classrooms, particularly as students move through the grades and into increasingly sophisticated subject matter (Bunch et al. 2001). ",53,mtms2010-05-516a,,
"The English-language-develop- ment strategies I used in these lessons enhanced access and mathematics learning for all students but were essential for English language learners. Rather than simplifying the text or the task for English language learners, we need to amplify and enrich both the “linguistic and extralinguistic context” so that students have multiple opportunities and a variety of activities and instructional formats to grapple with key concepts (Walqui 2006, 169). These lessons illustrate this point.",54,mtms2010-05-516a,,
"Developing in our students the  disposition, language, skills, and mathematical knowledge necessary for them to successfully grapple with complex story problems is a timeconsuming task. It is also a challenge in today’s curriculum so often driven by accountability tests. Teachers need time to delve deeply into critical math content, to present ideas in a variety of ways, and to unpack and assist students with the language demands of the task. Time is also a scarce commodity in our classrooms. Nonetheless, we must create the space for these kinds of lessons. Mathematics is ultimately a tool applied in context. Making sense of the context, the story, is essential to making sense of the mathematics.",55,mtms2010-05-516a,,
