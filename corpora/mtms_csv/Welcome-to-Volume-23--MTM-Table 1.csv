1,Welcome to Volume 23: MTMS: A Teachers Perspective,"MTMS: A Teacher’s Perspective tThe core of the MTMS journal has  always been to aid the teacher practitioner, and volume 23 will be no different. Being a classroom teacher myself, I always appreciate the various activities discussed in each issue of MTMS, many of which I have used in my own classroom. For example, this past volume year I used “Quilt Block Symmetries” by Matt B. Roscoe and Joe Zephyrs to solidify my students’ understandings of transformation in a way that allowed for creation and continuous modification of ideas. My class also explored various threedimensional shapes to help create the most efficient layer cake by consulting the article, “The Cake Contest,” by Colleen Haberern.

2,Welcome to Volume 23: MTMS: A Teachers Perspective,"MTMS is also my primary resource  for discussion on current happenings in the mathematical community. With much confusion surrounding the implementation of the Standards for Mathematical Practice, I leaned heavily on the Victor Mateas article, “Debunking Myths about the Standards for Mathematical Practice.” Formative assessment is something I use frequently in my classroom, and when I wanted a professional opinion on formative assessment, I turned to “Making Moves: Formative Assessment in Mathematics,” by Brent Duckor, Carrie Holmberg, and Joanne Rossi Becker.

6,Welcome to Volume 23: MTMS: A Teachers Perspective,"This journal is full of classroom  ideas that I can give my personal  stamp of approval. My students have seconded that endorsement through smiling faces and engaged discussions during the many MTMS activities I have used. The Editorial Panel is excited to share volume 23 with all our readers, and we hope you will share experiences similar to mine with your friends and colleagues. We would also encourage you to share your own classroom experiences with MTMS by submitting manuscripts to the journal.
