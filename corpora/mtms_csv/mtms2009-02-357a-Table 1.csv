"Report Card,” the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) was designed in the 1960s as a tool for monitoring student performance in a variety of subject areas. The original design included an assessment of nine-, thirteen-, and seventeen-year-old students. The first mathematics assessment was completed in 1973; additional mathematics assessments followed at two- to five-year intervals. In contrast to assessments such as the SAT, which are usually taken only by collegebound students, NAEP is given to a ",3,mtms2009-02-357a,,

"With this in mind, we have looked to NAEP data to determine how students’ overall mathematics skills, and their ability to solve various types of problems, have changed over twentyfive years. Specifically, this article focuses on trends in NAEP results for thirteen-year-old students, with an emphasis on the performance on items released to the public. Knowledge of  these trends provides insight regarding the impact of changes in curriculum and thus what seems to work in the classroom. A sidebar on page 362 contains information showing how teachers can use NAEP assessment items to foster classroom discussion and also to see how their own students compare with a national sample.",6,mtms2009-02-357a,,

"One of the problems with assessing nine-, thirteen-, and seventeen-yearold students is that they have to be pulled from different grade levels to get a complete sample. Age 13 students, for example, are commonly found in both grades 7 and 8. Thus, to make the administration of NAEP easier, the sample was changed to students in grades 4, 8, and 12, starting with the 1990 mathematics NAEP. In addition, although some NAEP items were used across multiple years, new items have been continually added, and the content of NAEP was adjusted to account for the changing mathematics curriculum. The NAEP given at grades 4, 8, and 12 has become known as Main NAEP.",8,mtms2009-02-357a,,
"To ensure that the ability to compare student performance over time was not lost, however, the exact test that had been used since 1982 has been administered to national samples of nine-, thirteen-, and seventeen-year-olds. This test is now known as the Long-Term Trend (LTT) Assessment of NAEP. In 1982, approximately 16,000 students at age 13 participated. Since then, sample sizes have ranged from 5700 to 6600. Each student is asked to complete about one-third of the items so that a nationally representative sample of about 1700 to 2200 students completed each item during each administration of the assessment since 1986 (Perie, Moran, and Lutkus 2005). LTT is the better indicator of change in performance over time, because almost all items are exactly the same as they were in 1982.",9,mtms2009-02-357a,,

"The LTT NAEP has one limitation. Because the test items have not changed, they represent the mathematics that was taught and assessed in the 1970s. It was administered in mathematics in 1973, 1978, 1982, 1986, 1990, 1992, 1994, 1996, 1999, and 2004. Figure 1 shows the overall mathematics scale scores for each of those years. Scale scores can range from 200 to 500 and, similar to the SAT, the scores indicate relative performance of students but are not directly tied to a “percentage correct” on the assessment. Although the same scoring scale is used for ages 9, 13, and 17, the scores are not intended for comparisons across ages. However, the difference in mean scores between ages 9 and 13 is about 44 points (varies by year; see fig. 1) and thus the average gain per year in school between ages 9 and 13 is 11 points. Similarly, the difference in mean scores between ages 13 and 17 is about 32 points and thus the average gain between these ages is 8 points per year (see, also, Kloosterman and Walcott 2007).",12,mtms2009-02-357a,,
"Age 9 scores climbed substantially  between 1986 and 1990 and again  between 1999 and 2004. Using the approximation of 11 points per year in school, this is a gain of about two grade levels since the 1970s and 1980s. Age 13 scores climbed 5 points between 1978 and 1982, remained relatively stable until 1990, and then rose 11 more points by 2004. With 8 points of gain approximating a grade level, this is also a gain of about two grade levels since 1978. The scores of seventeen-year-old students have been relatively stable throughout the history of NAEP.",13,mtms2009-02-357a,,

"this article.) The remainder of this article focuses on student performance from 1982 to 2004 on the subset of items administered to thirteen-yearolds and compares these results with what is known about eighth-grade performance on Main NAEP. Specifically, overall performance on LTT NAEP has been increasing steadily for thirteen-year-old students. However,  looking at performance on the released items, observers can conclude that students are doing better on the skills measured by those items. Unfortunately, the released items focus on a relatively limited set of topics, and thus the analysis is constrained to conclusions that can be drawn only from items that have been released. ",20,mtms2009-02-357a,,
"Table 1 displays results for the  twenty released items from the age 13 LTT mathematics NAEP. To better understand the data presented in table 1, we consider the items individually. Four released items involve addition, and five deal with measurement. After describing results on these items, we discuss additional items in which substantial changes have been seen in performance over time.  addition iteMs",21,mtms2009-02-357a,,
"Items 2, 3, and 4 in table 1 are the three most basic computation items  in the released set. Item 2 and item 3,  55 + 37 = ? and 35 + 42 = ? respectively, are both two-digit addition problems, although regrouping is required only for item 2. Performance was very high on both of these items over the years; between 95 and 97 percent of students answered them correctly on every administration of NAEP. These items were also given to nine-year-old students, who performed almost as well (Kloosterman, Rutledge, and Kenney 2009), indicating that the most basic addition skills are developed before middle school. Item 4—59 + 46 + 82 + 68 = ?—is somewhat more complex in that it involves the addition of four two-digit numbers. Performance on this item has dropped slightly since 1982 (86 percent down to 81 percent). However, performance on the item since 1986 is much more stable, ranging between 78 and 81 percent correct. This item was also given to nine-year-olds whose performance increased from 46 percent correct in 1982 to 57 percent correct in 2004, indicating significant growth in the ability to add more than two numbers in elementary school. ",22,mtms2009-02-357a,,
Item 16 (table 1) was the final addition item released in 2006. It showed a number line with an arrow from 0 to 4 and another arrow from 4 to 9. Students were asked to complete ____ + ____ = ____ based on what was shown on the number line. ,23,mtms2009-02-357a,,
"Performance was highest in 1982 when 47 percent of students answered correctly. As was true with item 4, performance dropped sharply after 1982, but in the case of item 16, there has been steady growth since 1992, with 42 percent of students answering ",24,mtms2009-02-357a,,

"Fig. 3 Measurement of object in nonstandard position 10.  How long is this line segment?   A. 2 cm B. 5 cm C. 6 cm D. 7 cm E. 9 cm the item correctly in 2004. Looking at the four addition items together, it is clear that students’ ability to add twodigit numbers was strong in the 1980s and remains strong today. Number lines with positive integers are normally presented only at the elementary level, but the relatively modest performance on item 16 suggests that reviewing this topic in the middle grades is necessary. Such review fits naturally with use of number lines to introduce negative integers.  iteMs involving MeasuReMent Items 5, 9, 10, 12, and 14 involve measurement either directly or through knowledge of units of mea- surements, such as the metric system. Items 5 (fig. 2) and 10 (fig. 3) are of the first type. Both involve using a ruler to measure, although item 5 involves measuring a pencil where the end of the pencil is aligned with the end of the ruler, and item 10 involves measuring a line segment in nonstandard position, which means that the first end of the segment lies along the length of the ruler. The performance history on the item measuring an object in standard position ranges between 81 and 85 percent correct, whereas the question using nonstandard position fluctuates between 55 and 61 percent correct (table 1) and reflects the greater complexity of  item 10. ",26,mtms2009-02-357a,,
"It is interesting to note that the  most common incorrect answer to the item in figure 3 in 2004 was not D  (7 cm) as would be expected if the student were reading the number on the ruler directly below the end of the line segment. Although 9 percent of students did choose D, 32 percent chose C (6 cm). They may have counted all the numerals underneath the segment (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7). Another possibility is that students realized the need to compensate for the nonstandard positioning by subtracting some amount from the total, but they did not understand what to subtract. Given that 6 is 7 minus 1, the students who chose 6 cm may have subtracted 1 from 7 because it was the only unit marker to the left of the segment. ",27,mtms2009-02-357a,,
"Items 9, 12, and 14 assess knowledge of the metric system. Item 14 requires knowing how to convert from liter to milliliter, whereas the other two require intuition or experience with the metric system. The distinction between knowledge of exact conversion rates and experience with metric measures may help to explain why performance on the items based on experience using metric measures has remained stable and relatively strong (ranging from 67 percent to 77 percent and 88 percent to 95 percent correct, respectively). Performance on the item evaluating usage of a process, however, has steadily declined over the years, dropping from 50 percent to 37 percent correct. Specifically, it appears that over time, more and more students are becoming comfortable with the size of metric units even though the ability to convert between metric units is declining. Knowing that there are 1000 milliliters in a liter is important, but understanding that the prefix milli defines the 1000 to 1 ratio for all metric measures may be more valuable.

"Items 18 and 20 test students’ knowledge of percent. Performance on both of these items has improved substantially over time. Percentage correct on the first of these questions, which requires computation of 7 percent of 175, increased from 23 percent to 41 percent correct from 1982 to 2004. Performance on the second question, which asks the meaning of .7 percent, gained 20 points, moving from 17 percent to 37 percent. As with the addition items discussed earlier, these items represent basic skills and provide evidence that there has been substantial improvement on a number of such skills over time.",31,mtms2009-02-357a,,
"Two of the released LTT items  deal with geometry. In the 1970s and 1980s, there was little coverage of geometry in the elementary curriculum and not much more in the middle school curriculum (Usiskin 1987). Item 15 involves calculating the perimeter of a rectangle when the rectangle and the lengths of two sides (8 m and 5 m) are shown. Only 51 percent of students could find the perimeter in 1982, but this number increased to 71 percent by 2004. Another geometry item (item 17) asks students to identify a figure containing perpendicular lines, assessing their understanding of the term perpendicular. Performance on this item has fluctuated over time from 33 percent to 39 percent correct, although the poorest performance was in 2004. In middle school textbooks, perpendicular is defined but then not often used; thus, the relatively poor performance is not surprising. This item was also given to seventeen-year-olds; 63 percent of that group correctly answered the question in 2004. The term perpendicular is important in high school geometry, and the NAEP results show that additional exposure to the concept of perpendicular makes a substantial difference in performance.",32,mtms2009-02-357a,,
"Similar to the situation with geometry in the elementary and middle school in the 1970s, there was little focus at that time on what today is called algebraic thinking (Carraher and Schliemann 2007). Item 19, which asks students to add 2x + 3y + 4x, is the only typical prealgebra or algebra problem in the released set, and performance has improved remarkably from 27 up to 45 percent. This type of problem is much more common in middle school textbooks now than it was twenty years ago, which can likely account for much of the improvement. This item was also given to seventeen-year-olds, and improvement there (64 percent in 1982 to 85 percent in 2004) mirrors the improvement at age 13. As was the case with the geometry items, the increased emphasis on algebra in the mathematics curriculum is the likely reason for the changes on the algebra item.  ltt and Main naeP",33,mtms2009-02-357a,,
"Sowder, Wearne, Martin, and Strutchens (2004) found that eighthgraders’ performance on items from the Number and Operations strand of the Main NAEP assessment improved or remained stable and high from 1990 to 2000. These authors describe  naeP and the Mathematics classroom",34,mtms2009-02-357a,,
"Given the diverse skills assessed by the released LTT items, it is hard to make many specific recommendations for instruction beyond those that Principles and Standards discuss. That publication suggests that with appropriate instruction, students can master relatively complex mathematics topics and skills. Main NAEP items can serve as tools for teaching and assessing such skills. Although the only released age 13 LTT items are the ones described in this article, the NAEP Web site (nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/itmrls/) has over 300 grade 8 items that were released between 1990 and 2007. These items can be sorted by content area and difficulty and whether they are multiple choice or constructed response (open ended). Percent correct is provided for all items, and students may enjoy seeing how they do relative to eighth graders across the country. The Web site includes a five-item on-line “test” that students can take and score themselves. In addition, teachers can select and print a larger set of items in a test format relatively easily. ",35,mtms2009-02-357a,,
"The diagram shows an eighth-grade extended constructed-response item that was released from Main NAEP in  1996 (1996 block M3, item 13, on the NAEP Web site). It is called an extended constructed-response item, because students must explain their reasoning to get full credit. The item was answered correctly by 19 percent of the students in the national sample. We provided this item as an example because it can be answered in several ways and it can form the basis for small-group or class discussions. Students could, for example, make arguments about the largest and smallest possible difference for the two girls; they could argue on the basis of place value; or they could simply argue that Maria’s difference has to be greater, based on examples. Discussion of the item could lead to questions about whether some types of solutions are better than others and how one knows when an answer is correct. Although only 12 of the released grade 8 tasks are categorized as extended constructed-response items, large numbers of short constructed-response items require some sort of written response. Many challenging multiple-choice tasks also lend themselves to multiple-solution methods. ",36,mtms2009-02-357a,,
"This question requires you to show your work and explain your reasoning. You may use drawings, words, and numbers in your explanation.

"Another option for using NAEP constructed-response items for assessment or class discussion can be found using the NCTM publication Learning from NAEP: Professional Development Materials for Teachers of Mathematics (Brown and Clark 2006). This book includes a CD with a database of student responses to released constructed-response items. The database includes 20 to 40 student responses to each of 17 different grade 8 constructed-response items. These responses reflect the range of possible solutions, as well as the common errors, for each item. The publication is intended for use in workshops for teachers on how to use NAEP data to understand student thinking. However, the activities are easy for teachers to follow if they want to use the items to assess their own students or see how their students’ solutions compare with others’ responses.  an item requiring addition of two three-digit numbers with regrouping (p. 114) where performance ranged from 91 percent to 93 percent over the decade. Performance on this item was similar to performance on previously discussed addition items and provides evidence that middle school students do well when adding numbers with more than two digits. Warfield and Meier (2007) reported that fourth- and eighth-grade students performed better on Main NAEP addition and subtraction problems than they did on multiplication and division, although performance on all computation problems involving whole numbers was strong. They also reported that students do better on purely computational problems than on word problems or other more conceptual items that require computation. This is consistent with the poor performance on item 16 (write an addition sentence) relative to pure addition problems. In brief, Main NAEP results are consistent with the findings reported here that students’ basic computation skills, particularly addition skills, are very good. No traditional word problems were released from LTT for age 13, but Main NAEP results suggest that performance on such problems is lower than performance on purely computational items.",42,mtms2009-02-357a,,
"Sowder et al. (2004, p. 119) also  discussed three items involving measurement and perimeter on Main NAEP. One of the released measurement items (2003 block M6, item 18 on the NAEP Web site) required students to determine the length of a toothpick when positioned from the 8-inch to the 10 1/2-inch marks on a ruler. This item was very similar to item 10 described above and performance was similar as well, ranging between 61 percent and 63 percent between 1990 and 2000. The results for the Main NAEP item, together with the results for items 5 and 10, ",43,mtms2009-02-357a,,
Elementary and middle schoolers are learning more mathematics than their counterparts did a generation ago provide evidence that students need more experience with linear measure where the zero mark on the measurement tool is not aligned with the end of the object being measured. ,44,mtms2009-02-357a,,
A related item used in Main ,45,mtms2009-02-357a,,
"NAEP asked students for the length of a side of a square whose perimeter is 36. Interestingly, performance on this item has remained relatively stable, hovering between 63 percent and 69 percent between 1990 (Sowder et al. 2004, p. 119) and 2003 (Blume, Galindo, and Walcott 2007, p. 114). In 1990, only 54 percent of students correctly answered TTL item 15, which involved finding the perimeter of a rectangle from the length of the sides, but that number increased to 71 percent by 2004. Explaining the different performance patterns on these two items is difficult, but it is clear that a substantial majority of eighthgrade students now understand the notion of perimeter. ",46,mtms2009-02-357a,,
"Finally, Chazan et al. (2007) report that performance on the algebra and functions strand of Main NAEP has shown more increase than any other strand at the fourth- and eighth-grade levels. This finding is consistent with the pattern on the LLT that asked 2x + 3y + 4x = ? (item 19). Moreover, Sowder et. al. (2004) report that the number of teachers who self-report “placing heavy emphasis” on algebra and functions increased from 48 percent in 1992 to  64 percent in 2000 (p. 107). This adds to the plausibility that changes in the curricula have contributed to gains on problems similar to this algebra item, as was hypothesized earlier.",47,mtms2009-02-357a,,
conclusion,48,mtms2009-02-357a,,
"The overall results from LTT NAEP (as seen in fig. 1) clearly show that the mathematics skills of nine- and thirteen-year-old students have improved significantly since 1982. As noted, the gains are approximately two grade levels for each population. Another way to look at the gains is to compare them with gains in other content areas assessed by NAEP. Campbell, Hombo, and Mazzeo (2000) note that gains in mathematics on the LTT NAEP are greater than those in any other subject area. Kloosterman and Walcott (2007) note the same for Main NAEP. In short, it is clear that elementary school and middle school students are learning substantially more mathematics than their counterparts did a generation ago. ",49,mtms2009-02-357a,,
"The analysis of specific LTT items presented here shows that basic skills are stable or improving and that performance on most of the harder items is getting better. Performance on items involving geometry and algebraic thinking, which were emphasized in NCTM’s Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for School Mathematics (1989), has improved. Drawing causeand-effect conclusions with respect to student achievement is always difficult, but the LTT and Main NAEP data show that students are doing better on topics that have received greater emphasis since publication of the Curriculum and Evaluation Standards. Thus, although mathematics instruction can always improve, the data suggest that these standards and Principles and Standards for School Mathematics (2000) have had a positive impact on student performance.",50,mtms2009-02-357a,,
"In closing, the results of NAEP are encouraging. Although one cannot argue with the need to improve mathematics literacy, Main and LTT NAEP data clearly show that middle school students today know substantially more mathematics than their counterparts did in 1982. Thus, as mathematics teachers, we are clearly doing something right. In addition, NAEP can also be a tool for instruction. The NAEP Web site is a good source for a wide variety of mathematics problems that can be used for class discussion or to see how well individual students perform compared with a national sample. With No Child Left Behind legislation now requiring states to participate in NAEP, this test will be with us for years to come.
