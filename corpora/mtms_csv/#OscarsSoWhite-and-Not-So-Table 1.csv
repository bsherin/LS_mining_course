The Oscars given during the 2017 Academy Awards were an exception. Although the nominee pool has somewhat diversified over the 87 years of the award, “6.4% of acting nominations of the total 1668 awards since the awards began in 1929 have gone to non-White actors” (Berman and Johnson 2016).

There are 23 Oscar categories  (e.g., Best Director, Best Actress, Best Short Film, and so on) with typically 5 nominees per category. How many people are nominated for an Oscar in any one year?  2.  If we know that 1668 acting  awards have been handed out since 1929, use the percentages in  table 1 to predict how many awards should be given in each race and gender category according to the following information:  a.   The diversity of residents   surveyed by the U.S. Census b.   The diversity in the population of active actresses and actors in the film industry c.   If 6.4% of the 1668 awards  went to non-White actors and actresses, how does this per-",19,#OscarsSoWhite and Not So Right Problem
