"For each of the following questions, you can use only pennies, nickels, dimes, and quarters.  1. In how many different ways can you make change  for a dollar? 2. What is the greatest value of coins you can have without being able to make change for a dollar? ",5,mtms2011-08-16a,,

"For the fi rst question, most students produced lists of all the possibilities for making change for a dollar. Julio (see fi g. 1a) and Nicolette (see fi g. 1b) made organized lists. Other students used Excel spreadsheets to sort out their information. Students who wrote the full set of possibilities produced lengthy lists; they found that their biggest challenge was organizing their lists so that they could determine if all possibilities had been found. ",8,mtms2011-08-16a,,
"The most common strategy involved starting with four quarters; as students reduced the number of quarters, they replaced them with dimes, nickels, and pennies. They typically worked from the largest denomination to the smallest. ",9,mtms2011-08-16a,,
"Lizzie used a system of reducing  nickels and increasing the pennies by 5 to organize her list and make sure it was complete (see fi g. 2). Occasionally, a student would start with 100 pennies and increase the denomination size systematically as pennies were removed. ",10,mtms2011-08-16a,,
"Another strategy used by students to fi nd the ways to make change for a dollar was to break the problem into cases, then identify and extend patterns for each case. Students looked at fi ve cases, based on the number of quarters used. Kimberly wrote separate problems for each of the fi ve special cases (see fi g. 3). She then solved each in a manner similar to the way David solved the problem. His work illustrated each case, which systematically changed the number of dimes and the resulting pattern in the number of ways to create the dollar",11,mtms2011-08-16a,,

Fig. 2 Lizzie explained that she used a system of reducing nickels and increasing the pennies by fi ve to produce a complete list.,14,mtms2011-08-16a,,
"I started seeing a pattern. Every time I had a certain amount of quarters and a certain amount of dimes, I would start with the most amount of nickels that I could have. This would always mean there will be 0 pennies. I would subtract 1 nickel, and there would be 5 pennies, since there are 5 pennies to make a nickel, to equal a dollar. I subtracted 1 nickel every line, and there would be 5 more pennies every line. This made my work faster, and I could be sure that it equaled 1 dollar. ",15,mtms2011-08-16a,,
Fig. 3 Kimberly’s solution involved five special cases of counting separately using various numbers of quarters.,16,mtms2011-08-16a,,

Fig. 5 Rachel J. (a) and Cooper (b) described their methodology for question 2.,19,mtms2011-08-16a,,
"For the second question (What is the greatest value of coins you can have without being able to make change for a dollar?), I thought it would be 99 cents. My Dad was helping me and he suggested $1.69 (3 quarters, 9 dimes, and 4 pennies). I disagreed because 2 quarters + 5 dimes = $1.00. Then I thought, “You can’t have 2 or more quarters and 5 or more dimes because 2q + 5d = $l.” I could do lq + 9d + 4p. That equals $1.19. I can use this because $1.00 ends in an even number; $0.25 ends in an odd number, 5. When you add dimes to a number, the last digit stays odd if it’s odd and even if it’s even. So when you add dimes to $0.25, the last digit will be a 5. Since the question asks for the greatest amount, the most amount of dimes possible without being able to make change for a dollar is 9 dimes (10 dimes = $1.00). So 1 quarter + 9 dimes = $1.15. And the most amount of pennies you can have is 4, because if you had 5, 25 cents (1 q) + 5 cents (5 p) = 30 cents, 30 cents + 7 dimes (that you have in your 9 dimes) = $1.00. My answer for the second question is $1.19.",20,mtms2011-08-16a,,
(a) ,21,mtms2011-08-16a,,
"The answer is $1.19. I figured this out by thinking if you have 3 quarters, 4 dimes, and 4 pennies you cannot have change for a dollar. I used math to determine this amount. This amount of money does not allow you to make change for a dollar because no matter what coins you have, you cannot divide them to make change for a dollar. My math told me you need at least $1.20 to be able to divide the coins to get change for $1.00. If you have 3 quarters, 4 dimes, and 1 nickel, that is $1.20, and you can take the 3 quarters and 2 dimes plus the nickel and that makes a dollar. Anything higher than this combination of coins has change for a dollar.",22,mtms2011-08-16a,,
"(b) (see fig. 4). Both students realized that as the number of dimes decreased, the number of ways to create a dollar increased by 2. They could then extend and complete the pattern without actually listing every possible combination. The second question posed a challenge. Students needed to understand that the greatest value of coins was requested, not the greatest number of coins. Some students simply wanted to tell us that 99 pennies would be the largest number of coins. Rachel J. showed this answer as her first attempt, until she had a discussion with her father. She then decided the answer was $1.19 by using 1 quarter, 9 dimes, and 4 pennies (see fig. 5a). Cooper also found $1.19 for the value, but he used a coin combination of 3 quarters, 4 dimes, and 4 pennies (see fig. 5b).",23,mtms2011-08-16a,,
"Although the original tasks did not require students to answer any further questions, several students did write and solve extension tasks that would be interesting for others to explore. Two student extension tasks follow: •	 With	the	four	coins	(quarters,	 dimes, nickels, and pennies), there are 242 ways to make change for a dollar. If I add 50 cent pieces and $1 coins, how many ways will there be to make change for a dollar?—",24,mtms2011-08-16a,,
