5,Making Homework Matter to Students,"During my teaching career (author Walk), I have been frustrated with student assignments being handed in incomplete, rushed through, or not at all. It made me wonder what students saw as the purpose of homework. I tried to impart the idea that the purpose of  homework was to help students improve their understanding of mathematical concepts, practice skills, and act as a formative assessment that could help me see what they currently comprehended. Unfortunately, many students seemed to think that homework was just another unpleasant task to finish as quickly as possible without thinking deeply about what they were doing. ",5,Making Homework Matter to Students
6,Making Homework Matter to Students,"Two studies (Trautwein 2007 and Dettmers et al. 2010) show a positive correlation between high-quality homework and mathematics achievement. Students who completed their homework assignments scored better on assessments. However, these studies also showed no relationship between time spent on homework and resulting student achievement. This helped verify that although homework can be a valuable tool for learning, more time spent on daily homework is not necessarily a good idea. ",6,Making Homework Matter to Students
7,Making Homework Matter to Students,"In continuing to research effective homework styles and implementation, I found in many studies that student collaboration was important in developing mathematical  reasoning. Wieman and Arbaugh (2014) discuss how students could use homework as an opportunity to work together. However, they also emphasize that teachers must be clear about their goals and expectations for student homework: ",7,Making Homework Matter to Students
8,Making Homework Matter to Students,"Students may think that they are supposed to be able to complete all the homework problems quickly and easily, and that referring to their notes or asking a friend for help is somehow “cheating.” (p. 162) ",8,Making Homework Matter to Students
9,Making Homework Matter to Students,Students must understand the difference between asking another student for help in thinking through a problem and simply asking for the answer. Homework does not need to be completed independently if the primary goal is to learn about mathematics.,9,Making Homework Matter to Students
10,Making Homework Matter to Students,LEVELS OF DEMAND,10,Making Homework Matter to Students
11,Making Homework Matter to Students,Smith and Stein (1998) argue that the highest learning gains for students result from engagement in high levels  of cognitive thinking and reasoning. They break down tasks in terms of four categories of cognitive demand:  1.  Memorization 2.  Procedures without connections to  concepts or meaning 3.  Procedures with connections to  concepts 4.  Doing mathematics,11,Making Homework Matter to Students
12,Making Homework Matter to Students,"Keeping in mind the appropriate level  of homework challenge, it appears that most homework tasks should be in the third category (procedures with connections to concepts). The first two categories are considered to have a lower-level demand for students because they can be solved with limited or no cognitive demand. The third and fourth categories of tasks require deeper thinking and understanding. These tasks might be more complex and often have multiple solution paths. ",12,Making Homework Matter to Students

21,Making Homework Matter to Students,"Although the fourth level may be appropriate for classroom learning, it is likely to be too difficult for homework on a regular basis and could negatively impact student effort. ",21,Making Homework Matter to Students
22,Making Homework Matter to Students,CHANGING MY APPROACH,22,Making Homework Matter to Students
23,Making Homework Matter to Students,All this research led me to wonder if my students would be more successful in completing and learning from their homework if they were given fewer problems with a higher level of cognitive demand. I already knew that some students have difficulties with procedural questions and that even those students who are able to answer such questions often have a difficult time explaining the reasoning for their methods. ,23,Making Homework Matter to Students
24,Making Homework Matter to Students,"When teaching prealgebra to my  eighth-grade students, I typically assign skill-and-drill questions accompanied by one short-response problem. Skill-and-drill problems give students repeated practice of a particular procedure and are intended to help them gain fluency. The majority of my students completed the homework problems, but those who often did not explained that they did not have “enough time” or did not understand what to do. These students were typically habitual offenders in failing to complete their assignments, and the homework never seemed important to them. I tried to motivate my students and access self-motivation by putting more control of the homework into their hands through additional time and choices.",24,Making Homework Matter to Students
25,Making Homework Matter to Students,"Focusing on the algebraic concept  of solving linear equations, I implemented a change in my homework style for several weeks. Manipulating and solving equations is a central concept for my students, and it is a skill that many have difficulty mastering. I thought this would be a good time to provide a better homework experience. My class received “cognitive” homework with fewer problems that ",25,Making Homework Matter to Students
26,Making Homework Matter to Students,Fig. 5 Revisiting ideas often allowed for better class discussion and participation.,26,Making Homework Matter to Students
27,Making Homework Matter to Students,(a) Donna’s work (b) Lois’s work had a higher level of demand. Weekly homework assignments contained suggestions about the number of questions to be completed each day. The presentation of the material for the unit and the structure of the classroom still allowed for time spent reviewing homework questions.,27,Making Homework Matter to Students
28,Making Homework Matter to Students,"In changing the type of homework, ",28,Making Homework Matter to Students
29,Making Homework Matter to Students,I tried not to change my method of assessment or how I integrated homework into my lessons. I continued to collect and check homework for completion and accuracy. Students were allowed and encouraged to ask questions about homework ideas as part of daily lessons. Weekly quizzes were used to help determine student progress throughout the unit. ,29,Making Homework Matter to Students
30,Making Homework Matter to Students,"I emphasized that the new homework had fewer problems for them to  complete and that daily assignments were only suggestions; nothing was due until the end of the week. This meant that if they were busy on a given night, they could get it done later in the week. I tried to motivate them by putting more control of the homework into their hands.",30,Making Homework Matter to Students
31,Making Homework Matter to Students,"To foster student cooperation, I told students that they could ask me for help but reminded them that they could also rely on their classmates. On several occasions, I told students that they could work with a partner or in small groups to work out problems at the end of class. The class also engaged in think-pair-share activities to jumpstart thinking and discussion.",31,Making Homework Matter to Students
32,Making Homework Matter to Students,"The new homework problems I  created and assigned were influenced by suggestions obtained from reading  work done by Wieman and Arbaugh (2014); Lange, Booth, and Newton (2014); and Friedlander and Arcavi (2012), all of whom offered advice on particular homework style questions as well as questions to elicit the type of thinking and activity advocated by Smith and Stein (1998).",32,Making Homework Matter to Students
33,Making Homework Matter to Students,"Find and Fix the Mistake Find and Fix the Mistake problems (see fig. 1) were the most commonly used tasks throughout the new homework implementation. Students were instructed to identify the mistake, explain it, and simplify the expressions or solve the equations correctly. One ",33,Making Homework Matter to Students
34,Making Homework Matter to Students,Fig. 6 These students sorted equations by using common characteristics.,34,Making Homework Matter to Students
35,Making Homework Matter to Students,"(a) Connor’s work (b) Mary’s work (c) Jane’s work (d) Debbie’s work advantage of these problems was that they required students to use correct mathematical vocabulary. Jennifer  (see fig. 2) includes the term distribute in her response, which was discussed several times in class. ",35,Making Homework Matter to Students
36,Making Homework Matter to Students,"Connor (see fig. 3) and Kim  (see fig. 4) both demonstrated their procedural knowledge; writing about the problem helped them participate in class discussion. During this time, I found that students were more confident in class discussions when they had had a chance to think before class about these ideas. Rather than just solving the equations with varying levels of procedural fluency, students were thinking more about the problems and how to explain errors. ",36,Making Homework Matter to Students
37,Making Homework Matter to Students,"Students like Donna and Lois (see fig. 5) were improving on their answers and explanations from previous assignments. These two students—as well as others—were also more likely to volunteer their opinions in class when they had their explanations already on paper. This led to better class discussions in that more students engaged with the ideas. From my perspective, Find and Fix the Mistake problems made it clear what students did and did not understand in terms of mathematical procedures and concepts. ",37,Making Homework Matter to Students
38,Making Homework Matter to Students,Problem Sorts,38,Making Homework Matter to Students
39,Making Homework Matter to Students,"Problem Sort questions asked students to sort equations they had already solved into two groups by using common characteristics, such as operations (shown by Connor and Mary’s work in figs. 6a–6b), properties, nature of the solution (shown by Jane in fig. 6c), and so on. The open-ended nature of choosing the sorting criteria made this type of question challenging for students. Quite often I received answers like Debbie’s (see fig. 6d), which appears to show a separation by operation but no explanation. This  type of problem does not seem to exceed the cognitive level of the class, yet its usefulness in helping students better understand solving linear equations remains unclear to me. ",39,Making Homework Matter to Students
40,Making Homework Matter to Students,Create Your Own Word Problem,40,Making Homework Matter to Students
41,Making Homework Matter to Students,"Students were asked to write a story that matched a given equation and expressions; basically, a word problem in reverse (an example is shown in fig. 7). The level of demand for this task  is much greater than those of previous assignments because students must— •   understand how the expressions  relate to the equation; •   determine what the equation is ask- ing; and •   make a meaningful story to go with  the problem. ",41,Making Homework Matter to Students
42,Making Homework Matter to Students,"Unfortunately, the level of demand was evidently too high for students in the class. ",42,Making Homework Matter to Students
43,Making Homework Matter to Students,One determinant of how important  or useful a problem was to students was whether they actually completed the problem. The Create Your Own Word Problem task was one of the most skipped problems in any of the homework assignments. Figure 8 shows that Kim and Connor gave answers that were nearly correct. They both solved the equation correctly but had difficulty in determining the number of cups needed for each ingredient. Kim’s answers for each ingredient did not match the equation. Connor found a solution to the equation but not for each ingredient in the problem.,43,Making Homework Matter to Students
44,Making Homework Matter to Students,"I did notice improvement for some  students as they gained more experience with this type of problem. Figure 9 shows how Jane struggled with the first version of this problem and then a few weeks later how she improved with a different version. Improvement was evident for several students, and ",44,Making Homework Matter to Students
45,Making Homework Matter to Students,Fig. 7 This grid illustrated a word problem in reverse.,45,Making Homework Matter to Students
46,Making Homework Matter to Students,Fig. 8 These students had difficulty determining the number of cups needed for each ingredient.,46,Making Homework Matter to Students
47,Making Homework Matter to Students,"(a) Kim’s work (b) Connor’s work although the level of demand may have been high, the problem was useful in determining students’ understanding and misconceptions of certain types of linear equations.",47,Making Homework Matter to Students
48,Making Homework Matter to Students,Justify Your Reasoning,48,Making Homework Matter to Students
49,Making Homework Matter to Students,"This type of problem is designed to help students analyze why linear equations can have one, none, or infinitely many solutions. The concept of a math  equation not having a solution was a new idea for many of the students at this grade level. This question was asked after students were already solving linear equations that might not have had a solution. ",49,Making Homework Matter to Students
50,Making Homework Matter to Students,"Many students, including Sharon (see fig. 10a), repeated phrases that were discussed in class. Although these statements may be true, students did not offer any justification or evidence that they really understood how the inequality and the no-solution equation were related. Amy (see fig. 10b) also tried to relate the problem directly to class conversation. Like Sharon, Amy may simply be repeating what others have said in class, making it more difficult to perceive individual reasoning. Other students were able to provide some insight into how they viewed the problem. Kim attempted to describe  actions she took to solve these types of problems (see fig. 10c). This does not necessarily demonstrate understanding; rather, it is an observed connection between the process and end result. Connor’s response (see fig. 10d) dug a little bit deeper. Connor was able to explain his answer by talking about how inequalities went with no solutions because the equations were “never true in the first place.” He continued to describe how these equations may initially look like the others but do not hold up under mathematical investigation.",50,Making Homework Matter to Students
51,Making Homework Matter to Students,"Students completed the Justify Your Reasoning problems relatively quickly, and most students attempted them. Allowing students to explain their responses in class helped them to make connections with other students and their ideas.",51,Making Homework Matter to Students

54,Making Homework Matter to Students,POSITIVE PERCEPTION  OF HOMEWORK,54,Making Homework Matter to Students
55,Making Homework Matter to Students,"I feel that these tasks had a positive impact on my students’ perception of homework. A careful selection of homework tasks can help students practice, understand, and explore mathematical concepts. If students  are confused about what a question  is asking or how to begin, they are  not as likely to persevere through  the problem.",55,Making Homework Matter to Students
56,Making Homework Matter to Students,"Teachers and students evaluate  homework questions differently, and they cannot be labeled as simply easy or difficult. The appropriateness of the level of demand of the problem is important when considering what students should gain from completing a task. Questions such as those in Find and Fix the Problem were very popular and successful with students. They had clear expectations, and students were able to determine answers that they thought made sense and were acceptable to them.",56,Making Homework Matter to Students
57,Making Homework Matter to Students,I found the benefits of using this  style of homework to include the following: •   Improved class discussions:  ,57,Making Homework Matter to Students
58,Making Homework Matter to Students,Students were able to explain the mathematical concepts with more confidence and use better vocabulary in the classroom setting.,58,Making Homework Matter to Students
59,Making Homework Matter to Students,•   Teacher insights: Explanations for and justification of the homework problems made it easier for me to determine current levels of understanding as well as notice common misconceptions shared by the class.,59,Making Homework Matter to Students
60,Making Homework Matter to Students,This small change in my homework approach helped me gain information about students’ perception of homework in a different way. Although the process did not determine why some students continu-,60,Making Homework Matter to Students

62,Making Homework Matter to Students,"(a) Sharon’s work (b) Amy’s work (c) Kim’s work (d) Connor’s work ally fail to complete their homework, it did help me see why certain students skip the occasional problem. In working with new homework practices, I learned how important it is for homework to contain an appropriate level of demand. Skills-practice problems are beneficial to students’ math knowledge, but good cognitive problems require students to invoke deeper levels of thinking. I plan to continue to adjust my homework structure to include  skills practice and cognitive thought. Problems with an appropriate level of demand and timely feedback allow students to learn from their homework and be confident that the  work they do outside of class  is meaningful.",62,Making Homework Matter to Students
