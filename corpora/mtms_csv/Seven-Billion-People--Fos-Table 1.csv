Allow me to share a story. ,7,Seven Billion People: Fostering Productive Struggle
8,Seven Billion People: Fostering Productive Struggle,"Driving home from  school one evening, I heard the following statements on the radio. First, the commentator announced that experts had determined that the world population had reached 7 billion people, a statistic that I was willing to accept. However, the second two statements seemed suspicious. The announcer stated that (a) if you laid out all the people on earth end to end, they would circle the earth 266 times; and (b) if all  7 billion people stood shoulder to shoulder, we would all fit into Los Angeles (see fig. 1). I did not believe that either of these statements could possibly be true. As soon as I got home, I went to work verifying these statements, which required making assumptions, performing ",8,Seven Billion People: Fostering Productive Struggle

21,Seven Billion People: Fostering Productive Struggle,"If the struggle were not productive, some may equate this with frustration. Yet mathematics educators agree that students’ productive struggle in the mathematics classroom is a necessary component for learning. For students, this means “struggling at times with mathematics tasks but knowing that breakthroughs often emerge from confusion and struggle” (NCTM 2014, p. 52). In my experience with middle-level mathematics students, they are not aware that learning occurs after struggling. Instead, students frequently expect teachers to minimize confusion and simply model the correct solution strategy.",21,Seven Billion People: Fostering Productive Struggle
22,Seven Billion People: Fostering Productive Struggle,"For teachers, it follows that “effective  mathematics teaching supports students in struggling productively as they learn mathematics” (NCTM 2014, p. 48).

24,Seven Billion People: Fostering Productive Struggle,"If we seek productive struggle in math class, the task needs to lend itself to this by having a high level of cognitive demand. A task with high cognitive demand is often nonroutine, calls for solution strategies that not obvious, invites debate, and will “embody the complexities of real-life situations” (Stein et al. 2009). The Seven Billion People problem has these characteristics (see table 1). ",24,Seven Billion People: Fostering Productive Struggle

26,Seven Billion People: Fostering Productive Struggle,"After choosing a task, often the most difficult part is implementing the task in a manner that encourages students to struggle productively, especially if the students are accustomed to a classroom routine without this expectation. It  takes time to build classroom norms in which mistakes become an accepted part of the problem solving, sufficient time is available to work in groups and discuss possible strategies, and students realize that the teacher is not the sole authority on mathematical justification.

33,Seven Billion People: Fostering Productive Struggle,THE SEVEN BILLION  PEOPLE PROBLEM,33,Seven Billion People: Fostering Productive Struggle
34,Seven Billion People: Fostering Productive Struggle,"To create a classroom experience that fosters productive struggle for my preservice teachers, I assigned the Seven Billion People problem as an in-class task. Sixteen middle-level and elementary preservice teachers who were enrolled in a mathematics methods course at a university worked in groups to solve the problem. They were asked to discuss and present their solution strategies to the class. (From this point on, they will be called “teachers.”)",34,Seven Billion People: Fostering Productive Struggle
35,Seven Billion People: Fostering Productive Struggle,"After reading the problem   aloud, I asked if anyone needed any missing information. As expected, the teachers noted that they needed the circumference of Earth (≈ 24,901 miles), the number of feet in 1 mile (5,280 feet), and the area of Los Angeles (≈ 500 square miles). Some inquired if the people are encircling the earth at the equator (I assumed yes). However, when they asked the average height of a person, I responded that I did not know. Similarly, when they asked how much area one person would consume, I again responded that I did not know. The teachers seemed uncomfortable with the notion that their teacher did not have all the answers. Therefore, I invited them to use any technology available to their group (e.g., smartphones, laptops, tablets) to research the possible answers to their questions and make a reasonable judgment. ",35,Seven Billion People: Fostering Productive Struggle
36,Seven Billion People: Fostering Productive Struggle,"As the teachers worked in groups, the teachers discussed various methods to determine whether they agreed with each statement. Some groups agreed relatively quickly on a reasonable estimate for the height of an average person; other groups got bogged down in their attempts to find the precise average height of a human being. For example, does a statistic on a site represent the height of an average human or an average adult? What percentage of the world’s population are adults? What percentage of the world’s population are children? What about infants? Does height correlate to one’s country of origin, ethnicity, or gender? At this point, I encouraged the groups to reflect on how much precision really is necessary. What assumptions can we make?",36,Seven Billion People: Fostering Productive Struggle
37,Seven Billion People: Fostering Productive Struggle,"I had anticipated a few problem  areas. Not only did some groups spend a long time attempting to estimate the average height of a human, at least one group incorrectly converted square feet to square  miles. Other groups had difficulties interpreting scientific notation on their calculators.",37,Seven Billion People: Fostering Productive Struggle
38,Seven Billion People: Fostering Productive Struggle,"When all groups had had sufficient  time to come to a conclusion, the teachers shared their solution strategies. After some debate, all groups concluded that the two statements of the Seven Billion People problem were reasonable (maybe not exactly true, but at least reasonable).",38,Seven Billion People: Fostering Productive Struggle

40,Seven Billion People: Fostering Productive Struggle,"The following are typical ways in which the teachers solved both parts of the Seven Billion People problem. In each case, the first solution strategy begins with the assumed measure of the average human; the second strategy begins with given information and works backward to find the assumed human measurements. The teachers perceived the second strategy in each case to be more efficient.",40,Seven Billion People: Fostering Productive Struggle

Second, it was evident that the opportunity for group discussions resulted in increased confidence levels and enjoyment. In fact, this experience seemed to convince these teachers that more of these types of tasks should be included in the middle school curriculum, and that even one positive experience with productive struggle can indeed shape students’ dispositions toward problem solving.",74,Seven Billion People: Fostering Productive Struggle
75,Seven Billion People: Fostering Productive Struggle,EXTENSIONS TO  OTHER DISCIPLINES,75,Seven Billion People: Fostering Productive Struggle
76,Seven Billion People: Fostering Productive Struggle,"For further exploration and interdisciplinary resources related to the Seven Billion People problem, consider the following resources (further details are in the References section of this article). NCTM has an online Student Explorations in Mathematics article titled “7 Billion . . . and Growing” (May 2015), in which students use data and statistics to examine how population growth may affect Earth’s resources. The short quiz titled “Quiz: Population 7 Billion—Could We All Fit in One City?” (Gupton 2011) from the National Geographic website is a great way to follow up mathematical problem solving and extend discussions to other subjects, such as social studies, geography, science, and literacy. Furthermore, the last question on the quiz, “In 2011, there were _______ births per minute around the world,” lends itself to a music and mathematics connection. The correct answer is about 266 births per minute. This led me to wonder: How many births is that per second? One can calculate 266 births per minute ÷  60 ≈ 4.4 births per second. Rounding to whole babies, this estimate becomes approximately 4 births per second around the world. (As a side note, an interesting question to pose to your middlelevel students is this: “Given that the population is growing, would the deaths  per second be higher or lower than 4.4?”) Musically, what would 4 births per second sound like if we clapped once for every birth? At a metronome marking of 60 beats per minute (bpm), which is a slow adagio tempo, we would be clapping at the rate of 1 birth per second. (This can easily be done as a class by watching the second hand on an analog classroom clock and clapping once per second.) Increasing to twice that rate, which is a 120 bpm allegro tempo, brings us to 2 claps (i.e., births) per second. Doubling that rate once more brings us to a 240 bpm prestissimo tempo = 4 claps (i.e., births) per second. That represents a lot of babies. Last, one can find similar problems, called Fermi questions, at NCTM’s Math Forum site (e.g., Talamo 1996). A Fermi question, similar to the Seven Billion People problem, is a nonroutine problem that has multiple solution strategies.",76,Seven Billion People: Fostering Productive Struggle

78,Seven Billion People: Fostering Productive Struggle,"Tasks like the Seven Billion People problem provide wonderful opportunities for teachers as well as middle-level students to experience productive struggle. Furthermore, this task supports many of the Common Core’s Standards for Mathematical Practice (SMP) (CCSSI 2010). The solution strategy was not immediately obvious and thus encouraged perseverance (SMP 1); the task inherently lent itself to critiquing the mathematical reasoning of others (SMP 3); and the task required mathematical modeling, where students needed to be “comfortable making assumptions and approximations to simplify a complicated situation” (CCSSI 2010, p. 7). In fact, the Seven Billion People problem also exhibits the three hallmarks of a good task (Murawska and Nabb 2015): (1) the problem solver must decide what mathematics to apply, (2) the task uses real-life (often  messy) data, and (3) the task requires mathematical modeling. With more tasks like this in the middle school curriculum and in preservice teacher education, perhaps we can look forward to more students enjoying productive struggle in their problemsolving experiences.",78,Seven Billion People: Fostering Productive Struggle
