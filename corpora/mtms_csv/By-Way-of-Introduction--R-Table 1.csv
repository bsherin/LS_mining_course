5,By Way of Introduction: Rational Number Sense,"The use of concrete materials is the  basis for a framework for systematic mathematics interventions for ratio reasoning. “Systematic Interventions for Teaching Ratios,” by Amy E. Hunter, Sarah B. Bush, and Karen Karp, illustrates the use of the framework while presenting three meanings of ratios: as multiplicative comparisons, as fractions, and as quotients. Examining different meanings is  also important when learning fraction concepts. Anderson Norton, Jesse L. M. Wilkins, Michael A. Evans, Kirby Deater-Deckard, Osman Balci, and Mido Chang discuss how an app can be used to promote student development of partitive concepts, requiring students to use both partitioning and iterating actions. Read about their exploration in “Technology Helps Students Transcend Part-Whole Concepts.” Jenny Salls in “Sharing Cookies: A Case Study” explores the connection between the operation a ÷ b and the fraction a/b.",5,By Way of Introduction: Rational Number Sense
6,By Way of Introduction: Rational Number Sense,"Division can also be viewed as a  measurement idea. In “How Did the Answer Get Bigger?” Debra I. Johanning and James D. Mamer use a measurement context for student exploration of fraction division. Through the use of modeling and reasoning tools, students explore how a quotient can be larger than the dividend or the divisor. ",6,By Way of Introduction: Rational Number Sense
7,By Way of Introduction: Rational Number Sense,Going beyond the use of a procedure is an important goal when working with fraction comparisons and decimal fraction comparisons. Jennifer M. Tobias discusses teaching strategies to encourage and develop student reasoning when making numerical comparisons in “Mixing Strategies to Compare Fractions.” ,7,By Way of Introduction: Rational Number Sense

10,By Way of Introduction: Rational Number Sense,"For the MTMS Editorial Panel rRational numbers are the building  blocks of mathematics in the middle grades. They are the material from which deep, new mathematical ideas are built and with which novel problems are solved. It is rational number sense that allows students to do this building and solving, which is why rational number representations, meanings, operations, and applications are emphasized in both Principles and Standards for School Mathematics and the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics.

11,By Way of Introduction: Rational Number Sense,"The articles in this 2014 Focus Issue on Rational Number Sense highlight this multifaceted nature of rational numbers and their representation as fractions, ratios, percentages, and decimals. The articles in this issue show how students work with rational numbers in all these forms; they also explore various approaches for meeting the difﬁ culties experienced in teaching and learning the various representations.
