The colorful collection of basic shapes in classic pattern block kits affords opportunities for amazing puzzle-like problem-solving tasks and for exploring underlying mathematical relationships. These visuals can help build  students’ conceptual and procedural understandings of rational numbers (Reimer and Moyer-Packenham 2005). To illustrate the accessibility and challenges of problem solving with pattern blocks at the middle school level, we present increasingly challenging problems. They progress from constructing shapes with given proportions to creating arrangements with given percentage, fractional, and decimal quantities to building seven  completely simplified representations of any given rational number.

32,Revisit Pattern Blocks to Develop Rational Number Sense,"Because students demonstrate  varying skill levels in art and mathematics, it is helpful to assign more challenging arrangement problems as group tasks. Some groups may always build the most basic examples, whereas others may spend a significant portion of the class on one intricate town or flower garden design. During one assignment in our classes for prospective middle school teachers, most groups proudly displayed their pictures consisting of fewer than ten pattern blocks. However, one group used almost all their shapes to construct a detailed rose that covered the entire table. This group’s artistic talents led to an authentic reason to discuss rational number sense and the use of multiplication and/or division to find various equivalent proportions.

35,Revisit Pattern Blocks to Develop Rational Number Sense,"Students working with pattern blocks often discover that there is more than one way to express a given area. For example, the area of a trapezoid is the same as the combination of a rhombus and a triangle. In cases where a set of pattern blocks can be represented by fewer shapes with the same combined area, we say that the set can be simplified. Figure 6 illustrates how the set made of 2 rhombi + 1 trapezoid  can be exchanged for 1 hexagon +  1 triangle. Because the area represented by 1 hexagon and 1 triangle cannot be expressed with fewer blocks, we call this resulting set completely  simplified.

44,Revisit Pattern Blocks to Develop Rational Number Sense,"From our work, we see certain rules emerge. We find that a hexagon is equivalent to 2 trapezoids, 3 rhombi, or 6 triangles. Similarly, a trapezoid is equivalent to 3 triangles or 1 rhombus + 1 triangle. Since the triangle is the smallest shape, it cannot be broken down. We have exhausted the number of completely simplified sets that involve a single shape, but are there any simplifications that consist of multiple shapes? Through more investigation, we can see that we will only add one more grouping to our list, the 1 hexagon +  1 triangle that is equal to the 1 trapezoid + 2 rhombi pairing mentioned in the opening discussion of this section.

46,Revisit Pattern Blocks to Develop Rational Number Sense,"An interesting extension can also promote students’ understanding of rational numbers: The completely simplified sets provide a way to represent any fraction in seven essentially different ways using pattern blocks.

Through problem-solving explorations, we can build students’ rational number sense using four standard pattern blocks.
