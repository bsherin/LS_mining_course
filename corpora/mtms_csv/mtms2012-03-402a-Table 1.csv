"Stacy L. Reeder aAs middle school mathematics becomes more abstract, it is imperative for teachers to introduce concepts in ways that are interesting and meaningful to students. Since my students struggled at times to stay engaged in mathematics and seemed to have diffi culty developing conceptual understanding, I looked for ways to create learning contexts that would be noteworthy and relevant. Working with data seemed to lend itself readily to contexts that were appealing to students. “Middle school students’ curiosity about themselves, their peers, and their surroundings can motivate them to study statistics. The data to be gathered, organized, and studied should be interesting and relevant” (NCTM 1989, p. 105).",5,mtms2012-03-402a,,
"using data are devoid of a context that is meaningful to students, I never worried about leaving the textbook on the shelf and involving my students with data sets that they gathered themselves. To give my students additional experience with measures of central tendency and data collection, I developed an activity that involved making and fl ying paper airplanes. My eighth-grade students were thrilled with this idea and were immediately interested.",6,mtms2012-03-402a,,
"This lesson, which ultimately focused on measures of central tendency, also addressed measurement, scatter plots, and the four main forces of fl ight. The unit began with an engaging conversation about fl ying. The simple question, “How many of you have fl own in an airplane?” resulted in interesting conversations among my  students about the fear of fl ying, the thrill of fl ying, where they have fl own, where they want to travel, and so on. We then discussed making and fl ying paper airplanes, a common adolescent activity. Students shared their ideas about how to fold a good paper airplane and how to make a “trick” paper airplane or one that will fl y “really far.” I then moved the discussion to main forces of fl ight.  setting the stage",7,mtms2012-03-402a,,
"On the fi rst day, I introduced students to the concepts of drag, lift, thrust, and gravity (see fi g. 1) using information from the NASA Education website (http://www.nasa.gov/ audience/foreducators/index.html). Once these concepts were presented, we referred to them as variables that affect fl ight. These terms allowed us to discuss how the use of the term variable in mathematics is similar to, and also somewhat different from, how it is often used in everyday communications and in science. This conversation gave students an opportunity to share their understanding of both independent and dependent ",8,mtms2012-03-402a,,

"After a list of variables was gener- ated, students were divided into groups of three and worked to categorize each item on the list as one of the four types of forces. After working for a few minutes in their groups, students were pulled together to discuss the variables they had identifi ed. Each variable was classifi ed in terms of the four forces that affect fl ight. For example, “things sticking up” was classifi ed as drag, whereas “what paper you use” was classifi ed as weight and also as drag.",11,mtms2012-03-402a,,

"our discussions from the previous day and their prototype paper airplanes. I asked a few students to summarize what we had discussed the day before and asked a few others to share what they learned from working with their prototype. One student had talked with an older brother who could, in his estimation, build “really great paper airplanes” so he learned from him how to construct a good plane. ",24,mtms2012-03-402a,,
"Following this discussion, students were offered three kinds of paper—notebook paper, copier paper, and construction paper—with which to fold a paper airplane for the day’s activities. These paper airplanes were called Unique Planes. During construction, students were allowed to go into the hallway to see where we would be fl ying the paper airplanes so that we could discuss the area to be used once all planes were completed. One strip of masking tape ran down the center and most of the length of the hallway, and another strip of masking tape ran perpendicular to the longer piece, across the width of the hallway. The masking tape formed our landing strip. Also, since our hallway had several doors along one wall and mostly windows along the other wall, all doors and windows were closed to control for gusts of wind or drafts.",25,mtms2012-03-402a,,

"the class returned to the hallway to examine the landing strip where the paper airplanes were scattered on the floor. The students looked at the landing strip and the paper airplanes as a physical representation of our  data and were asked to agree on three words or phrases that would best describe the Unique Plane data. “Spread everywhere,” “scattered,” and “dispersed” were chosen. Students were asked to keep this hallway image in  mind as we returned to the classroom.",47,mtms2012-03-402a,,
"After referencing the class data on the whiteboard, students were asked what they thought we should do first to begin to understand the data set. Many indicated that we should order the data from least to greatest to find the range. We discussed whether we needed to order all the data to determine the range and decided that ordering was unnecessary. We could simply identify the largest and smallest number and determine the range with those two data points. However, the class agreed that ordering the data would be important for general understanding, so they ordered the numbers and checked their work with one another to ensure that they were correct. The ordered data were transferred to an Excel® spreadsheet and projected so that all students could refer to them easily for the remainder of the project. ",48,mtms2012-03-402a,,
"How best to represent the data in a tally chart was the next task. Given that most of the generated data had few, if any, duplicate entries, students immediately suggested that we needed to “clump” the data to create a tally chart because, in their words, “It would seem silly to have thirty different numbers all with one tally mark next to each one.” We ultimately determined that we would create intervals within our data—from 0-10, 11-20, 21-30, and so on—for our tally chart. While students worked in pairs to complete this task, I moved around the room to monitor progress and ask questions. Students were given an activity sheet (see fig. 2) to help complete this task.",49,mtms2012-03-402a,,
"The tally chart was recorded on a large piece of paper and posted in the front of the room so that all students could refer to the same chart during our discussion. To help them develop a conceptual understanding of mean beyond a simple calculation, they were asked to think about what the  mean of our data set might be. They responded that it might be in one of the groups that had the most tallies. To stretch their thinking, I asked if the mean would be found in the bottom interval if the group 0-10 had the most tally marks. This question resulted in a rich discussion on the notion that “it depended on the rest of the data set.”",50,mtms2012-03-402a,,
"Students were asked if anyone’s  paper airplane flew into the end wall of the hallway (“Yes!”) and to think about what might happen to the mean of the data set if the wall constraint was removed. For example, what would happen if the hallway was extended. Students agreed that the mean would go up. When asked what would happen to the mean if the two side walls of the hallway were removed, for example, if we had been in the gym and there were no side barriers, many thought that the mean would go up; others contended it would be pulled down. After some discussion and examples of paper airplanes being able to fly farther away from the landing strip without the side walls, we agreed that we could not predict what would happen to the mean if we removed the boundaries on both sides of the strip.",51,mtms2012-03-402a,,

"On day 3, each group of students shared their calculated results for the mean, median, and mode. Once we agreed on our findings, we discussed whose flight was above and below the mean. I reminded them that our data did not represent how far a paper airplane had flown but rather what we had defined as “accurate.” Following this discussion, I told students that we would be repeating the paper airplane activity with one important differ- ence: We would all be constructing the same version—NASA’s Rocket Plane, considered the “best paper airplane”—and using the same paper. Before folding the Rocket Plane, I asked students to think about the main forces that affect flight and to consider if, by folding the same paper airplane and using the same paper, we could control for more variables. They answered yes. A few of their comments are in figure 3. ",54,mtms2012-03-402a,,
"After considering what variables  would be impacted by all students folding the same paper airplane, we discussed how measures of center might look for the data we would be collecting with the Rocket Planes. Students conjectured that the mean would be higher for this set of data because they were convinced that the paper airplanes would fly farther and in a straight line. The students also agreed that the mode and median would also likely be higher than the mode and median from the previous day’s data for the same reasons. After this discussion, we folded the Rocket Planes.   I projected a copy of the paper- folding directions (see fig. 4), and we worked as a group to fold the paper airplanes. In addition, I modeled each fold, step by step, in front of the class so that we could complete each fold together. This type of folding activity is quite challenging for some students because many do not have a well-developed spatial sense and it can be frustrating.
