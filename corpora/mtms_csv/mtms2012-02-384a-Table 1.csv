The Scoop on Ice Cream,2,mtms2012-02-384a,,
"An ice cream shop offers 30 different flavors in 3 sizes: 1 scoop, 2 scoops, or 3 scoops. The store claims that “over 30,000 different selections are possible.” Let’s explore whether this claim is true. To start, 30 single-scoop  servings are possible.  4.  Suppose the store has only   4 flavors—strawberry, vanilla, chocolate, and mint. How many 3-scoop servings could you make, with 3 different flavors per cone, assuming that order matters? How many of these cones have only strawberry, vanilla, and chocolate? 5.  Assume that the order does not  matter for 3-scoop servings. How can you get the number of 3-scoop servings quickly using your answer from question 4? What is the number of 3-scoop servings in this situation? 6.  If there are only 4 flavors, how  many 3-scoop servings are possible when 2 scoops are 1 flavor and the other scoop is another flavor, assuming that order does not matter? What changes if the order matters? 7.  How many 3-scoop servings are  available altogether (repeating flavors or not) if order matters? If order does not matter?  8.  Challenge: Use the thinking from the previous questions to see if it is possible to make 30,000 different combinations with 30 flavors. ",3,mtms2012-02-384a,,

"1.  For multiple scoops, does the order  in which scoops are put in a cone matter? For example, does a cone with vanilla first and chocolate second differ from one with chocolate then vanilla?  2.  Assume that order matters. If there  were only 8 flavors, how many 2-scoop servings of different flavors can you make? What changes if you assume that the order of the scoops does not matter?  3.  What happens to the number of 2-scoop servings if a serving can be scoops of the same flavor? Does the order count in this type of serving?",5,mtms2012-02-384a,,
