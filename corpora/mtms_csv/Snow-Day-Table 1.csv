Later that day, it starts snowing  again. If 1/2 inch of snow fell each hour for 6 hours during a steady snowfall, how much total snow has accumulated in this series of storms?  3. During a different storm, 12 inches  of snow fell over 5 hours. In a nearby city, 10 inches of snow fell over 4 hours.    a.  Find the rate of snowfall for  each city.    b.

15,Snow Day,FIELD-TEST COMMENTS,15,Snow Day
16,Snow Day,"Snow days do not often occur for sixth-grade prealgebra students in Las Vegas, but students could definitely relate to the concept of procrastination. It was interesting that the relationship between the cartoon and the first problem was not apparent to them. ",16,Snow Day
17,Snow Day,"Several students stated that there  was missing information in question 1. Directing them back to the cartoon and reminding them  that tables, graphs, charts, and cartoons are part of a problem placed them on a path to the solution. They went on to the next question with confidence, only to pause again and ask if there was snow on the ground before the storm, since question 2 asked for total snow accumulation. This led to a discussion about reading too much into questions and overthinking a problem.",17,Snow Day
18,Snow Day,"The rate of change problems were a perfect review. Students were able to complete the table for both cities and graph the snowfall. They were able to interpret the rate of changing snow levels in terms of slope of the lines. Giving a graph a meaningful title, labeling the axes correctly, and identifying the independent and dependent variables are skills that constantly require reinforcement! ",18,Snow Day

22,Snow Day,"I used this activity with my combined class of eighth-grade honors prealgebra and algebra 1 students in May. We were reviewing slope (rates of change) and graphing linear equations, which were covered earlier in the school year. Students worked in small groups of three or four to complete this activity, and they were allowed to use a TI-Nspire CX handheld device. ",22,Snow Day
23,Snow Day,My students asked for clarification with question 2; they wanted to know if any snow had melted between the two snowfalls. Students also asked for clarification in question 3; they wanted to know if the snowstorm in the question was the same as one of the two mentioned in questions 1 and 2. ,23,Snow Day
24,Snow Day,"Overall, this activity provided students the opportunity to review what they had learned earlier in the school year, with the added bonus of “thinking cool thoughts in the middle of May,” as one of my students stated! ",24,Snow Day

28,Snow Day,"My thirteen seventh-grade advanced students found this activity to be rather easy, probably because it is grade level work for them. I did have two students who wanted to provide answers for question 1 using the  2 feet instead of converting to  24 inches because they “read it too quickly.” I also had one student miscalculate the number of hours between 4 p.m. and 8 a.m., causing him to get the wrong answer for number 1.
