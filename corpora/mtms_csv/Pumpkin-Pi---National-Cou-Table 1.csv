69,Pumpkin Pi - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Where were you on Super Pi Day 3/14/15 at 9:26 and 53 seconds? My sixth-grade prealgebra students were obsessed with this once-in-a-century occurrence and proudly shared what they were doing at the time, ranging from math, science, and spelling competitions they were involved in on the weekend to the simple act of eating a slice of pie at that exact moment.",,
70,Pumpkin Pi - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Pumpkin Pi was the perfect introduction to that days unique qualities. The mathematical minds of Jason and Marcus are always inspirational as well as comical. Calculating the ratio was an excellent opportunity to review order of operations using the calculator, as befuddled students tried to analyze their errors. Many neglected to insert parentheses for the fraction, and a few students entered the number 6 2/3 ft. as 6(2/3), realizing afterward that this usage became a multiplication problem rather than addition.",,
71,Pumpkin Pi - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"From 22/7 and 3.14 to Archimedes and the Egyptians estimations of pi, my students enjoyed a slice of mathematical history as we began our geometry unit. Reviewing the area of a circle led into our discussion of the volume of a sphere. We were wondering how Marcus and Jason would tackle that calculation with the same pumpkins.",,

75,Pumpkin Pi - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I gave Pumpkin Pi to my seventh graders during our review before state assessments in April. This was an excellent exercise for the students on the basis of requirements of the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics for seventh grade. Although I had taught the unit on circles the previous fall, many of my students needed a refresher. The first part of the activity, calculating circumference  diameter, helped bring to mind the activities we had done as a class measuring various circles and doing our own ratio calculations.",,
76,Pumpkin Pi - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"With my next class of seventh graders, I will consider breaking up this activity into parts that can be given throughout the topic on circles and measurement. I also plan to extend problem 5 to include the use of the concept of relative error to find out which approximation is closer to  because the concept of relative error is a Grade 7 Common Core State Standard.",,

80,Pumpkin Pi - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Ed. note: After reading the suggestion above, we inserted problem 5b to address the topic of relative error.",,
81,Pumpkin Pi - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I used Pumpkin Pi as an informal assessment with a group of seventh-grade students in a mixed-ability classroom. The students had completed a unit on circle geometry, and the cartoon provided an opportunity to demonstrate their understanding. All students had some success working through questions 1 through 4. Those who had attained mastery were able to answer the questions in articulate, thoughtful ways and quickly moved on to the challenge questions. Questions 5 and 6 were thought provoking and prompted students to use creative problem-solving strategies as they extended their work with pi.",,
82,Pumpkin Pi - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The cartoon format gave this assessment a less formal feeling. The students seemed to enjoy it, and they worked steadily and independently for the time allowed (about 25 minutes).",,

86,Pumpkin Pi - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"For problem 1, I realized that some students in my classes got caught up with the fractions; it distracted them from the goal of finding a pattern among the ratios. In my other two classes, I removed the values in the table and asked the students to measure round objects in centimeters and create their own table. These students did not lose sight of the intent of the problem. I also let them use calculators and extended the problem to ask that they find the average ratio.
