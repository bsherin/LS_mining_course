"Jae Ki Lee, Kyong Mi Choi, and Melissa McAninch rResearch has proved that American  students, as well as some adults, struggle with understanding fraction concepts and operations (Behr et al. 1992; NCES 2011). Having a solid understanding of this topic is important because fraction concepts are a foundation for many areas in secondary school mathematics, such as rate of change, rational expressions, functions, and equations (Son 2011). Researchers have turned to studying instructional approaches of higherperforming countries, comparing written curricula cross-nationally, with the goal of explaining differences in achievement among countries  (Son and Senk 2010; Son 2011; ",2,mtms2012-11-236a,,

"This article’s purpose is not to  compare instructional techniques but instead to propose a new instructional technique that blends ideas from different sources. The L-shaped 2-5-3-7 algorithm combines the efficiency of an L-shaped representation found in Singaporean and Korean mathematics textbooks with a simplified procedure that uses divisibility rules of primes  2, 3, 5, and 7 from U.S. textbooks. From the elementary school to the remedial collegiate level, this representation can help students as they develop procedural skills and understanding of the factorization of numbers and operations of fractions. ",5,mtms2012-11-236a,,
"Part of the problem with fraction  concepts for students in a remedial program is a lack of number sense and fluency with operations. Brown and Quinn (2006) examined the challenges in rational number operations presented for students and found that more than 50 percent of participants did not understand addition or subtraction of fractions. Also found was that 48 percent did not understand multiplication of fractions. Moreover, “twenty-seven percent of students did not correctly reduce the fraction 24/36” (Brown and Quinn 2006, p. 31).

"Procedural fluency is one of the  five strands of mathematical proficiency. It should not be forgotten as teachers strive toward students’ overall understanding. To be procedurally fluent, a student must be able to complete mathematical procedures “flexibly, accurately, efficiently, and appropriately” (NRC 2001, p.116). The instructional hierarchy model proposed by Haring and Eaton (1978) also recognizes the need in mathematics for mastery of computational fluency before more advanced understanding and reasoning, such as that used in problem solving, can occur.

"Through our mathematics teaching  experiences from middle schools and  high schools to community colleges and beyond, we noticed that students struggled with fraction concepts despite myriad instructional methods used by different instructors. We also realized that one strategy did not work for all students, and we were encouraged to develop an alternative approach to help more students understand the areas where difficulties appeared.",8,mtms2012-11-236a,,
"After meeting with students and  volunteering at the mathematics learning center, we realized that the common textbook approaches that fail students are verbose and contain too many steps. Students, especially those who struggle with learning mathematics, simply tried to memorize formulas and procedures to pass the test. In so doing, they did not gain a solid understanding of the concepts.

"The L-Shaped Representation It is hard to say exactly when the  L-shaped representation began, but there is historical evidence of its existence during previous centuries. For example, Quackenbos (1866) introduced it in Practical Arithmetic (p. 73).

"Prime factorization of 60: 60 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 5 = 22 × 3 × 5 prime numbers before fraction concepts. These resources prepare students to use relevant properties and concepts of prime numbers and factorization when dealing with fractions and their operations (see, for example, Bennett et al. 2007; Charles, Crown, and  Fennell 2004). Finding the greatest common factor (GCF) and least common multiple (LCM) are two topics that are closely related to fraction operations and prime factorization.",15,mtms2012-11-236a,,
"The tree diagram approach is one method that U.S. textbooks frequently use in secondary schools and community colleges to teach prime factorization. Figure 1 displays the product of factors of a number in an organized manner. This organization is  also useful for factoring large numbers because it fosters procedural flexibility by offering students choices regarding decomposition into factors. Students can capitalize on certain familiar multiplication facts and build on new ones. For example, many ways are possible to find two factors whose product is 5000, such as 50 × 100, 10 × 500, 25 × 200, and so forth. With various ways to decompose a number, students can flexibly explore a number’s compositions. In turn, a student with solid understanding of a composite number that can be factored in multiple ways would use this method, whereas a student having a hard time finding what number would be a factor of a given composite number might not.

Connecting the L-Shaped Representation to Trees,17,mtms2012-11-236a,,
"The L-shaped algorithm, introduced in some Korean mathematics textbooks, provides a method of factoring. To factor 60, first write the number 60 within the L (see fig. 2). Then divide it by a prime factor, such as 2, 3, or 5, until the quotient turns out to be a prime number. The tree diagram and L-shaped representations are used with a similar procedure. Thus, any L-shaped representation can be converted into a tree representation, whereas a tree representation with more than one branching at a level cannot be converted directly into an L-shaped representation.",18,mtms2012-11-236a,,
"Figure 3 presents examples of finding the GCF and LCM introduced in a Korean middle school  textbook. These examples use the same L-shaped approach to identify prime factors introduced in figure 2. The numbers at the left of the L are common factors of two given numbers. The GCF that is the multiple of all common factors of 12 and 48 is listed on the left of the L: 2 × 2 × 3 = 12. The two numbers (1 and 4) in the end have only 1 as a common factor. Therefore, multiplying all factors including 1 and 4 gives the LCM:  2 × 2 × 3 × 1 × 4 = 48. Note that the tree diagram has to be constructed for each number, but the L-shaped representation allows factoring more than one number simultaneously with an organized display of common factors. The purpose of using this representation with multiple numbers is to find the GCF or the LCM, not to find prime factorizations of the three composite numbers. For some numbers that are relatively prime, this algorithm does not yield any factor other than 1, which indicates that the given numbers are relatively prime. ",19,mtms2012-11-236a,,
One benefit of this representation is that the factors to be multiplied to find the LCM and GCF are displayed ,20,mtms2012-11-236a,,

"(a) gCf of 12 and 48  (b) LCM of 60 and 100 in a way that is more visually meaningful to students. By definition, the LCM of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both; in other words, the LCM is the multiple of numbers on the left of the L, which yields the GCF, and the factors located below the L. Examples are provided in figure 3, where the GCF of 60 and 100 is 2 × 2 × 5 = 20 and the LCM is the multiplication of the GCF and the two remaining factors,  3 and 5: (2 × 2 × 5) × 3 × 5 = 300.",22,mtms2012-11-236a,,
"A drawback to the tree diagram representation is that students may struggle deciding which factors to multiply to find the LCM or GCF. This difficulty occurs because students make a common mistake, such as multiplying the same factors twice. Although the L shape is cognitively challenging because students have to find each factor that is simultaneously common to all the numbers, especially when there are common primes like 7 and 11, a systematic way to find all the common factors will make the process more efficient.",23,mtms2012-11-236a,,
"the 2-5-3-7 seqUence All composite numbers between  1 and 120 are a multiple of at least one of the four primes 2, 5, 3, and 7. However, it could be a case that some remedial mathematics learners have a limited ability regarding number  sense, which causes them to struggle with where to begin to simplify a fraction or find a prime factor of a number. Some students learn procedures to factor or to simplify a fraction but fail to retain such procedures. In turn, they do not gain a conceptual understanding with these procedures. If we scaffold this knowledge using the first four prime numbers (2, 3, 5, and 7), students can use them as a step toward being able to describe any number’s prime factorization. They can also simplify larger numbers by starting with these four primes. ",24,mtms2012-11-236a,,
"Identifying the first four primes is the premise for the 2-5-3-7 algorithm because these numbers are fairly easy for students to work with. Note that instead of being represented in numerical order, the numbers 3 and 5 are switched in this algorithm because students tend to be more familiar with the divisibility rule for 5 than 3. The divisibility rules (see table 1) could be helpful for students who do not have solid number sense to understand and find the reason why the first four prime numbers can be or cannot be a prime factor of a number. ",25,mtms2012-11-236a,,

"Adapted from Akst and bragg 2009, p. 88 up to 120, the 2-5-3-7 algorithm is applicable. Among composite numbers larger than 120, some have a smallest prime factor larger than 7. However, only 61 composite numbers less than 1000 are exceptions to the algorithm. ",31,mtms2012-11-236a,,
"Once students have developed an  initial understanding of factorization with simpler, smaller numbers, students would be expected to generalize and extend the algorithm with any complex, larger number. As students start to understand and become fluent in using basic algorithms, factorization techniques using prime numbers larger than 7 should be addressed, and the 2-5-3-7 sequence can be expanded.",32,mtms2012-11-236a,,
the l-shaped 2-5-3-7 strategy and applications,33,mtms2012-11-236a,,
The L-shaped 2-5-3-7 algorithm combines the L shape with the  2-5-3-7 sequence. The aim is to scaffold and create an efficient strategy that is easy for students to use in solving problems with fractions. This algorithm provides a simple graphic  organizer and easier steps to follow for fraction operations that neither the L-shaped representation nor the 2-5-3-7 sequence could provide alone. We propose the L-shaped 2-5-3-7 algorithm as an efficient way to obtain the GCF and LCM and to construct prime factorizations to the point to procedural fluency. The procedural fluency resulting from the use of this algorithm will provide the foundation for work with factorization and fraction operations. ,34,mtms2012-11-236a,,

"The multiple of the numbers on the left of the L is the GCF, and the product of the numbers on the left and below the L is the LCM.

Simplifying a Fraction,42,mtms2012-11-236a,,
"Let’s take a look at an example of simplifying a fraction, specifically, 24/36 (see fig. 5). To start, write the fraction in L, and write 2-5-3-7 on  the left of the L, vertically. Since 2 and 3 at the bottom of the L are prime to each other, and the order of the numerator and the denominator are set in the beginning, the simplified form of 24/36 is 2/3.

"Teachers need to be mindful of the purpose for each instructional strategy and use the tool that best suits their  purposes.

Flexibility may be more desirable when a student is exploring factorization and equivalent fractions, learning why different factors produce the same product or why two fractions are equivalent. However, systematic methods may work better for students who need improvement with fluency as they develop speed and accuracy with solving problems (knowing how to solve problems involving factorization of numbers or operations with fractions). As discussed earlier, both conceptual and procedural knowledge are important for learning, and teaching tools may serve as outlets for achieving both kinds of knowledge in different ways.
