Developing the Common Denominator Fraction Division Algorithm,1,mtms2012-11-248a,,
Andrew M. Tyminski and James K. Dogbey,2,mtms2012-11-248a,,
"Fraction division is a topic that is often troublesome for both middlegrades students and preservice teachers. One of our goals in working with all levels of mathematics students is to help them understand that math makes sense and that there are reasons for the procedures and algorithms we use. As the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics suggests, a critical area of study for grade 6 students should be to “use the meaning of fractions, the meanings of multiplication and division, and the relationship between multiplication and division to understand and explain why the procedures for dividing fractions make sense” (CCSSI 2010, p. 39).",3,mtms2012-11-248a,,
This sentiment was echoed in  “Why Don’t We Just Divide Across?” (Newton and Sands 2012). The authors presented an alternative to the traditional invert-and-multiply fraction division algorithm. Their article describes an approach that poses such fraction division number sentences as 21 15 ÷ =÷ = ?,4,mtms2012-11-248a,,
"Readers are encouraged to submit manuscripts through http://mtms.msubmit.net.  and asks students to take an intuitive approach when solving them. Through this approach, students develop an algorithm for dividing across fractions. We present yet another approach to developing the common denominator algorithm: division story problems. We have used this story problem activity extensively with our elementary and middle-grades preservice teachers. Our teachers, in turn, have used it in their classrooms with students. We share some examples of how it was used in our mathematics class for preservice elementary teachers. Thus, the word “students” refers to the preservice teachers in our class.

THE COMMON DENOMINATOR DIVISION ALGORITHM,6,mtms2012-11-248a,,
"To help students discover and develop the common denominator algorithm, we posed a series of problems set within the context of fraction division. Within this meaning of division, students interpreted the number sentence 24 ÷ 6 as “How many groups of 6 are in a set of 24?” The students, who worked in groups of four or ﬁ ve, were asked to use diagrams, pattern blocks, or other representations of their choosing to model and solve the ﬁ rst three problems on the activity sheet. ",7,mtms2012-11-248a,,
"They were then to write explanatory number sentences linking the story problem and their solution method. All the groups used a similar strategy when solving the ﬁ rst three tasks on the activity sheet. They represented the “whole” in the problem and then subdivided it into the size pieces they needed. They then determined how many groups could be made from the material they had. For example, question 1 asked students to determine the number of 3/4 pint servings in 6 pints of ice cream. The students drew 6 rectangles to represent the 6 pints of ice cream. Next, since they were counting 3/4 pint servings, they divided every pint into 4 equal pieces (fourths) and counted groups of 3 pieces until they could not make any more groups of 3. It turned out that 8 of these 3/4 pint servings can be made from 6 pints of ice cream (see ﬁ g. 1a). Students labeled each group of 3 pieces with the same number. This method of labeling the groups in some manner was common across groups, although some students colored or shaded the groups to show the different groups in the whole.",8,mtms2012-11-248a,,
"Question 2 on the activity sheet,  involving 1 1/3 gallon tanks from a total of 4 gallons, was solved in a similar  manner (see ﬁ g. 1b). Students were able to determine that four 1 1/3 tanks could be made. ",9,mtms2012-11-248a,,
"In question 3, students had to  determine the number of 3/4 cup servings that were in 4 1/2 cups of juice. They drew rectangles to represent the 4 1/2 cups of juice (see ﬁ g. 1c) and used shading to represent the last rectangle with 1/2 cup. When students realized that they had to count groups of 3/4 cups, they divided each 1/2 cup piece (black lines) in half to make fourths (red lines). They found that six 3/4 cup servings could be made.",10,mtms2012-11-248a,,
"Most groups of students were able  to recognize the story problems as relating to division and could write the number sentences that parallel the ﬁ rst three tasks: ÷ =÷ = 1÷ =1÷ =14 1÷ =1 14 8, 4 , and 4 ÷ =÷ = , respectively.",11,mtms2012-11-248a,,
"Students became confused when  they had to write number sentences to explain their thinking. We then asked them once again to describe with drawings the process for solving question 1. One student explained that she began by dividing each of the 6 pints into 4 equal pieces. We called her attention to the 6 in her original number sentence and asked her the size of each of the smaller rectangles in her diagram (1/4 pint), and how many of those small rectangles (24) are in her diagram. With these prompts, she realized that she had represented 6 pints as 24/4 pints. After this exchange, students were able to write number sentences that described their diagrams (see ﬁ g. 2). ",12,mtms2012-11-248a,,
"Next, the activity sheet directed students to collect and organize the number sentence data and to write whatever patterns they saw. Students noticed the following patterns:  1.  The denominators in the modiﬁ ed  number sentences are the same. ",13,mtms2012-11-248a,,

"After allowing time for a class discussion of the patterns, students were asked to make an algorithmic conjecture about a rule or procedure they  could use to divide two fractions. One group made this suggestion:   To divide two fractions, ﬁ rst change both numbers to improper fractions (if needed) and make sure they have the same denominators. To ﬁ nd the answer, divide the numerators.",21,mtms2012-11-248a,,
TESTING AND REFINING OUR CONJECTURE,22,mtms2012-11-248a,,
"Once the class had agreed on an initial conjecture, students tested it by solving question 7, which involved ",23,mtms2012-11-248a,,

They were ﬁ rst to apply our algorithm and then check their solution by drawing a picture. This task raised questions and concerns from the students. The number sentence for this question is ÷ =÷ = ?,27,mtms2012-11-248a,,
"Applying our algorithm, the students solved the problem as: 181181 ÷ =÷ = 18",28,mtms2012-11-248a,,
"When students solved the task using models, however, different results occurred. Students were able to draw 3 3/5 feet of wood, subdivide the unit into ﬁ fths, and then count groups of 4/5, as seen in ﬁ gure 3. The misunderstanding occurred as they tried to interpret the remainder. From the diagram, it was clear to the students that 4 shelves could be made and that  4 4 3 3 3 4 4 4 2/5 was leftover, so they wrote their answer as 4 2/5 and claimed that the conjecture did not hold true.",29,mtms2012-11-248a,,
"When a student insisted that the answer must be 4 2/5, the instructor asked her to explain what 4 represented in her answer. She said it was the number of shelves that could be made. When asked what 2/5 represents, she realized the fraction was not expressed in terms of shelves but in terms of feet of wood. We then asked how many of the small rectangles were needed to make a shelf (4) and how many were leftover (2). She could see that the 2 leftover rectangles represented half a shelf. When asked. “How much of a shelf can be made?” she was now convinced that the correct answer was indeed 4 1/2.",30,mtms2012-11-248a,,
"After completing this task, the  students discussed and agreed on the following revised algorithm:  and make sure they have the same denominators. Divide the numerators and divide the denominators (which will be 1). The answer will be the quotient from the numerators. ",31,mtms2012-11-248a,,
"To test our new conjecture, the students completed question 9 (how many 5/6 yard pieces are in 3 2/3 yards), ﬁ rst by using the algorithm and then validating their answer by drawing. After using the algorithm and making drawings (see ﬁ g. 4), they decided correctly that the answer was 4 2/5. ",32,mtms2012-11-248a,,
WRAPPING THINGS UP,33,mtms2012-11-248a,,
"At the end of the activity, we discussed mathematical validity as a class and engaged in a more formal explanation of why this algorithm works. Although we would not ask elementary or middlegrades students to prove this algorithm, it is important that our preservice teachers understood that it was valid in all cases. We explained the validity of the common denominator algorithm using a meaning of division as a missing factor. Our course textbook offers the following deﬁ nition of division of fractions (Long, DeTemple, and Millman 2012, p. 308):  s whe",34,mtms2012-11-248a,,

"We encouraged our students to use this deﬁ nition and try to validate our algorithm. Students were able to represent our written conjecture symbolically as ÷ =÷ =÷÷ =÷ c  To divide two fractions, ﬁ rst change both numbers to improper fractions (if needed) ",36,mtms2012-11-248a,,
"We reasoned that according to the deﬁ nition of division of fractions, this conjecture would be true if and only if = ×= ×",37,mtms2012-11-248a,,
