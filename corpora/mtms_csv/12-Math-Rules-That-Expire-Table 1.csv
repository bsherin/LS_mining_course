0,12 Math Rules That Expire in the Middle Grades - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Many rules taught in mathematics classrooms expire when students develop knowledge that is more sophisticated, such as using new number systems. For example, in elementary grades, students are sometimes taught that addition makes bigger or subtraction makes smaller when learning to compute with whole numbers, only to find that these rules expire when they begin computing with integers (Karp, Bush, and Dougherty 2014). However, middle-grades students, especially those who are struggling, often try to force-fit the rules that they remember from the elementary grades to new concepts or skills.",,
1,12 Math Rules That Expire in the Middle Grades - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In this article, we present 12 persistent rules that expire. These are rules that we have found prevalent in our many years of working with students, from mathematics education literature, or in some cases, rules that we ourselves have taught and later regretted. In each case, we offer mathematically correct and more helpful alternatives.",,

8,12 Math Rules That Expire in the Middle Grades - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,4. 8 = 2x + 20,,
9,12 Math Rules That Expire in the Middle Grades - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Which of these equations would your students choose to solve first or find the easiest? In our work, we found that students were comfortable solving equations 1 and 3 because they looked normal with the operation first (on the left side), followed by the answer (on the right side). Students often hesitated at equations that were similar to 2 and 4 because the perceived operation and answer were arranged in a seemingly reversed order (see table 1). This inflexibility can be linked to the idea that middle school students often have yet to interpret and understand the equal sign as a symbol indicating a relationship between two quantities (Mann 2004). Additionally, students may think that the solution to an equation always goes on the right side of the equal sign. These overgeneralizations are not helpful and can have a negative impact on students conceptual understanding. We suggest that these students are experiencing rules that expire (Karp, Bush, and Dougherty 2014).",,

11,12 Math Rules That Expire in the Middle Grades - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We highlight rules sometimes used with middle school students that seem to hold true at the moment, given the content the student is learning at that time. However, students will later find that these rules expire. Sometimes taught as shortcuts with content that students learned in the previous grades, these rules expire when students use them inappropriately with more advanced problems and find that they are incorrect. Such experiences can be frustrating and can promote the belief that mathematics is a mysterious set of tricks and tips to memorize rather than concepts that relate to one another. For each rule that expires, we do the following (similar to Karp, Bush, and Dougherty 2014):",,

18,12 Math Rules That Expire in the Middle Grades - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"When learning to divide fractions, students are sometimes taught to KFC (Keep-Flip-Change) or told Yours is not to reason why, just invert and multiply. Although both versions align with the standard algorithm, students might overgeneralize this rule to other operations with fractions. Additionally, these mnemonics and sayings do not promote conceptual understanding, making it challenging for students to apply them in a problem-solving context. Instead, division of fractions can be linked to whole-number division by asking how many groups of the divisor make up the dividend. Although students will eventually use the algorithm, they should gain a conceptual understanding of dividing fractions through the use of physical models (Cramer et al. 2010) or other methods, such as the common denominator strategy.

21,12 Math Rules That Expire in the Middle Grades - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Sometimes students are taught to create a factor rainbow to list all factors of a number. For example, if finding the factors of 20, students would write 1 and 20, then 2 and 10, and 4 and 5 (see fig. 1). The rule is taught so that once you identify factors that are consecutive numbers (e.g., 4 and 5), you have identified all factors. However,factors can be missed with this approach. Some numbers do not have consecutive factor pairs, as in when finding the factors of 40: 5 and 8 are the closest factors. Moreover, this rule expires when factoring a square number (its factors are not all paired) or when working with non-whole-number factors, such as in algebra when students factor out fractional parts as well as variables.

For example, |4| = 4 because you drop the negative sign. Confusion sets in when students are presented with |4| because they are unsure what this represents. How can absolute value be negative?

26,12 Math Rules That Expire in the Middle Grades - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Considering multiplication as only repeated addition can result in students thinking that the expression 33 is equivalent to 3 + 3+ 3. This thinking leads to overgeneralizations because students come to believe that 3 raised to the third power means that 3 is used as an addend 3 times. Writing such expressions in correct expanded form can help with this misunderstanding.,,

30,12 Math Rules That Expire in the Middle Grades - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Students incorrectly believe that they should always do multiplication before division, and addition before subtraction, because of their order in the mnemonic (Linchevski and Livneh 1999), instead of performing them in the order in which they appear in the expression.",,

34,12 Math Rules That Expire in the Middle Grades - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The P in PEMDAS suggests that parentheses are first, but this should also represent other grouping symbols, including brackets, braces, square root symbols, and the horizontal fraction bar.

36,12 Math Rules That Expire in the Middle Grades - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Students are often taught that the variable and/or operation comes first, followed by the answer (e.g., the constant) in an algebraic equation (Dougherty and Foegen 2011). However, this rule has no mathematical necessity because the equal sign indicates that two quantities are equivalent. Therefore, variables, operations, and constants can be located on either or both sides of the equal sign. Instead of overgeneralizing that an equation should look a certain way, we as teachers should promote flexibility in students thinking. When the teacher uses a specified set of steps and the placement of the solution in that format, students lose sight of the conceptual aspects of equations and instead focus on implementing algorithmic steps.

42,12 Math Rules That Expire in the Middle Grades - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"However, this rule is problematic for several reasons. First, it does not foster conceptual understanding of the numerical value of fractions because it removes the need to understand the relationship between the two fractions or consider the quantities they represent. Second, students begin to overgeneralize and incorrectly apply this rule to other situations whenever they see two fractions, such as when they add, subtract, multiply, or divide fractions.",,

47,12 Math Rules That Expire in the Middle Grades - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"This rule may be taught when students learn about multiplication and division of integers and is used to help students quickly determine the sign of the product or quotient. However, this rule does not always hold true for addition and subtraction of integers, such as in 5 + (3) = 8. Additionally, this rule does not foster the understanding of why the product or quotient of two or more integers is negative or positive.

49,12 Math Rules That Expire in the Middle Grades - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,10. Use keywords to solve word problems.,,
50,12 Math Rules That Expire in the Middle Grades - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"A keyword approach is frequently introduced in the elementary grades and extends throughout a students school career as a way to simplify the process of solving word problems. However, using keywords encourages students to overgeneralize by stripping numbers from the problem and using them to perform a computation outside the problem context (Clement and Bernhard 2005). This removes the act of making sense of the actual problem from the process of solving word problems. Many keywords are common English words that can be used in many different ways. Often a list of words and corresponding operations are given so that word problems can be translated into a symbolic, computational form. For example, students are told that if they see the word of in a problem, they should multiply all the numbers given in the problem. Likewise, although the keyword quantity sometimes signifies the need for the distributive property, at other times it does not. Keywords are especially troublesome in the middle grades as students explore multistep word problems and must decide which keywords work with which component of the problem. Although keywords can be informative, using them in conjunction with all other words in the problem is critical to grasping the full meaning.",,

However, students overgeneralize this as being true for all situations involving variables, yet this rule quickly expires as variables take on other meanings, such as varying quantities or parameters (e.g., y = mx + b), labels (A = bh), or generalized unknowns. Additionally, students may not accept equations that represent identities (such that the variable can take on any value) or equations that have no solution (such as 3x + 4 = 3x  4).

Although this rule works for binomials, it soon expires as students begin multiplying other polynomials, such as a binomial and a trinomial, or two trinomials.
