"Piecewise linear functions and story graphs are concepts usually associated with algebra, but in our classroom, we found success teaching this topic in a distinctly geometrical manner. The focus of the approach was less on learning geometric concepts and more on using spatial and kinetic reasoning. It not only supports the learning of (what is now called) algebra but also recasts algebraic concepts and ideas in geometric terms. The classroom activity we describe was infl uenced by the Connected Mathematics Project middle school textbook Variables and Patterns  signed technology-based support using The Geometer’s Sketchpad®.",5,mtms2011-02-346a,,
approaching it geoMetrically,6,mtms2011-02-346a,,
"The geometric approach we describe encompassed three important features. The fi rst feature consisted of helping students interpret graphs qualitatively as visual images, before measuring or calculating the slopes. Studies have shown that students often have diffi culty interpreting graphs and make mistakes when representing  backward motion (negative slope) and no motion (zero slope) (see, for example, Lobato and Siebert 2002). We hypothesize that this diffi culty relates to how students were fi rst introduced to the process of slope, in which it is calculated by fi nding the ratio of the rise over the run. ",7,mtms2011-02-346a,,
"Our geometric approach involved  working with slope as if it were an object, that is, as a line with a certain degree of steepness. (See Sfard 1991 for a discussion of the process-object distinction of slope.) Using such an object conception of slope, it was  possible to qualitatively interpret and produce story graphs, focusing particularly on various degrees of motion (moving slowly, going quickly, stopping, and going backward slowly or quickly). ",8,mtms2011-02-346a,,
"The second feature included  working methodically with diagrams. Drawing diagrams can be an important mediator between embodied experiences and mathematical abstractions. Our goal in asking the students to create diagrams was to help evoke the mathematical components of the story that would be worth representing, and to look at the range of techniques that could be used to represent them. The diagrams that students drew would then also be essential in interpreting and creating graphs corresponding to specific stories. Our geometric approach required specific attention to the drawing hand, in keeping with Pederson’s (1983) characterization of geometry as being “a skill of the eyes and the hands as well as of the mind” (p. 159).",9,mtms2011-02-346a,,
"The third feature entailed the  use of dynamic geometry software. Sketchpad was used to introduce the Cartesian coordinate system and to provide a link between the static graph and the temporal story. This coordinated representation would allow students to interpret the motion of the character in the story in terms of the visual components of the graph, so that ideas of speed, time, and distance could be associated with specific aspects of the image.

"The following section provides an overview of the task that was designed for eighth-grade students who had not yet been introduced to the ideas of formulating slope, plotting functions, or interpreting graphs.  developing representations",11,mtms2011-02-346a,,
"To open the activity, we read the following story aloud: ",12,mtms2011-02-346a,,
Our goal in asking  the students  to create diagrams was to help evoke the mathematical components of  the story.,13,mtms2011-02-346a,,
" Lissy walked to the corner store, which was less than a mile from her house. She got about halfway there and stopped to pick up a penny. She looked at it for a while. Then she started walking toward the corner store again, faster than before, to make up for lost time.",14,mtms2011-02-346a,,
We asked the students to represent the story in a visual way. Our goal was to encourage them to use their own ways of representing aspects of the story and to evoke the mathematical aspects of these stories that would be needed to make and interpret a Cartesian graph. Students were invited to share their work with the class. ,15,mtms2011-02-346a,,
We guided the class discussion by focusing attention on aspects of the drawings that were mathematically relevant. We have chosen three examples that highlight some of the ways in which students illustrated different aspects of the story. We also describe some of the mathematical features of the drawings that we discussed in class.,16,mtms2011-02-346a,,
"The first example (see fig. 1a)  shows a representation that focuses on the scenic details of the story, including a winding road, trees, a house and store, and Lissy’s joy at finding a penny. Lissy is shown halfway between the house and store, which  follows the mathematics of the story. The second example (see fig. 1b) is a more schematized representation; the road is represented with a line segment, and the house and store are drawn with much less detail. The distance between the house and store is represented in words, as well as the different walking speeds of Lissy. The difference in Lissy’s speed, shown in the bottom diagram, is represented with short parallel line segments that are used to represent faster walking. ",17,mtms2011-02-346a,,
"The third example (see fig. 1c)  divides the story into four parts, each represented on a line segment. Where time was represented in figure 1b with “? min,” figure 1c uses four clocks to show that the total journey took about thirty minutes and that the second part of the journey took less time than the first. ",18,mtms2011-02-346a,,
"During the class discussion, we asked students to consider which mathematical and nonmathematical aspects of the story were captured in their visual representations. They agreed that the color of Lissy’s hair, the design of the house, and the winding shape of her walking path were not mathematical. These salient aspects of math—time, location, speed, and distance—were important. We also identified the specific graphical symbols that had been used, such as the lines behind Lissy, signifying running, and the clock. Both were used to represent relative speed.",19,mtms2011-02-346a,,
introducing the  cartesian systeM,20,mtms2011-02-346a,,
"We opened a file in Sketchpad, depicting Lissy’s trip to the store. A character moving along a path was shown as part of a piecewise linear function on the coordinate system (see fig. 2). When a user pressed “Go!” Lissy moved along the linear path in the manner of the story while a corresponding point traced the piecewise linear function. The students watched  this motion several times, with much pleasure and anticipation. ",21,mtms2011-02-346a,,
"We explained that the representation they were seeing was a Cartesian graph, which students remembered using when plotting points. We drew attention to some features of the graph, including the x-axis and y-axis, and how they represent time and distance, respectively. We then asked students to work in pairs to respond to the following prompt:   Describe how the features of the graph (the axes, the slopes, and the points) correspond to the story of Lissy’s walk. ",22,mtms2011-02-346a,,
"Students spent about five minutes working in pairs and then reported their findings to the class. In addition to noticing that the “Start” position corresponds to the beginning of Lissy’s travels and that the “Stop” corresponds to the end, the students also pointed out that the axes were being used to represent elapsed time and distance.",23,mtms2011-02-346a,,
"They also noticed the three different slopes. Using what they knew about the story, they were able to talk about the relationship between the slope of the line and the speed of Lissy (using words such as slant, slope, and steepness). ",24,mtms2011-02-346a,,
The following description was representative of students’ written statements: ,25,mtms2011-02-346a,,
"The graph corresponds with Lissy’s walk because the first slope line up is representing how fast she’s going. When the line is flat, it represents that she’s stopped. When the slope gets steeper, it shows she speeds up.",26,mtms2011-02-346a,,
One student articulated the relationship between the slope and the axes: ,27,mtms2011-02-346a,,
The x-axis is the point in time. The y-axis is the point in distance. The ,28,mtms2011-02-346a,,

Fig. 2 Sketchpad allowed students to coordinate moving the character with the location on the graph for the fi nding-a-penny story.,36,mtms2011-02-346a,,
Some students also noted the relationship between the line’s steepness and Lissy’s speed: ,37,mtms2011-02-346a,,
Steep slope is where she goes faster.,38,mtms2011-02-346a,,
The fl at part is where she stops and the gradual part is where she’s walking.,39,mtms2011-02-346a,,
"While Lissy slowly walks, the slope isn’t very steep, but once it gets to the middle straight line, she stops to pick up the penny. Once it gets steeper she tends to go faster.",40,mtms2011-02-346a,,
"These understandings were achieved purely at the visual level by students’ coordinating their knowledge of the story with the elements of the graph. As they discussed the different aspects of the graph, we reminded students of the devices they had used in their own graphical representations. After highlighting the important aspects of the graph, we compared the way in which the coordinate graph could represent both time and distance with the relationship between them, namely, speed. ",41,mtms2011-02-346a,,
"We wanted students to see connections between the coordinate graph and their own graphical representations but also to appreciate the precision and generality of the coordinate graph. We highlighted the way in which speed “came for free” as it was expressed in terms of the slope of the line. Thus, without worrying so much about how to calculate slope, the students were developing a visual sense of how slope was related to different speeds of walking, including stopping.",42,mtms2011-02-346a,,

She went back to get it, stopped to catch her breath, and then ran all the way to the corner store.  involved in the story. Many seemed quite intrigued that Lissy’s return to pick up her hat created a “downward” slope in the corresponding part of the piecewise linear function.",46,mtms2011-02-346a,,
Students were given a third story: ,47,mtms2011-02-346a,,
"Once again, they watched Lissy’s coordinated motion and the accompanying graph several times on the computer and then were asked to identify the different types of motion   Lissy ran toward the corner store as quickly as possible, but had to slow down about halfway there because she was out of breath. Then she walked the last part. ",48,mtms2011-02-346a,,

Students were then asked how they  would have to adjust two points on the line graph shown in fi gure 4 to make the graph fi t the following story: ,52,mtms2011-02-346a,,
Students were asked whether or not a given graph (see fi g. 3) fi t the story and to explain their answers. One explanation was as follows: ,53,mtms2011-02-346a,,
"No, nowhere in the story it says she goes back in distance, also, she began with a fast speed, but slows down, and the last part should be slower than the beginning speed because she was going as quickly as possible, then walked for the last part.",54,mtms2011-02-346a,,
"All but one student, who was fi nally convinced by his classmates, correctly determined that the graph did not fi t the story. Students were able to inter-",55,mtms2011-02-346a,,
"Students often have difﬁ culty  interpreting graphs and make mistakes when representing backward motion and no motion.  in Sketchpad, we invited students to draw the new graph. This was the fi rst time they were asked to produce their own graphs. Although the graphs differed in terms of the details that were given (the axes, the scaling, and so on), students were successful at producing appropriate segments with relative slopes of the piecewise linear function. Next, a student was invited to the computer to drag points 1 and 2 (see fi g. 4) to the correct locations. ",56,mtms2011-02-346a,,
"Finally, students were given a graph  (see fi g. 5) and asked to write a story to fi t. This graph contained a short period of time at the beginning in which no distance was covered. The students were given about fi ve minutes to write their stories and present them to the class, one of which follows:   One day the tortoise and the rabbit had a race. The tortoise put some sticky glue on the rabbit’s feet so that he couldn’t move. The rabbit then dashed 2/3 of the way and fell asleep. When he woke up, he noticed that the tortoise was way ahead of him, so he tried to dash to the fi nish line.",57,mtms2011-02-346a,,
"Lissy walked very slowly toward the corner store. She stopped at a bench down the street for a rest, then ran the rest of the way to the corner store.",58,mtms2011-02-346a,,
Instead of actually moving the points ,59,mtms2011-02-346a,,
"At the end of the activity, we asked students to create their own stories and invited the students, in pairs, to create the graphs on the computer in real time. One student read his or her story while another operated the software ",60,mtms2011-02-346a,,

The students were enthusiastic  about this real-time graphing activity and about the creative stories being offered. We were surprised that they no longer asked for the linked representation of the graph with Lissy in motion and inferred that they had gained suffi cient confi dence in being able to interpret both the graphs and the stories.,67,mtms2011-02-346a,,
"In a quiz given the following week,  the students were asked to draw a graph to match a new story and then write a story to correspond with a (different) given graph. More than three-fourths of the fi fty-two students were able to answer both questions completely. One student made this comment while handing in the quiz: ",68,mtms2011-02-346a,,

reFlections,70,mtms2011-02-346a,,
"Given the diffi culty that students often have in interpreting graphs, we found that our geometrical approach to this algebraic task enabled students to be highly successful. Our approach comprised these three components:  1.  Spending time developing a  graphical representation before turning to the Cartesian coordinate system;  2.  Coordinating the actual motion  with the static representation in Sketchpad to help students understand how line segments corresponded to the elements of the story; and  3.  Exploring the geometric interpretation of slope in which the speed was related to the relative steepness of the line instead of to an algebraic formula. ",71,mtms2011-02-346a,,
"With some minor adjustments, this geometric approach would also work when introducing students to linear graphs and their intercepts or to quadratic graphs.",72,mtms2011-02-346a,,
" Given these foundations, our next  step was to introduce the algebraic processes used to fi nd numerical values for slope, then build toward the equations of lines. Again, this was accomplished by starting with the dynamic imagery provided by the software. First, we constructed a line through the origin and measured its slope. By rotating that line around the origin, we generated a large sample space of different slope values. We then calculated the equation of the line on the computer. By dragging the entire line (to keep the slope constant while changing the value of the intercept), the students could directly see the linked geometric and algebraic variation of the line. Only then did we introduce the rise-over-run interpretation of slope. ",73,mtms2011-02-346a,,
"If mathematician Thom (1973) is  correct in asserting that geometry is long on meaning and short on syntax and that algebra has a lot of syntax but no meaning, then we expect that when it comes time to work algebraically, the students will have the images and drawings in mind that they need.
