"Many schools place a decal of their school mascot at the center of their basketball court. Score Connects is a company that creates mascot decals for schools. To do so, the company needs to work within the size of a middle school basketball court, which is  74 feet × 42 feet. All courts have a  center circle that is 12 feet in diameter.

"2.  What will be the area and circumference of a decal that completely covers the center circle? 3.  Inside the center circle of the middle school court is another circle sharing the same center but whose diameter is 1/3 that of the center circle. What is the ratio of the area of the center circle to the smaller, inside circle? 4.  A school wants a circular decal  that will cover 1/2 the area of the middle school basketball court.  Is it possible? If so, what is the radius of the circular logo? ",9,mtms2010-08-64a,,

"As a review, ask students to explain the meaning of radius, diameter, circumference, and area of a circle. To review the layout of a basketball court, see http://www.halfcourtsports.com/",11,mtms2010-08-64a,,

"1.  Students can find the area of the basketball court and subtract the area of the decal. The area of the decal is (12)2p ≈ 452.39 ft.2.  is calculated by 12p ≈ 37.70 ft. The radius is 12/2, or 6, feet, so the area of a decal that would cover the center circle is calculated by (62)p ≈ 113.10 ft.2.  3.  The radius of the smaller circle is   6 × (1/3) = 2 and its area is  (22)p ≈ 12.57 ft.2.    The ratio of the larger area to the smaller area of the smaller circle is  a.  Since the middle school court   113.10/12.57 ≈ 9:1.  is 74 × 42 = 3108 ft.2, 452.39/3108 means that  approximately 14.56% of the floor is covered by the decal.    b.  100 – 14.56 = 85.44% of the  middle school court is not covered by the decal.",13,mtms2010-08-64a,,
"2.  Since the diameter of the center  circle is 12 feet, the circumference    Students can also see that for any  radius r,  4.  The area of the middle school  court is 74 × 42 = 3108 ft.2, so half the area is 3108/2 = 1554 ft.2. Set  1554 square feet to the area of the decal with the equation 1554 = pr² and find the value of the radius by taking the square root of 1554/π. The radius is approximately 22.24 feet. Since the smaller dimension of the middle school court is 42 feet, the radius of the largest decal that would fit is half that dimension, or 21 feet. Therefore, the request is unreasonable, because a logo with radius 22.24 feet would not fit within the width of the court. ",14,mtms2010-08-64a,,
"To challenge students, a teacher can ask what the greatest ratio is between the area of the decal and the area of the court. This ratio can be calculated by choosing 21 as the radius for the logo and calculating both areas.  2 0 1 0 NCTM",15,mtms2010-08-64a,,
