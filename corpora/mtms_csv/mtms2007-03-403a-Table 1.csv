Solving Quadratic Equations  by Completing Squares,2,mtms2007-03-403a,,
"S hOuLd  we  teach  quadratic  equa-  tions in the middle school? Many teachers might regard this as a difficult task. however, i have found that using a hands-on visual model can make quadratic equations accessible to middle school students. the question is not when we can teach a topic but how to teach a topic to students with a particular level of mathematics knowledge.",3,mtms2007-03-403a,,
"even in high school, some students simply memorize procedures and formulas that lead to the solutions of quadratic equations but have little understanding of their meaning. Students will have a deeper understanding and a better chance of deriving the quadratic formula if they are comfortable with the process of completing the square. however, when this process is given only as a sequence of algebraic steps, it sometimes  makes  little  sense  to  students.  For  example, while teaching in high school, i showed examples of ",4,mtms2007-03-403a,,

"how to solve a quadratic equation by completing the square. Something like this would be on the board: 	x2 + 6x = 27 	x2 + 6x + 9 = 27 + 9 (x + 3)2 = 36 	x + 3 = 6 or x + 3 = –6 	x = 3 or x = –9 i would inevitably be asked how i knew to add 9, not another number, to both sides of the equation in  the  second  line.  an  explanation  like  “because  i squared  half  of  6”  sounds  mysterious  to  most  students. why half of 6? is this some kind of trick? it was important to me that my students not view mathematics as a set of strange rules and tricks but as a harmonious system where everything has a reason. So i connected the algebraic ideas of completing the square with the “tangible” process of working with rectangles  and  squares  using  algebra  tiles.  this method was also used successfully with students in the seventh and eighth grades.  i will describe a way to present ideas related to solving quadratic equations using algebra tiles. this process can be presented during one class or can be discussed over a few consecutive classes.",9,mtms2007-03-403a,,

Figures 4–6 help students  understand  why  we  had  to  add one-half of the second coefficient to x and k/2 square the sum. we completed the square in two ways: geometrically, by adding the k/2 missing unit to the square with side (x + 1), and algebraically, by adding 1 to the x2 + 2x, making it x2 + 2x + 1 = (x + 1) 2.
