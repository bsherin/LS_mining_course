0,Theyll Need It for Calculus - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Imagine a self-propelled lawn mower that is tied to a stake by a rope. As the lawn mower runs, the rope wraps around the stake, pulling the mower closer with each revolution. My Calculus 2 students viewed a video (Atterberry 2010) of this scenario one recent semester. The lawn mower is already under way as the video begins, and the viewer sees only a few revolutions before the video ends.",,
1,Theyll Need It for Calculus - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,We worked to answer this question: How long will it take to complete the mowing?,,
2,Theyll Need It for Calculus - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"As my students undertook the challenge of answering this question, I came to understand that they were struggling to write an equation to describe the lawn mowerâ€™s path. This surprised me, and it forced me to reflect on what it means to be ready for calculus.",,
3,Theyll Need It for Calculus - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Although it is reasonable to question whether secondary mathematics ought to be a pipeline to calculus, this is certainly part of its present function in U.S. schools. This pipeline has many components. They include middle school mathematics, high school algebra, geometry courses, college placement exams, college courses prior to calculus, and so on, right up toâ€”and in the case of my Calculus 2 students working on the Lawn Mower problemâ€”the previous dayâ€™s lesson.",,
4,Theyll Need It for Calculus - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"This article focuses on the big question of what it means to be ready for calculus; it also explores the role of the middle school curriculum in preparing students to study calculus later. This should not be construed as an endorsement of the pipeline to calculus or as an assignment of responsibility for these ideas to the middle school curriculum and to teachers exclusively. Instead, this article is written for an audience of middle school teachers from the perspective of a former middle school teacher and current college teacher. In fact, it is my hope that middle school teachers (many of whom may not have taken calculus themselves) will be able to use these ideas to advocate for a strengthened middle school and high school curriculum and to resist pressures that sometimes exist to emphasize arcane algebraic skills under the premise that, well, â€œTheyâ€™ll need it for calculus.â€",,
5,Theyll Need It for Calculus - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"My students working on the Lawn Mower problem that semester were ready for calculus in the sense that they had mastered a standard list of discrete, challenging skills. As such, they were a typical collection of American calculus students. But my students were not ready for calculus in a very important sense, which is that they could not attack the Lawn Mower problem with something like the following reasoning:",,
6,Theyll Need It for Calculus - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Letâ€™s see, I notice that as the lawn mower goes around the lawn, it gets closer to the center of the circle. I  wonder what the relationship is  between the number of times it has gone around and the distance it is from the center?",,
7,Theyll Need It for Calculus - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I guess I should figure out how much the distance changes for each revolution. Is it always the same,  or is it changing?",,
8,Theyll Need It for Calculus - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I guess itâ€™s about the same every time. I mean, the rope overlaps itself eventually, but basically, itâ€™s just winding around the post. So Iâ€™ll  call it constant.",,
9,Theyll Need It for Calculus - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,And about how long is the rope  at the beginning?,,
10,Theyll Need It for Calculus - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Well, if L is the length of the rope at the beginning, D is the distance from the post to the lawn mower,  T is the number of times the lawn mower has gone around, and C is  the change in the distance on each revolution, then I get . . .",,
11,Theyll Need It for Calculus - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,D = L â€“ CT.,,
12,Theyll Need It for Calculus - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"This line of reasoning does not apply only to the Lawn Mower problem; it is a powerful style of thinking in which we look for important known relationships in novel situations. This kind of thinking is what drives mathematical problem solving in both pure and applied contexts. Ultimately, this is  at the very heart of mathematical thinking, for once we have written  D = L â€“ CT, we may be able to notice that this is just a form of Y = MX + B and that this is a linear equation in polar coordinates. When we recognize the same idea in wildly different costumes (straight lines and spirals, in this case), we are creating important mathematical connections. If we are to foster this kind of thinking in preparation for calculus (or for any other reason), we need to ask students to do it. At all levels of their mathematics education, we need to ask students to notice relationships and to ask questions about these relationshipsâ€”questions that will help them quantify, abstract, study, and operate on the relationships they identify.",,
13,Theyll Need It for Calculus - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,I suggest two such important ideas for students to practice with and describe how they can be developed in the middle school mathematics curriculum. It is important to remember that I argue for the importance of these ideas at all levelsâ€”not least among my college mathematics colleagues.,,
14,Theyll Need It for Calculus - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,The Standard Perspective On What Theyâ€™ll Need,,
15,Theyll Need It for Calculus - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Traditionally, the U.S. curriculum has emphasized algebraic skills as the prerequisites for calculus. Consider the ubiquitous ACCUPLACERÂ® exam used for math course placement at many public and private higher education institutions. Because placement exams represent a major interface between secondary mathematics and college mathematics, they drive much of the conversation about what students need for calculus. This conversation impacts secondary (and probably even elementary) curriculum decisions. Therefore, it is useful for middle school teachers to be aware of some particulars of a commonly used placement exam. The â€œElementary Algebraâ€ portion of the exam â€œmeasures [studentsâ€™] ability to perform basic algebraic operations and to solve problems involving elementary algebraic conceptsâ€ (The College Board 2014). The following topics are examples of standard fare in developmental math courses at the college level; many are listed in the Elementary Algebra topics on the ACCUPLACER exam:",,
16,Theyll Need It for Calculus - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"To the extent that students can perform such skills and state such definitions on command (as on a final exam or placement test), they are deemed ready for calculus. To the extent that they cannot, students are placed in developmental courses.",,
17,Theyll Need It for Calculus - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"If we overemphasize such skills and definitions as gates on the road to calculus, we commit at least two important errors:",,
18,Theyll Need It for Calculus - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The latter concern is what played out as my students tried to complete the Lawn Mower task. My students were fully competent with algebraic skills and with rules for differentiation and integration of algebraic and trigonometric functions. But they lacked key insights about the nature of these functions, and this deficit impeded their ability to solve problems.",,
19,Theyll Need It for Calculus - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,An Alternative Perspective On What Theyâ€™ll Need,,
20,Theyll Need It for Calculus - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I (and others) have a different vision of what it means to be ready for calculus. This alternative perspective de- emphasizes the myriad algebraic skills and definitions, such as those in the preceding list, to make room for important ideas and relationships. I offer the following two ideas as examples.",,
21,Theyll Need It for Calculus - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"A function is a relationship between two variables. Although the formal definition of function is mathematically correct and may have an important role in the secondary and postsecondary mathematics curriculum, it is not a useful reference point for the objects of study in calculus. Instead, the idea of a function as a relationship between variables is a useful reference point. That is, students need to be able to think about functions as describing how one variable changes in response to another.",,
22,Theyll Need It for Calculus - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In the formal definition of function, we think about sets of ordered pairs. This corresponds to thinking about one point at a time on a graph. In calculus, students need to be able to think about how these points on the graph relate to one another. Functions are increasing, decreasing, or constant, and calculus gives us the tools to describe these terms precisely.",,
23,Theyll Need It for Calculus - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In fact, calculus gives us the tools to measure how a function is increasing or decreasing by generalizing the idea of slope.",,
24,Theyll Need It for Calculus - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Slope is a rate of change. Although rise over run gives a way to compute slope, it does not describe what slope means. Instead, slope is the rate of change of the independent variable with respect to the dependent variable. Slope tells us whether a function is increasing, decreasing, or constant, and it quantifies the increase or decrease.",,
25,Theyll Need It for Calculus - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Rise over run computes slope (or rate of change) cleanly when the rate of change is constant, as with linear relationships. But rates of change are not always constant. Calculus deals with the generalization of slope. Calculus gives us ways of talking about rates of change that are changing. In a sense, calculus answers a question like â€œWhat is the slope of a parabola?â€",,
26,Theyll Need It for Calculus - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"But even without the tools of calculus, students can still describe and estimate changing rates of change. Calculus will give them the tools to measure these rates precisely.",,
27,Theyll Need It for Calculus - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,What This Means For The Curriculum,,
28,Theyll Need It for Calculus - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"A common tacit assumption is that students need to develop algebraic skill before they can be asked to describe functions, change, and slopes. Next, I offer three middle school tasks that not only challenge this assumption but also give students opportunities to think through relationships and their rates of change before they master elaborate algebraic skills. Greatly increased exposure to these kinds of tasks has the potential to better prepare students for using the ideasâ€”together with their algebraic skillsâ€”in calculus.",,
29,Theyll Need It for Calculus - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Bike Rentals,,
30,Theyll Need It for Calculus - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In the Grade 7 Connected Mathe-matics 2 unit, Variables and Patterns  (Lappan et al. 2006), students are presented with an extended series of problems that focus on a bike trip business. One problem in the sequence involves comparing quotes for bulk bicycle rentals from two shops: Rockyâ€™s Cycle Center and Adrianâ€™s Bike Shop. Rockyâ€™s Cycle Center offers the quote as a table (see table 1). Table 1 Students review Rockyâ€™s Cycle Center data as a table.",,
31,Theyll Need It for Calculus - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Adrianâ€™s Bike Shop offers the quote as a graph  (see fig. 1).,,
32,Theyll Need It for Calculus - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Students are asked, â€œWhich bike shop should [the tour operators] choose?â€ Better answers to this question involve the idea that it depends on how many bikes the operators intend to rent. If they plan to rent a small number of bikes, they should choose Rockyâ€™s Cycle Center; if they need to rent a large number of bikes, they should choose Adrianâ€™s Bike Shop. Deciding what the cutoff number of bikes will be for each bike shop is challenging and open to a variety of interpretations.",,
33,Theyll Need It for Calculus - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,A common student solution strategy is to add points for Adrianâ€™s Bike Shop to Rockyâ€™s graph (see fig. 2).Fig. 2 It is common for students to add points for Adrianâ€™s data to Rockyâ€™s graph.,,
34,Theyll Need It for Calculus - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Doing this highlights both of our important ideas. The graph demonstrates that there is a relationship between the number of bikes rented and the total cost of renting them; in particular, in both cases, the total cost increases in response to the number of bikes rented.",,
35,Theyll Need It for Calculus - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The graph also helps students notice and talk about the rate of change  at Adrianâ€™s Bike Shop. A typical student claim, â€œAs you get more bikes at Rockyâ€™s bike shop, the cost per extra bike is decreasing,â€ is informal language for discussing a decreasing rate of change.",,
36,Theyll Need It for Calculus - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Finite Differences,,
37,Theyll Need It for Calculus - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Toward the end of a Grade 8 Connected Mathematics 2 unit titled Frogs, Fleas, and Painted Cubes (Lappan et al. 2006), students explicitly investigate patterns of change in nonlinear relationships. At this stage in the curriculum, students have studied linear relationships extensively, as well as exponential growth and decay. They have developed some basic skills in working with quadratic functions, such as using quadratics to represent areas and moving between the factored and expanded forms of simple quadratics.",,
38,Theyll Need It for Calculus - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In one problem, students explore first and second differences for quadratic and exponential relationships. Students use tables to consider how the variable y is changing as the variable x increases by one unit per line (see  fig. 3). Students observe that first differences are constant for linear functions and display a linear pattern of growth for quadratic functions. They also see an exponential pattern for exponential functions.",,
39,Theyll Need It for Calculus - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"This problem can be extended in a number of interesting ways. One that is challenging but achievable for stronger students is to write an equation for the relationship between the independent variable and the first differences. Doing so requires making a subtle notational shift. Instead of writing each first difference between the corresponding  y-values, we can align it with the smaller of the two y-values (see fig. 4). (We could just as easily align with the larger y-value, but aligning with the smaller value matches the standard notation for the difference quotient in calculus.) After doing this (and using y1 to differentiate the first difference equation from the original), the first differences for y = x 2 are described by y1 = 2x + 1and those for y= 2 xare described by y1 = 2x. With eighth graders, there is no need to push the connections to calculus any further, but the first differences in the original activity and the y1 functions in the extended activity give students a way to approximate the relationship between the independent variable and the rate of change. They help students describe how the â€œslopeâ€ of a nonlinear graph is changing.",,
40,Theyll Need It for Calculus - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Sweet Tooth,,
41,Theyll Need It for Calculus - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In the lesson called Sweet Tooth (Mathalicious 2013), students consider the marginal enjoyment that a variety of children get from their Halloween candy. Marginal enjoyment refers to â€œhow much more enjoyment they get from each additional piece of candy.â€ If a child is excited for his first piece of candy but is growing weary by the fifth piece, his marginal enjoyment is decreasing.",,
42,Theyll Need It for Calculus - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"This task reverses the situation from the two preceding tasks. In the earlier tasks, students were given a relationship between two variables and asked to think about, estimate, and use the rate of change. In this task, students are given the rate of change (in the form of marginal enjoyment, which is itself changing) and asked to think about the accumulation of these changing rates (see fig. 5).",,
43,Theyll Need It for Calculus - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
44,Theyll Need It for Calculus - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Indeed, once students have  constructed the total enjoyment relationship, which they typically do with a table in which the third column is a sum instead of a difference, they notice that the first differences of this relationship match the original figures for marginal enjoyment.",,
45,Theyll Need It for Calculus - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Knowledge For The Future,,
46,Theyll Need It for Calculus - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"A calculus student who has experienced as a secondary student a curriculum that included a large number of tasks such as those suggested hereâ€”and whose calculus courses had emphasized these ideas as wellâ€”would be much more likely than my Calculus 2 students were to attack the Lawn Mower problem by identifying the important variables, looking for a relationship between these variables, and investigating the relevant rates  of change.",,
47,Theyll Need It for Calculus - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"This hypothetical student could draw on both algebra and calculus skills to write an equation using polar coordinates, to find the arc length of the lawn mowerâ€™s path, and to use this length together with reasonable estimates for the speed of the lawn mower to approximate the length of time required to mow the lawn.",,
48,Theyll Need It for Calculus - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In short, such a student would be much more ready to use the mathematics learned in school to solve the kind of messy problems that arise outside of school even if he or she had never taken calculus at all.",,
