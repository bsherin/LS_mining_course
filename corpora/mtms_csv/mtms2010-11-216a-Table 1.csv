"Through professional development activities involving action research, our middle-grades teachers learned how to honor students’ prior knowledge and experience by finding out about their K−5 computational development. Rather than complaining about what our students did not know, we learned to appreciate results from their K−5 instruction. These results seem to indicate more conceptual understanding, a strong number sense, and increased computational flexibility than we had seen in the past. The data shared here are specific to our own sixth-grade students and should not be generalized to your students. However, the process we undertook to learn about our students could certainly be used by others who wish to become more cognizant of their middle-grades students’ understandings.",17,mtms2010-11-216a,,
"The last ten years of professional development in our district has changed the way that our pre-middleschool teachers approach computation. The grades K−5 teachers use the Investigations in Number, Data, and Space curriculum (Russell and Economopoulos 2008). It encourages students to develop flexibility, a strong number sense and understanding of place value, and a wide range of conceptual strategies that encompass all four basic operations.

"Our middle grades are using the Connected Mathematics Project (CMP) (Lappan et al. 2006) for mathematics instruction. During one professional development opportunity, we heard teachers complain that they have noticed a change in their current students’ abilities. For example, one teacher mentioned that students in the sixth grade did not seem to know what the term long  division meant. When she would probe her students’ thinking, she realized that students could perform division but that they used other strategies to accomplish the task. Teachers noticed unfamiliar computational strategies for other operations as well, and it often took students longer to perform a computation.",21,mtms2010-11-216a,,
"The “aha!” moment came when  our mathematics instructional leader shared some data on computation collected at the end of the year from each student in grades 3−8 in the school district. A noticeable drop in accuracy and ability to use a multiplication or division computational strategy effectively was found from fifth grade to the sixth grade. Our teachers had not noticed this drop because middle-grades students are allowed to use calculators on most standardized assessments, and these students had shown improvement in the areas that had been the focus of our CMP curriculum: problem solving and open-ended problems.  deFining  coMPUtational FlUencY",22,mtms2010-11-216a,,
We decided to address these changes and concerns by focusing one of our professional development opportunities on the computational understandings of our students. We began by reading Relearning to Teach Arithmetic: Multiplication and Division (Russell 1999). The author first reminded us that computational fluency is composed of three very important skills:  1.  Flexibility 2.  Accuracy 3.  Efficiency,23,mtms2010-11-216a,,
"We discussed her challenge:   By fifth or sixth grade, a student should be able to look at any whole number computation problem and explain what it would take to solve that problem, no matter how large the numbers are. It is up to you and your colleagues to take a hard look at what you want fluency to mean for your students. (p. 67)",24,mtms2010-11-216a,,
"We brainstormed by asking a question such as this:   In a perfect world, what do we want our students to know about multiplication (or division)? Take 35 × 7. What understandings do we want them to have associated with that computation?",25,mtms2010-11-216a,,
"In sharing our ideas, the old expectations of focus on accuracy and speed resurfaced, but fl exibility was often completely missing—the fl exibility to make decisions from a range of strategies to one that is best suited to each particular computational situation. We also wanted our students to have a deeper conceptual understanding of what each operation means, appropriate times to perform it, and a more natural instinct concerning the reasonableness of their answer.",26,mtms2010-11-216a,,
"To learn more about what knowledge and abilities our students brought to the middle grades, we revisited their K−5 computational preparation by giving mini-assessments to each sixth through eighth grader. The rest of this article will focus solely on explorations of our students’ understandings of multiplication, since our learning was extensive.  assessing cURRent stUdents",27,mtms2010-11-216a,,
Our fi rst surprise was the amount of time it took our students to perform one simple computation. Some teachers reported that the following problem took the entire forty-two-minute class period for students to complete and share. ,28,mtms2010-11-216a,,

"Source: Frogs, Fleas, and Painted Cubes of CMP, p. 25 (b) multiplication of algebraic expressions used two approaches, whereas none of the 12 students who were incorrect used two methods. Rather than try to determine which of two methods was preferred, we counted all 84 correct approaches and the 12 incorrect approaches to construct the graph in figure 1. The attempt to solve the problem in more than one way was another feature that teachers had  been noticing in some of their students’ work.",38,mtms2010-11-216a,,
"We also confirmed our prior observations that the traditional algorithm for multiplication was not the most popular solution option. In fact, students used a variety of approaches, which are graphed in figure 1. Among the same 90 students, only 10 (11.1 percent) used the traditional algorithm to solve 13 × 7. The largest group of students (35.6 percent) used a cluster strategy (see Teacher Note in Investigations, Gr. 4, Unit 3, p. 171). This approach relies heavily on the distributive property in which numbers are broken apart and multiplied separately (see fig. 2). ",39,mtms2010-11-216a,,
"The student work in figure 2c is interesting in several ways. The student used the distributive property of multiplication over subtraction [13(10 – 3) = 130 – 39 = 91]. However, notice her method for subtraction. She takes 100 – 39 to get 61, then adds back 30 to get the result. For her, using the compatible numbers of 39 and 61 was an easier way to subtract without needing to regroup. (Her only error is in incorrectly recording 39 – 130 as the method she used.) Her method is not surprising if you look at the amount of emphasis given in the Investigations curriculum on mental strategies, such as using compatible numbers.",40,mtms2010-11-216a,,
"For many of our middle-grades teachers, classifying the approaches used by their students was a challenging but useful exercise. We found difficulty in classification not only because several of the approaches ",41,mtms2010-11-216a,,

"(a) Partial product (b) Clusters (c) Traditional (d) Array were similar but also because some of the methods were unfamiliar. For example, some of our teachers had not seen the array method of multiplication in fi gure 3. The CMP curriculum builds on this approach as students begin to multiply with decimals and with algebraic expressions (see fi g. 4), but many teachers had not seen this process used with whole numbers.  n = 95",44,mtms2010-11-216a,,
Approaches = 151,45,mtms2010-11-216a,,
"We were also not consistent at fi rst  in sorting problems in the same way. This occurred because clustering, the array approach, the partial-product approach, and the traditional algorithm all rely on the distributive property. Often, the numbers are subdivided into tens and ones, causing the same partial products to appear. We mutually agreed that if a rectangle was drawn and subdivided, then it was classifi ed as an array; if students simply listed separate multiplications left to right and summed the answers, then it was a cluster; and if they wrote their work vertically, as in the traditional algorithm, but did not carry, then it was a partial product. (See fi g. 5 for our system.)",46,mtms2010-11-216a,,
"It was also unexpected how many students still relied on repeated addition. It tied with the array method as the second most popular approach, with nearly 1 in 4 students using it. However, when analyzing the repeated addition, it was rare to see anyone adding thirteen 7s (4 students), whereas 17 students added seven 13s. Of those students, we would often see that they had taken shortcuts in the repeated addition by grouping two 13s as 26 and two 26s as 52 to shorten the addition.",47,mtms2010-11-216a,,
"We analyzed the second multiplication problem with the same group of students (but on this day, n = 95). Several things changed when students were given this two-digit × two-digit multiplication problem rather than a two-digit × one-digit problem. ",48,mtms2010-11-216a,,
Problem 2: Consider the problem 26 × 45. First estimate what you think the product would be. Then solve for the exact answer using two different methods.,49,mtms2010-11-216a,,
"First, as would be expected, fewer of the students got this one correct; 54.7 percent were correct compared with 86.7 percent correct on the last problem. However, when we analyzed their work, we noted that 16 of the 43 incorrect answers were given because students performed a single step incorrectly, although the approach and all other computations were correct. In other words, these students have found a useful and correct method but need to strengthen their knowledge of basic multiplication facts, learn to add when numbers have their place values aligned, and so on. For example, four of the students with incorrect answers  gave 450 and 970, which would occur gave 450 and 970, which would occur when you take 20 × 40 = 80 and 20 × 40 = 600, respectively.",50,mtms2010-11-216a,,
"Another noticeable trend when we Another noticeable trend when we  analyzed the two-digit × two-digit problem was that only three students problem was that only three students tried to use repeated addition this time, although nearly 1 in 4 students used this approach the previous time (see fi g. 6). This indicated to us that students have other methods available to them and that they will adjust their approach according to the problem at hand. One student who used repeated addition correctly knew that adding twenty-six 45s would be the same as adding thirteen 90s and, therefore, 13 × 9 with a zero tacked on would be a quicker calculation. ",51,mtms2010-11-216a,,
"This fl exibility between approaches was also observed when analyzing the work of the 41 students who used two methods correctly. Thirteen students performed the calculations very differently the second time so that if a calculation error was made with the fi rst approach, they would catch it by using the second approach. For example, one student used cluster problems both times, fi rst by adding (20 × 45) + (6 × 45) and second by adding (26 × 40) + (26 × 5). This example suggests that some students have been fl exible in integrating the distributive property into their approaches. ",52,mtms2010-11-216a,,
"As seen in the fi rst problem, few students (20 percent) used the standard algorithm to solve 26 × 45, and this time, they did so with less accuracy (see fi g. 6). The second problem actually asked the students to solve using two methods (see table 1). Our observation that 56 of the 95 showed two approaches made the fi rst statistic even more striking since only 19 students thought to use the standard algorithm as one of two possible approaches. Of the correct answers, 81 percent of students had two approaches available to them, ",53,mtms2010-11-216a,,
We must ﬁ nd more We must ﬁ nd more opportunities for students to use mental math and paper-and-pencil math rather than having calculators  available 100  percent of the time.,54,mtms2010-11-216a,,
"whereas 33 percent of students with incorrect answers used two methods. There could be many other factors that explain this correlation, but we wondered if fl exibility in method can actually help improve accuracy in computation. ",55,mtms2010-11-216a,,
WheRe do We go FRoM heRe?,56,mtms2010-11-216a,,
"It is clear from our assessments that our students left fi fth grade with a lot of computational fl exibility. However, most of them have not yet progressed to computational fl uency. During several student interviews, they said that  table 1 Students were asked to use two approaches to evaluate 26 × 45. ",57,mtms2010-11-216a,,

",61,mtms2010-11-216a,,
"Our group views this as a positive  change. One of our problems with trying to get our past students to learn had been a result of students having been programmed by past instruction to want their teachers to simply get to the bottom line: “Tell me how to do this; I don’t want to understand it, I just want to get my homework done!” This new autonomous view aligns well with the CMP philosophy for learning about students’ critical thinking. Sharing arguments and ideas without as much teacher guidance will enable them to solve problems.",62,mtms2010-11-216a,,
"Our implementation and analysis of short mini-assessments helped us see that our students arrive with much more conceptual understanding than we had previously observed. We had spent our time complaining about what our students could not do, and we failed to see that a different set of computational strategies and learning outcomes had been the focus of their K−5 curriculum. ",63,mtms2010-11-216a,,
"We now see that our main goal with computation is to try to strengthen the foundations that have already been built, foundations that rely solely on conceptual understanding, many visual examples, and reasons why the math makes sense. ",64,mtms2010-11-216a,,
"If we want our students to become  computationally fl uent, we need to address their particular needs while implementing our CMP curriculum as closely as possible. For us, this includes fi nding instructional moments when students with different but very similar computations can model their approaches side by side. Much can be learned from comparing one student modeling the standard algorithm with another student who is using a partialproducts strategy. ",65,mtms2010-11-216a,,
"We also see that our instruction can build on the strategies our students already understand. The array model for multiplication is a powerful approach, and we can build on their whole-number understandings by using arrays as we explore the realm of multiplication with decimals, fractions, and algebraic expressions. ",66,mtms2010-11-216a,,
We need to find more opportunities for our students to use mental math and paper-and-pencil mathematics rather than having calculators available 100 percent of the time. This would help strengthen their recall of basic facts and keep them mentally involved in the computations whenever it is appropriate.,67,mtms2010-11-216a,,
"Do we need to “shift” to the traditional algorithm when many of our students are competently using and understanding a different approach? If we have a subset of students that  can be flexible, efficient, and accurate by using a partial-products approach for multiplication, have these students attained fluency? Overall, this process of learning about the computational knowledge that our students bring to middle school has highlighted the importance of flexibility. We will continue to work toward efficiency and accuracy. However, these aspects of computational fluency are being emphasized less as we learn to work with students who come to us with more conceptual understanding. We are enjoying the fact that more of our students wish to know the “why” underlying each concept. We hope to continue nurturing their curiosity as we approach new subjects.",68,mtms2010-11-216a,,
