3,Weaving Mathematical Concepts through Native American Baskets,"Arizona, New Mexico, southern Colorado, and Utah is indicative of the American Southwest and is reﬂ ected in Southwestern baskets. Many Southwestern basket weavers use coiling as their method of construction (see ﬁ g. 1). The following problems relate mathematics to the art of basket weaving, with an emphasis on coiling.  1.  The diameter of a basket graphed against the number of coils yields a linear function. Assume that the weaver would like to use a coil that is 1/4 inch in diameter. Find and graph this relationship. The equation gives basket weavers a sense of the diameter’s length before they make the basket (Explore Utah Science 2014).  2.  Basket designs often consist of  mathematical transformations. Using the basket shown in ﬁ gure 2, ﬁ nd the lines of reﬂ ective symmetry. Note: Because of the nature of coiling, the lines may be approximate.",3,Weaving Mathematical Concepts through Native American Baskets

A set of simulations titled “Cultur- ally Situated Design Tools” was created to design patterns that are inherent to Latino and Native American cultures. The simulations are available as free applets online at http://csdt.rpi.edu/. Mathematical concepts include transformational geometry, Cartesian coordinates, angles, parabolas, and counting.
