3,Responding to Students Work on a Rich Task,"Education experts argue that using rich mathematical tasks in studentcentered classrooms is especially conducive to student learning (NCTM 2000). That said, they also acknowledge that using complex tasks and developing student-centered classrooms can be intimidating and challenging for teachers (Chazan and Ball 1999). One difficulty associated with using complex tasks is ensuring that high levels of cognitive demand are maintained throughout the lesson while engaging every learner. Researchers Darling-Hammond and Snyder (2000) enlarged on this difficulty when writing that the that is different for each one. (p. 523)",3,Responding to Students Work on a Rich Task

5,Responding to Students Work on a Rich Task,"Professional growth of teachers is greatly affected by their reflection on learning and teaching, individually or collaboratively (NCTM 2000; Schön 1983). Such reflection includes “examining, framing, and attempting to solve the dilemmas of classroom practice; and being aware of and questioning the assumptions and values he or she brings to teaching” (Chapman 2009,  p. 121). Other reflection areas can include the interactive process of working with students, analyzing their work, and using these data to form a helpful response (NCTM 2000).

9,Responding to Students Work on a Rich Task,Teaching via problem solving has been shown to be an effective way of engaging students in learning with understanding. This participatory pedagogy allows the teacher to enable rich mathematical discussions that originate from working on challenging problems whose solutions provide a launching pad for deeper explorations. Learning and teaching via problem solving differ from the traditional teacher-led approaches in the areas of the teacher’s and the students’ roles (see table 1). ,9,Responding to Students Work on a Rich Task

We spend the first several classes of the semester modeling problem solving by engaging students in solving nonroutine tasks. This kind of student-centered teaching approach has prompted us to think critically about how to aid our students’ involvement in the learning process.

We sought to use cognitively complex mathematical tasks to engage students while they worked in cooperative problem-solving groups. To conclude the fractions unit, we presented this Marriage problem:   In an adult condominium, 2/3 of the men are married to 3/5 of the women. Assuming the residents of the condominium are monogamous, find the fraction of residents that are married. (Masingila and Lester 1998, p. 226) ",44,Responding to Students Work on a Rich Task

73,Responding to Students Work on a Rich Task,"After giving students time to read the problem, we drew them into a whole-class discussion to establish a shared understanding of the problem (e.g., ascertaining that there is no polygamy and that all marriages are heterosexual). We then asked students to work in groups to find a solution. While they worked, we circulated around the room, monitoring their progress and problem solving. Our actions depended on students’ needs, strengths, and approaches. Table 2 shows examples of student work and our typical responses.",73,Responding to Students Work on a Rich Task
74,Responding to Students Work on a Rich Task,"By responding deliberately to  student work, we could scaffold their reasoning and help them move forward in the problem-solving process without giving them the solution. For example, we questioned one group using a common denominator approach (see  table 2), causing them to re-examine what their fractions represented. One student noted that one married man was missing a wife, which demonstrated a clearer understanding of the problem. We followed this comment by asking, “What does this tell us about the comparison of the number of men to the number of women?” The group realized that the total number of men and the total number of women (denominators) must be different because the two fractions were not equal; however, it was the number of married men and the number of married women (numerators) that needed to be equal. They decided to use the least common multiple of 9 and 10 and determined that they needed  then used tiles and proportional  reasoning to model the problem (see fig. 2).",74,Responding to Students Work on a Rich Task
75,Responding to Students Work on a Rich Task,"We were pleased with this group’s  reasoning and resourcefulness. Another group used similar thinking and found two new fractions with a common numerator that were equivalent to 2/3 and 3/5 (see the “common numerator” row in table 2 on p. 167). Although students in this group mentioned that finding a common numerator “felt weird” and unnatural, it seemed to make sense for this problem. However, some in the group still questioned the generalizability of this approach. ",75,Responding to Students Work on a Rich Task
76,Responding to Students Work on a Rich Task,"Most groups responded positively  to scaffolding, but one group struggled from the beginning. No member of the group understood what the problem was asking. In listening to their dialogue (see fig. 3), we identified this group’s struggle as being one of the areas we anticipated: not understanding the problem.

77,Responding to Students Work on a Rich Task,"This group struggled to make sense  of the problem and was taking a path that would not lead to a solution— simplifying 2/3 of 3/5. Although we were pleased that the students used their prior knowledge appropriately to determine that 2/3 of 3/5 is 2/5, this was not going to answer the question. The instructor’s suggestion was meant to give the group a concrete diagram that could be used to model the problem. However, this suggestion did not initally produce the hoped-for results. Student 1, who was the natural group leader, continued to lead the others in using this new instrument with the same unproductive path of simplifying 2/3 of 3/5.

Although groups that used comparable reasoning nodded in  agreement, other groups were surprised by this approach’s simplicity. The second group explained that a common denominator was initially found, 10/15 and 9/15; however, those students then decided to use tiles and proportional reasoning to match the numerators, obtaining 90/135 and 90/150.
