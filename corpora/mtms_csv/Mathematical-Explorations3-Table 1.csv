2,Mathematical Explorations: Rethink Your Drink,"Although most students are probably aware that soft drinks are not good for their health, they may not be aware that other drinks, such as fruit juice and fl avored milk, often have just as much sugar. The activities in this article give teachers a way to introduce some important nutritional information to students while engaging them in exploring ratio, proportion, data analysis, and measurement—important mathematical concepts in the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSI 2010). By investigat- students’ initial ideas",2,Mathematical Explorations: Rethink Your Drink
3,Mathematical Explorations: Rethink Your Drink,"In the days preceding the activity, students can be asked to bring in empty containers of their favorite beverages. Students are then shown a variety of popular drinks, including sodas, ice teas, sports drinks, energy drinks, juices, and fl avored milk, and asked which they think is the healthiest beverage. There is no one right answer to this question; students may focus on calories, sugar content, artifi cial ingredients, caffeine, vitamins, and so on. Projecting images of popular drinks on a screen is also an effective way to frame the conversation because many labels are designed to make a drink look and sound healthy. At this point, the goal is to collect and record students’ ideas about what makes a drink healthy and introduce information found on nutritional labels.

This is also good time to introduce some facts about sugar consumption (e.g., Harvard School of Public Health 2013) and ask students to predict which drinks have the most sugar.

13,Mathematical Explorations: Rethink Your Drink,Part 2: how Much  sugar is that?,13,Mathematical Explorations: Rethink Your Drink
14,Mathematical Explorations: Rethink Your Drink,"Students determine how many grams of sugar are in each container and then represent the amounts with sugar cubes. The teacher can work through one example with the class and then distribute the remaining containers among small groups of two to four students. Finding the number of grams of sugar in a beverage container is not as simple as it sounds because most nutritional labels show the grams of sugar in one serving of the drink. Serving sizes may range from 6 ounces to  12 ounces, although most drink containers have between 12 and 20 ounces.",14,Mathematical Explorations: Rethink Your Drink
15,Mathematical Explorations: Rethink Your Drink,"For example, the label for a popular  brand of chocolate milk (see fig. 1), lists 28 grams of sugar per serving, a serving size of 1 cup, and 2 servings per container. However, the chocolate ",15,Mathematical Explorations: Rethink Your Drink

",17,Mathematical Explorations: Rethink Your Drink
18,Mathematical Explorations: Rethink Your Drink,"Several methods can be used to find the amount of sugar in the container: 1.  Divide the grams of sugar in   1 serving by the serving size to find the grams per ounce, then multiply this number by the number of ounces in the bottle.",18,Mathematical Explorations: Rethink Your Drink
19,Mathematical Explorations: Rethink Your Drink,"2.  Divide the number of ounces in   1 serving by the number of ounces in the container, then multiply this number by the grams of sugar listed for one serving.",19,Mathematical Explorations: Rethink Your Drink
20,Mathematical Explorations: Rethink Your Drink,3.  Use a ratio table to work from the  ratio of sugar to ounces in 1 serving to an equivalent ratio of sugar to ounces in the container (see fig. 2). ,20,Mathematical Explorations: Rethink Your Drink
21,Mathematical Explorations: Rethink Your Drink,Each method leads to the conclusion that 49 grams of sugar are in this container of chocolate milk.,21,Mathematical Explorations: Rethink Your Drink
22,Mathematical Explorations: Rethink Your Drink,"It is important to note that there are no standard guidelines for how nutritional information is listed on drink containers. Some containers report the amount of sugar per serving and per container whereas many do not. As the example of the chocolate milk illustrates, the number of servings per container is often an estimate. Likewise, some container  sizes are multiples of the serving size; others are not. Therefore, the way in which the teacher assigns the drink containers among the students or small groups can be used to equalize the difficulty level or provide for differentiation. ",22,Mathematical Explorations: Rethink Your Drink
23,Mathematical Explorations: Rethink Your Drink,"Once students have determined how much sugar is in the container, the next step is to represent that amount concretely with sugar cubes. This part of the lesson was inspired by the SugarStacks website (http:// www.sugarstacks.com). Because each cube is equivalent to 2 grams of sugar, students can use simple division to determine the appropriate number of sugar cubes to use. The chocolate milk’s 49 grams of sugar would require 24 1/2, or 25, sugar cubes. When  25 cubes are counted out and placed in a clear plustic cup, students are amazed (see fig. 3). ",23,Mathematical Explorations: Rethink Your Drink
24,Mathematical Explorations: Rethink Your Drink,"Once the teacher has worked  through one example with the class, the remaining containers are distributed. Students work cooperatively to find the number of grams of sugar and represent the amounts with sugar cubes. When they finish, they write that amount on a label (a folded index card or sticky note works well) and place the container, cup, and label on a table or other long surface. As groups finish, they order their beverages from least to greatest in terms of total sugar content (see fig. 4). Each group should also record its data on a class chart that contains columns for drink ",24,Mathematical Explorations: Rethink Your Drink

26,Mathematical Explorations: Rethink Your Drink,"name, total ounces in the container, and ounces of sugar in the container. When students see the containers on display (see fig. 4), they are amazed at how much sugar is in their favorite drinks. Seeing a cup filled with sugar cubes gives students a concrete understanding of how much sugar they are consuming. They also discover that the container sizes differ, sometimes dramatically. This realization can lead to a discussion of why it might be important to have a standard for comparison, which is the next part of the lesson.",26,Mathematical Explorations: Rethink Your Drink
27,Mathematical Explorations: Rethink Your Drink,"At this point, the teacher can introduce the American Heart Association’s recommendation that adolescents should not consume more than 5 teaspoons, or 20 grams, of sugar per  day. This information gives students a new reference point. One student commented, “This bottle of Sprite has enough sugar for 3 days!” Students will find that few nondiet beverages contain less than 20 grams of sugar in a single bottle or can. (A few options include coconut water, the Honest Tea brand, and vitaminwater®.) This is also a good opportunity to discuss the importance of considering container size when selecting beverages. ",27,Mathematical Explorations: Rethink Your Drink
28,Mathematical Explorations: Rethink Your Drink,Part 3: eXPloring unit rate,28,Mathematical Explorations: Rethink Your Drink
29,Mathematical Explorations: Rethink Your Drink,"As students are viewing the containers on display, the class can discuss how the amount of sugar can be more accurately compared when the sizes are so different. Students may suggest either using a standard serving size, such as  8 ounces, or finding the amount of sugar in 1 ounce, or a unit rate. Depending on the time available and grade-level goals, the teacher can ask students to go back to their groups to calculate the unit rate for the entire list, dividing the work among the groups or entering the data into a computer program. ",29,Mathematical Explorations: Rethink Your Drink
30,Mathematical Explorations: Rethink Your Drink,"Students who have not been  formally introduced to proportions can reason about unit rate when it is presented concretely. For example, one student used a process of halving to calculate a unit rate: If an 8 ounce container of orange juice has 24 grams of sugar, then 4 ounces has 12 grams, 2 ounces has 6 grams, and 1 ounce has 3 grams. Once students have determined  the unit rates, they can reorganize the display of containers (or use a second set) to see how the order changes. ",30,Mathematical Explorations: Rethink Your Drink
31,Mathematical Explorations: Rethink Your Drink,"See the example shown in figure 5. After students calculated the unit rates, the teacher entered the results into an Excel chart, created a graphical display, and projected the data to begin the second day of the activity. The students could compare this graph with the display from the previous day to see how comparison by unit rate changed the ordering. For example, a 32 ounce bottle of Gatorade® had 56 grams of sugar but only 1.8 grams of sugar per ounce; therefore, this drink moved much lower in the list. Students could also see how certain categories were grouped together. For example, fruit juices tended to have around 3 grams of sugar per ounce, and sodas contain between 3.2 and 3.5 grams.  eXtensions",31,Mathematical Explorations: Rethink Your Drink
32,Mathematical Explorations: Rethink Your Drink,"The results that are generated from comparing the amount of sugar in popular beverages are surprising for most students and adults alike. Beverages that we think of as being healthy,  such as cranberry cocktail and flavored milk, turn out to have the most sugar per ounce. Even fruit juices with no added sugar have an amount of sugar on par with most sodas. Drinks that tend to be sold in larger sizes, like ice tea and soda, have staggering amounts of sugar (a 20 ounce bottle of grape soda has a whopping 59 grams of sugar). When the results of this lesson ",32,Mathematical Explorations: Rethink Your Drink
