0,Dollars _ Sense_ Students Integer Perspectives - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Consider the following story problem about money, which we posed to  40 seventh graders during an interview that involved a variety of integer-related tasks:",,
1,Dollars _ Sense_ Students Integer Perspectives - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Yesterday, you borrowed $8 from a friend to buy a school T-shirt. Today, you borrowed another $5 from the same friend to buy lunch. Whatâ€™s the situation now?",,
2,Dollars _ Sense_ Students Integer Perspectives - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,We asked the students who in the story would owe money to whom and how much. We also asked each student to write an equation to describe the situation. How would you expect students to respond?,,
3,Dollars _ Sense_ Students Integer Perspectives - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Many of the seventh graders wrote 8 + 5 = 13 to describe the story. Evelyn explained that the numbers in her equation represented amounts of money borrowed from her friend. Her equation showed that she now owed her friend $13. A few students wrote equations involving negative numbers, such as â€“8 + â€“5 = â€“13. Most students who did not initially write equations involving negatives nonetheless were able to interpret these equations.",,
4,Dollars _ Sense_ Students Integer Perspectives - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We found that students had different ways of relating these equations to the story. For example, Chrissy said that â€“8 + â€“5 = â€“13 described the story because negative numbers represented money that you owe. Anh said that this same equation, â€“8 + â€“5 = â€“13, also described the scenario because negative numbers represented money that you took from your friend.",,
5,Dollars _ Sense_ Students Integer Perspectives - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"When we began talking with students, we viewed borrowing money as a context for the topic of integers. We expected that students who had studied integers would use negative numbers to represent money owed. We were surprised to find that students often did not use negative numbers to describe this situation and that they had different ways of relating equations to the story. At the same time, studentsâ€™ responses made sense. In this article, we describe the sense that students made of the money problem and how they related it to equations.",,
6,Dollars _ Sense_ Students Integer Perspectives - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,SIGNED NUMBERS,,
7,Dollars _ Sense_ Students Integer Perspectives - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We describe ideas related to integers (both positive and negative) and how students used them in relation to a story problem. Before instruction on integers, which typically occurs in middle school (CCSSI 2010), the notion of sign is rarely if ever discussed. Therefore, for much of their childhood, many students live in a world  in which numbers have no signs.  We count 1, 2, 3â€”not positive 1,  positive 2, positive 3. Then students are told that some numbers are  negative and that familiar numbers like 3 are actually positive. Furthermore, these signed numbers behave in strange ways that contradict previous generalizations that students have made. We confound students further with the information that addition can make smaller and that subtraction can make larger. Studentsâ€™ mathematical worlds have therefore been turned upside down. This explains why students often learn to operate with integers without having a conceptual understanding.",,
8,Dollars _ Sense_ Students Integer Perspectives - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,INVESTIGATING STUDENTSâ€™ UNDERSTANDING,,
9,Dollars _ Sense_ Students Integer Perspectives - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The Common Coreâ€™s Standards for Mathematical Practice emphasize modeling real-world situations mathematically, making sense of problems, and relating symbols to contexts  (CCSSI 2010). Overall, the emphasis is on students doing mathematics with understanding. Contexts such as money, elevation, and temperature are commonly found in the integer sections of middle school textbooks. In fact, in a review of 18 fifth-grade and sixth-grade textbooks, Whitacre et al. (2011) found that the context of money was associated with integers in all but one textbook. Given the prevalence of this context, we were interested in how students thought about relationships between story problems that involved money and arithmetic equations.",,
10,Dollars _ Sense_ Students Integer Perspectives - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"To investigate studentsâ€™ thinking, we interviewed 40 seventh graders. These interviews were conducted in spring 2011 after the students had studied integers in grades five, six, and seven. The interviews consisted of a variety of tasks, many of which explicitly involved negative integers. One task asked students to relate equations to the money problem. We found that students who had studied integers had different ways of relating equations to this story problem.",,
11,Dollars _ Sense_ Students Integer Perspectives - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,STUDENTSâ€™ RESPONSES,,
12,Dollars _ Sense_ Students Integer Perspectives - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Given the story problem about money, all 40 students answered correctly that the borrower would owe the friend $13. The majority (80 percent) wrote the equation 8 + 5 = 13, which seemed to reflect their thinking about the problem. One such student, Evelyn, explained her thinking this way:",,
13,Dollars _ Sense_ Students Integer Perspectives - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Okay. So yesterday I borrowed  $8 from my friend to buy a school T-shirt. So I have $8 from my friend [points to the 8 that she wrote].  And then today I borrowed $5 from the same friend, and I bought a lunch. And then plus 5 that I  borrowed from her [circles the 5 with her pen] equals 13 dollars  that I borrowed from her [circles the 13 with her pen]. And whatâ€™s the situation? I owe her 13 dollars [points to the 13].",,
14,Dollars _ Sense_ Students Integer Perspectives - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Evelynâ€™s explanation demonstrates that she knew very well who owed money to whom. To represent the situation, adding whole numbers sufficed for her. She did not need negative numbers to solve this problem or to represent it with an equation. Students who reasoned like Evelyn were perfectly capable of making sense of the story and representing it with an equation without invoking negatives.",,
15,Dollars _ Sense_ Students Integer Perspectives - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We, along with many teachers, have often used such contexts as borrowing money in integer instruction. Our instruction and the majority of textbook examples focused on how students could use negative numbers to represent the story problem. Therefore, during an interview that focused on these numbers, we were surprised that only 20 percent of students, after substantial instruction, wrote an equation involving negative numbers. The students who did use negative numbers wrote â€“8 + â€“5 = â€“13 or â€“8 â€“ 5 = â€“13. (One student wrote L8 + L5 = L13, in which L stood for his friend Liam. We group this response with those that involve negative numbers because the student used a symbol to indicate directional information.) Students explained equations involving negatives in one of  two ways:",,
16,Dollars _ Sense_ Students Integer Perspectives - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,These interpretations were echoed in the responses of students who wrote  8 + 5 = 13 initially and then were shown equations involving negative numbers. What follows is elaboration on these interpretations.,,
17,Dollars _ Sense_ Students Integer Perspectives - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,STUDENTSâ€™ INTERPRETATIONS OF EQUATIONS,,
18,Dollars _ Sense_ Students Integer Perspectives - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"After students wrote their own  equations to describe the story, regardless of what they had written, interviewers showed them the equations 8 + 5 = 13, â€“8 + â€“5 = â€“13, and â€“8 â€“ 5 = â€“13, explaining that these equations had been written by other students. Interviewers asked whether the student thought that these equations described the story and why or why not. In most cases, students had written 8 + 5 = 13 and were then asked to reason about equations involving negative numbers.",,
19,Dollars _ Sense_ Students Integer Perspectives - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Two of the 40 students thought that negative numbers had nothing to do with the story and that these equations did not make sense. The other 38 students were able to interpret equations involving negatives in relation to the story. (Eight of the students had written equations like these, whereas the other 30 students had written 8 + 5 = 13.) Students thought about the relationship between negative numbers and the story in two distinct ways. We refer to these as the Negatives as Debt perspective and the Negatives as Loss perspective.",,
20,Dollars _ Sense_ Students Integer Perspectives - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Negatives as Debt,,
21,Dollars _ Sense_ Students Integer Perspectives - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Chrissy expressed this perspective, writing 8 + 5 = 13 to describe the story. When shown â€“8 + â€“5 = â€“13, she offered her interpretation:",,
22,Dollars _ Sense_ Students Integer Perspectives - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Letâ€™s see: â€“8 + â€“5 = â€“13. Well, since you owe the person, the negative represents that. So, you have â€“8. Then you add another â€“5 for the next day, which equals â€“13, which is what you owe the friend.",,
23,Dollars _ Sense_ Students Integer Perspectives - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Chrissy had not used negative numbers in her own equation, but she was able to interpret â€“8 + â€“5 = â€“13 in relation to the story. She said that the negative numbers represented money owed to the friend. Therefore, for Chrissy, the given equation described the story. Chrissy interpreted the equation in a way that is common in textbook presentations (Whitacre et al. 2011). She viewed negative numbers as appropriate for representing money owed. In this interpretation, negative numbers make sense to describe the situation from the borrowerâ€™s side because the borrower owes money. One-half of the 38 students who were able to relate equations involving negatives concurred with Chrissy, using the Negatives as Debt perspective. The other half of the students analyzed it differently.",,
24,Dollars _ Sense_ Students Integer Perspectives - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Negatives as Loss,,
25,Dollars _ Sense_ Students Integer Perspectives - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Anh expressed this loss perspective. Like Chrissy, she wrote 8 + 5 = 13 to describe the story. When Anh was shown â€“8 + â€“5 = â€“13, she read the equation out loud and gave this interpretation:",,
26,Dollars _ Sense_ Students Integer Perspectives - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"â€“8 + â€“5 = â€“13. I would think thatâ€™s sort of right because you subtracted $8 from your friend, and then you subtracted 5 again. So, you tookâ€”so, negativeâ€™s like you tookâ€”so, you took $13 from your friend.",,
27,Dollars _ Sense_ Students Integer Perspectives - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Anhâ€™s sensible interpretation of this equation in terms of the story problem was distinct from Chrissyâ€™s. For Anh, negative numbers indicated that â€œyou tookâ€ money from the friend. â€œYou tookâ€ $8 and $5, so a total of $13 was taken from the friend. From this Negatives as Loss perspective, negatives make sense from the lenderâ€™s, rather than the borrowerâ€™s, side because the lender lost money. Although the Negatives as Loss perspective differs from the more conventional Negatives as Debt perspective, it is important to be aware of and recognize this perspective because one-half of the 38 students used the Negatives as Loss perspective.",,
28,Dollars _ Sense_ Students Integer Perspectives - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,SUMMARY OF STUDENTSâ€™ RESPONSES,,
29,Dollars _ Sense_ Students Integer Perspectives - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"All the seventh graders in our study were able to solve the story problem about money. However, only  20 percent wrote an equation involving negative numbers, whereas  80 percent wrote the equation  8 + 5 = 13. When asked to interpret equations involving negative numbers in relation to the story, 95 percent of the 40 students were able to do so. However, they did so in two distinct, but equally common, ways: by thinking of Negatives as Debt and by thinking of Negatives as Loss.",,
30,Dollars _ Sense_ Students Integer Perspectives - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Many middle school mathematics textbooks expect students to use negative numbers to represent stories involving money and other contexts, and textbooks may privilege either one or the other reasoning path (Whitacre et al. 2011). We believe that the students we interviewed had reasonable and mathematically valid ways of representing the situation of borrowing money from a friend. Each described a correspondence between their equation and the story; they just did this in different ways. Tables 1 and 2 summarize studentsâ€™ responses.",,
31,Dollars _ Sense_ Students Integer Perspectives - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,ACCOUNTING FOR DIRECTIONAL INFORMATION,,
32,Dollars _ Sense_ Students Integer Perspectives - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"When students used or interpreted negative numbers, they described the magnitudes and signs of the numbers as having distinct meanings in the story: The magnitudes conveyed how much money was involved, whereas the signs conveyed directional information, such as who had borrowed money from whom. When students wrote and explained 8 + 5 = 13, they seemed to be thinking of the numbers as representing the amount of money involved but not the direction of borrowing or owing. That directional information was something that students, like Evelyn, knew from the story and made a point to explain. However, the students did not seem to think of the equation as doing the job of conveying directional information; they seemed to see the 8, 5, and 13 in the equation as having magnitude but not sign. (Note that Evelyn and all but two of the students were capable of interpreting negative numbers in relation to the story. However, they did not use negatives or show evidence of reasoning about numbers as signed until they were asked to interpret equations like â€“8 + â€“5 = â€“13.)",,
33,Dollars _ Sense_ Students Integer Perspectives - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,NOTATIONAL CONVENTIONS,,
34,Dollars _ Sense_ Students Integer Perspectives - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Looking beyond mathematics class, we find that different notational conventions are used to describe situations involving money in our everyday lives. If you make a $100 purchase using a debit card, your bank statement may show the amount as â€“$100, and your account balance will be reduced by $100. If you make a $100 purchase using a credit card, your credit card statement may show the amount as $100, and your account balance will be increased by $100.",,
35,Dollars _ Sense_ Students Integer Perspectives - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Bank statements represent the amount of money that one has stored in the bank, whereas credit card statements represent the amount of money that is owed to the credit card company. As a result, different notational conventions are used to record transactions that the purchaser may regard as essentially the same. Mathematically literate adults are able to make sense of the different ways that numbers are used to represent real-world situations. Mathematics instruction that supports studentsâ€™ understanding of these different notational conventions will help students become more mathematically literate and see mathematics as relevant to everyday life.",,
36,Dollars _ Sense_ Students Integer Perspectives - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,VALUING DIFFERENT INTERPRETATIONS,,
37,Dollars _ Sense_ Students Integer Perspectives - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"When using contexts to help students make sense of integers, it is useful to be open and to share with students that more than one way makes sense. Otherwise, many students may get the message, either explicitly or implicitly, that the sense they make is incorrect. If we expect the use of contexts to support studentsâ€™ learning about integers, we need to be aware of the different ways that students reason about relationships between numbers and contexts. As teachers, we need to have the ability to recognize studentsâ€™ perspectives, so that we can be aware of differences between our own reasoning and that of our students. If we do not recognize these differences, we may view our students as â€œnot getting itâ€ or â€œbeing confused,â€ rather than recognizing that these students are thinking in consistent and reasonable ways that simply do not match a convention used in the textbook.",,
38,Dollars _ Sense_ Students Integer Perspectives - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"What can we, as teachers, do with the ideas and findings presented in this article? How can this information be useful? We hope that teachers will find different ways of incorporating the information into their teaching. We offer a few suggestions:",,
39,Dollars _ Sense_ Students Integer Perspectives - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"When given a task presented as having multiple solutions and given opportunities to share what they think, students will likely produce a variety of equations. In discussing their equations, students will likely express both the Negatives as Debt and Negatives as Loss perspectives. If we as teachers recognize these different ways of reasoning, we can highlight the distinctions to help students be more precise in relating equations to contexts. Students could suggest names for different ways of reasoning (e.g., â€œNegative means losing, positive means gainingâ€), or the class could refer to them by studentsâ€™ names (e.g., â€œAnhâ€™s wayâ€ or â€œChrissyâ€™s wayâ€). It is important for students to have opportunities to explain how they are making sense of their reasoning, especially when they are grappling with a challenging topic. Therefore, encourage students to express how they are thinking about the task.",,
40,Dollars _ Sense_ Students Integer Perspectives - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The relationships of integers to contexts are not simple matters. Discussing these relationships may raise ideas that are strange or counter- intuitive for students. We want to  be open and honest with students about the challenges associated with connecting symbolic notations to contexts and acknowledge that different ways of reasoning make sense. Using examples from real life (like bank and credit card statements) can show students the relevance of different reasoning. If we wish to see only one correct answer, we may want to include specific parameters regarding what part of the situation the solution is meant to represent. These details would be great topics for discussion.",,
41,Dollars _ Sense_ Students Integer Perspectives - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,UNDERSTANDING  INTEGERS DEEPLY,,
42,Dollars _ Sense_ Students Integer Perspectives - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In mathematics, understanding integers deeply includes being able to think about ways in which integers can be related to contexts. Understanding involves being familiar with and making sense of conventions and recognizing that conventions are merely conventional; in other words, they could be otherwise. Students have distinct, reasonable ways of relating integers to contexts; these may or may not match a particular convention. We suggest that, as teachers, we recognize when we adopt a convention and keep in mind that it is a way, not the way. We plan to engage students in discussions in which they consider different ways of relating integers to contexts. These discussions can serve to clarify and enhance studentsâ€™ understandings of integers and help them see mathematics as sensible, relevant, and interesting.",,
