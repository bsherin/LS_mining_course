"Malik and Melinda each have an unmarked 4-inch wooden ruler. They realized that if they placed only two wellchosen marks on the rod, they could measure any inch unit length from 1 inch to 4 inches. Malik marked the 1-inch length and the 3-inch length. Melinda marked the 1-inch length and the 2-inch length.",6,mtms2008-10-167a,,
