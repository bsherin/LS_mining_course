A specially designed professional development program  supports quality instruction by novice teachers.,2,mtms2011-12-282a,,
"mMany preservice teachers are introduced to NCTM’s Principles and Standards for School Mathematics (2000) and practices that support those Standards as part of their teacher education programs. They often appear to accept the underlying principles, and many intend to implement this type of instruction in their own classrooms. Unfortunately, as novice teachers, they experience diffi culty in putting the needed practices in place because of classroom management, lack of resources, or demands of time to prepare lessons and activities (Hart 2004; Judson and Sawada 2001; LaBerge and Sons 1999; Skott 2001; and Steele 2001).

"Although a variety of compounding variables can thwart the novice teacher, this article will focus on the one that impacts all the others: classroom management. A professional development program will be described that is designed to support the beginning teachers’ implementation of Standards-based instruction that is aligned with Principles and Standards. The strategies that were used to help these beginning teachers manage their classrooms when they ventured into this type of instruction will also be discussed. This classroom management issue will be viewed through  the eyes of Angie, a fi rst-year teacher. Angie is interested in following the NCTM Standards and describes her ideal mathematics classroom:",4,mtms2011-12-282a,,

Beginning teachers can implement specific strategies to handle classroom management issues that invariably arise when implementing Standards-based mathematics instruction.

"During her first year of teaching, Angie participated in a professional development program designed for first-year middle school mathematics teachers to help them teach in a manner consistent with NCTM’s Principles and Standards. The model for this program included two major components: a support group and classroom coaching. The model was based on the adult learning principle that participants naturally seek out additional education because they have a problem to solve (Zemke and ",10,mtms2011-12-282a,,
"Zemke 1984). Both components of the model were structured around the concerns that teachers expressed related to their instruction. Angie participated in four coaching sessions with an experienced mathematics teacher. In one session, the experienced teacher served in the role of assistant; in three sessions, the experienced teacher served in the role of co-teacher. All four sessions included a preconference and a postconference. ",11,mtms2011-12-282a,,
"Angie also participated in a support group as part of the professional development experience. This support group included four other first-year middle school mathematics teachers and the same experienced teacher who led the classroom coaching. Each meeting’s focus was agreed on by the group at the conclusion of the previous support group meeting. The teachers engaged in problem-solving discussions, examined case studies related to the topic, and shared strategies related to the area of focus. Angie enjoyed the support group meetings,  because they gave her a vision of how Standards-based mathematics should appear as well as specific strategies for attaining this vision in her own classroom. She expressed this thought:",12,mtms2011-12-282a,,
I feel like our discussions about task demand have been helpful. This taking-it-to-a-new-level stuff feels like the heart of teaching math well. I’m looking forward to working on student explanations. I feel like this is an area where I could improve a lot. I tend to fill in the gaps of student knowledge without realizing it.,13,mtms2011-12-282a,,

"It was apparent throughout the professional development session that classroom management was a major issue that had to be addressed. The teachers were interested in implementing Standards-based mathematics instruction and had concerns related to instruction aligned with Principles and Standards; however, those instructional concerns were secondary to classroom management concerns. The teachers seemed to view everything through the filter of classroom management, that is, what issues related to classroom management were likely to surface when implementing Standards-based mathematics instruction.",15,mtms2011-12-282a,,
" An example of this phenomenon occurred during one coaching session. Angie had decided that she wanted to focus on asking good questions during the lesson. She was concerned about the weak class discussions during the summaries of lessons and felt that this area could be improved if she asked her students better questions. During the preconference, we brainstormed good questions that she could ask during the lesson summary. However, during the lesson, Angie struggled with leading the discussion because she was interrupted by groups of students hav- table 1 Concerns and reasons are countered with management strategies to aid the novice teacher.  instructional concern",16,mtms2011-12-282a,,

"During the postconference, we  discussed two classroom management strategies to deal with the problem she experienced during the lesson. ",45,mtms2011-12-282a,,
"The first idea was having the students leave the small groups they were working in and go back to their original seats before beginning the wholeclass discussion. The second idea was to give the groups chart paper during the exploration activity to record their thinking so that it could be shared  with the class during the summary discussion. When Angie implemented those strategies in later lessons, the behavioral issues began to improve. She could then turn her focus back to her original concern of questioning.",46,mtms2011-12-282a,,
"The filter of classroom management seemed to guide considerations  about, and the guidance that supported, Standards-based mathematics instruction. However, a dynamic and reciprocal interaction occurred between the two: Better classroom management helped instruction, but improving instruction also helped classroom management. This filter has implications for experienced educators who support beginning teachers. Every conversation about instruction needs to couple the goal of improving instruction with practical classroom management concerns.",47,mtms2011-12-282a,,
"These data support the research  of Hall and Hord (2000), who found that beginning teachers tend to focus more on task concerns related to implementing an innovation than on addressing concerns about how the innovation will impact their students’ learning. Although it seems logical that these first-year teachers are focused on low-level indicators of implementation, it does not imply that their concerns should be dismissed until they are ready to implement Standards-based mathematics instruction at a higher level. By addressing the concerns the teachers actually had, the professional development session was meeting their needs and allowing for a scaffolding of higher levels of instruction.  stRategies",48,mtms2011-12-282a,,
"It was clear that strategies were important in supporting the teachers as they learned to implement Standards-based mathematics instruction. Although it was not the intention at the beginning of the professional development model to create a list of strategies that teachers could use in their classrooms, these lists evolved. Some strategies were suggested by the coach; others were offered by beginning teachers themselves for one another. During the support group meetings and coaching sessions, the countenance of the teachers changed  when a strategy was offered that gave them a tangible way to make this type of instruction happen in their classrooms (see table 1).",49,mtms2011-12-282a,,
"At the end of the year, Angie felt  that she had made great strides in classroom management, thus impacting her instruction in a positive way. One helpful strategy was evident in Angie’s ability to engage students in the task portion of the lesson. During an observation at the beginning of the professional development, Angie gave the students a task to explore in groups. It took her approximately seven minutes to form the students in groups and get them on task. After implementing one of the strategies discussed and using a timer for transitions, Angie reduced the transition time from whole-group to smallgroup discussions. By using a timer and telling students that they had one minute to choose a partner and get settled, all were engaged in the task in approximately three minutes. ",50,mtms2011-12-282a,,
"Angie has definite ideas she wants  to implement next year to establish a Standards-based classroom and reach the vision of “excited kids, motivated to solve interesting problems.” She stated that she would begin group work gradually, starting with two, then three, then groups of four students. This plan will ensure that she can manage the students in partner work before moving to the more challenging larger groups. She is confidently pursuing a path toward her vision of Standards-based mathematics instruction. ",51,mtms2011-12-282a,,
"Although veteran teachers, curriculum specialists, and college professors can often take classroom management for granted, the new teacher cannot. Our duty as experienced educators is to give those new teachers practical steps to help them reach their instructional goals of aligning mathematics learning with NCTM’s Principles and Standards.",52,mtms2011-12-282a,,
