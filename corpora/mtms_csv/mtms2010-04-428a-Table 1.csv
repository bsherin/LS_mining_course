"Technology in Middle  School Mathematics the following position on “The Role of Technology in the Teaching and Learning of Mathematics”:  iIn March 2008, NCTM adopted ",13,mtms2010-04-428a,,
"Technology is an essential tool for learning mathematics in the 21st century and all schools must ensure that all their students have access to technology. Effective teachers maximize the potential of technology to develop students’ understanding, stimulate their interest, and increase their proficiency in mathematics. When technology is used strategically, it can provide access to mathematics for all students.",14,mtms2010-04-428a,,
"We are pleased to present this focus  issue on technology, which explores how technology has been, and can be, used to better teach middle-grades mathematics. The possibilities continue to unfold. ",15,mtms2010-04-428a,,
"Several articles describe effective uses of specific technological tools, which support vital components of high quality middle-grades mathematics instruction. Geometry software can help develop spatial visualization, which is not always emphasized or taught. In “Constructing Spatial Understanding,” Samuel Obara shares three tasks in which his students designed, constructed, explored, and manipulated threedimensional figures and their associated two-dimensional nets using dynamic geometry software.",16,mtms2010-04-428a,,
"Middle-grades students enjoy looking at aerial photographs generated from Google Earth of both  famous and local sites. In “Map Scale, Proportion, and Google Earth,”  Martin C. Roberge and Linda L. Cooper present an appealing, novel setting for mathematical exploration: aerial photography from both the students’ own neighborhood and from around the world. Using Google Earth free software, students discover the concept of map scale and then reason proportionally about the relationship between the image size and the actual ground size of familiar objects and landmarks.",17,mtms2010-04-428a,,
"Not only does “Making Technology Work” by Tanja Soucie, Nikol Radovi´c, and Renata Svedrec provide lesson ideas using calculators effectively, it also encourages readers to think deeply about the purposes for using technology with their students. Helping students see and understand when a calculator is not advantageous in performing a calculation is made clear in the student versus calculator sets of exercises. Engaging students in the interdisciplinary Weather Project allows them to integrate technology with assessment and connect their mathematical and computer skills with science and geography.

"Providing a context in which we   use technology today, Thomas G.  Edwards and S. Aslı Özgün-Koca share excerpts from NCTM’s Yearbooks and Standards’ documents that mention studying quadratic functions. Their article, “A Historical Perspective from a to c,” explores how available technologies (spreadsheets and graphing calculators, including the ",19,mtms2010-04-428a,,
TI-nspire) in past years could be used to do the tasks suggested in the reform documents and how improvements in those technologies have actually enriched the activities. ,20,mtms2010-04-428a,,
"Comparing and selecting appropriate technology can support effective teaching. Teachers of diverse learners— particularly ELL, special education, and struggling students—will find “Tech-Knowledgy and Diverse Learners” by Jennifer M. Suh a valuable resource. The Tech-Knowledgy planning guide is an insightful tool that will help teachers and teacher educators match the technology capabilities with ways that the specific technology can help address the needs of diverse learners. ",21,mtms2010-04-428a,,
In “Graphing Calculators as ,22,mtms2010-04-428a,,
"Tools,” Christine A. Browning and Gina Garza-Kling consider the specialized knowledge of TPACK— technology, pedagogy, and content knowledge—that is needed to make effective use of technology when teaching math. Focusing on mathematical tasks that use the graphing calculator, Browning and Garza-Kling share activities that span the spectrum of algebra, geometry, measurement, data analysis, and probability.",23,mtms2010-04-428a,,
"As you read these articles, we hope that they will inspire you to try some of the ideas and activities with your students and encourage you to think deeply about your use of technology in teaching mathematics. ",24,mtms2010-04-428a,,
