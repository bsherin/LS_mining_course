The Free Graphing Calculator ( Jockusch 2010) app can be downloaded and accessed to introduce graphs of quadratic equations and the relevant vocabulary, including axis of symmetry, roots, maxima, minima, and vertices. The app helps students visualize the terms and provides a strong conceptual background for future lessons. After the exploration, students can model their new knowledge by using the free app Skitch (Evernote Corp. 2012) to compare and contrast quadratic equation families and apply vocabulary that they learned during the calculator activity. Both of the free apps, the Free Graphing Calculator and Skitch, are available from the Apple App store. ",4,Quick Reads: Using iPads to Explore Parabolas

8,Quick Reads: Using iPads to Explore Parabolas,"In my classroom, we fi rst graphed  y = x2 and discussed the terms axis of symmetry, roots, vertex, maximum, and minimum. We then graphed the quadratic family— •  y = x2; •  y = 2x2; and •  y = 4x2 and analyzed how the changes in the lead coeffi cient affected the parabola (see fi g. 1). After viewing how increasing the coeffi cient of x2 made the parabola narrower, the key question that students addressed was how to make the parabola wider. Many students felt that making the lead coeffi cient a negative number would accomplish this task. However, after exploration, they found that a negative leading coeffi cient only turns a parabola “upside-down.” This discovery enabled ",8,Quick Reads: Using iPads to Explore Parabolas

It also allowed us to include fractions in our exploration because students found that using a fraction whose absolute value was less than 1 as the coefficient of x2 would widen the parabola (see fig. 2).,13,Quick Reads: Using iPads to Explore Parabolas

This led to a discussion of the constant being the y-intercept and how this compares with a linear equation. Following that, we graphed the following: to show the parabola’s horizontal shift (see fig. 4). This family of quadratic functions allowed us to discuss the changes in the axis of symmetry. If time permits, students can experiment with different ways to widen the parabola and move it horizontally and vertically at the same time.",15,Quick Reads: Using iPads to Explore Parabolas

Students received a family of quadratic equations to graph using the Free Graphing Calculator app. After taking a screen shot of the graphed equations, students inserted the picture into Skitch. This app allowed them to label the appropriate parts of the parabola and compare and contrast roots, axes of symmetry, and vertices of the families. The following three families of equations were used for this assessment:  1.  y = –x2, y = –3x2, and y = –6x2 2.  y = –x2, y = –x2 + 7, y = –x2 – 5   (see fig. 5) 3.  y = –x2, y = –(x + 5)2, y = –(x – 4)2",22,Quick Reads: Using iPads to Explore Parabolas

The lesson that followed this activity—graphing quadratic equations by identifying the axis of symmetry and vertex—went much more smoothly this year (see fig. 6) than it has in the past. Students did not struggle with the vocabulary and its meaning in relation to the graph, which enabled a much easier transition from the equation to the graph than in previous years.

Students were receptive to creating the document and showing their knowledge of the vocabulary. They liked having an assessment that was not  paper-based and applying their creative skills through the use of colorcoding in the app. The following day, during the Graphing of Parabolas lesson, one student stated, “This is easy!” The graphing lesson went smoothly, which was a pleasant surprise after previous years of teaching this content.

28,Quick Reads: Using iPads to Explore Parabolas,"During the exploration activity,  students visualized the many vocabulary words associated with quadratic equations. This conceptual understanding of quadratics will enable students to meet the subsequent standard of being able to “graph . . . quadratic functions and show intercepts, maxima, and minima” (CCSSI 2010, p. 69). Students used a technological tool to visualize a concept and make predictions of the results when altering the equations, thus meeting key technology standards. During the assessment activity, students used technology to communicate what they had learned in a digital format (ISTE NET-S, ISTE 2007). By exploring quadratic equation families and learning vocabulary in advance, students gained the contextual knowledge and experiences needed to succeed in graphing quadratic equations in future lessons.
