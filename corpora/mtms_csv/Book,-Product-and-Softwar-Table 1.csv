The facilitator’s guide provides teacher leaders with a detailed plan, including guided questions and video cases, for nurturing teachers’ analytic skills through focused study of the casebook lessons. The materials provide an opportunity for teachers to become leaders of classrooms in which they know how to listen to learners explain their mathematical thinking and to recognize deep sense making. The facilitator’s guide includes nuts-and-bolts information, like agendas and handouts, as well as anecdotal reﬂ ections drawn from a composite of several teacher leaders who have used the guide in professional development experiences. For example, one participant (a fourthgrade teacher) commented, “I have learned to listen hard for the ideas my students are trying to express.” ",7,"Book, Product and Software Reviews"
8,"Book, Product and Software Reviews","This reviewer had some concerns about accuracy. At one point, a child is quoted as saying “in two halves”— a possible misprint for “into halves.” In discussing cases, the facilitator’s guide sometimes uses line numbers (e.g., on page 73, “Also in case 8, consider the thinking of Junior in lines 73–85”) and sometimes not (“Explain the difference between the thinking of Caroline and Roger at the beginning of the case”). It might be useful to have a note explaining why line references are included or omitted.",8,"Book, Product and Software Reviews"
9,"Book, Product and Software Reviews","Despite these concerns, chapter by  chapter, grade by grade, the investigators demonstrate profound classroom credibility. They masterfully  navigate participants toward knowing how to evaluate students’ mathematics thinking as it plays out in a classroom. They have analyzed real cases with remarkable insight and relied on tenets of research. Moreover, there is transparency in their analyses, so that teachers themselves learn to develop that same keen expertise. Participants will come away able to tease out relevant bits of student thinking through watching students interact with multiple representations and listening to them explain their thinking.

The fi rst section includes a review of the research on the importance of parent involvement and home–school partnerships. Topics include literacy and math development, the impact of parent involvement on overall learning and motivation, math anxiety, and strategies for homework help. In the second and third sections, the authors share various research-based strategies for supporting language arts and mathematics learning. In literacy, examples include reading formats, print concepts, and grade-appropriate reading skills. Sample topics explored to support mathematical thinking include number sense, procedures, and algorithms.",61,"Book, Product and Software Reviews"

Each section contains FAQs, including commonly posed parent questions, followed by the authors’ recommendations. The authors have touched on the very important topic of engaging parents in their child’s learning. Being both a K–grade 8 math and reading specialist and now a preservice math instructor, I recommend this book as a supplement to a college- or graduatelevel education course or as a reference guide for teachers. However, when a small sample of parents (10) from varying academic and socioeconomic backgrounds were asked whether they would choose this book independently, the consensus was that the book was too dense—small font size, too few charts and images, and a reading level too high for a general audience.
