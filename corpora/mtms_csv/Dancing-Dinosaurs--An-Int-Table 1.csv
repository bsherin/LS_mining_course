The teacher silences the rambunctious students and begins with the words, “Please get out your formula sheets and notebooks. We are going to learn about area.” The teacher can almost see students’ thoughts of a fun math lesson flying out the window, along with their prospects for an appealing, problem-solving class experience. One way we have found to address the issue of covering needed mathematics skills in a fun, innovative manner is to look for ways to integrate multiple subjects into an extended mathematics activity.

If that can happen by leveraging the excitement that students experience in those disciplines, that is even better. ",5,Dancing Dinosaurs: An Interdisciplinary Mathematics Lesson
6,Dancing Dinosaurs: An Interdisciplinary Mathematics Lesson,"For this article, we explored the idea of creating a multidisciplinary lesson that connected mathematics, science, and literature. We drew inspiration from the children’s book Dinosaurumpus! by Tony Mitton (2002). In the book, dinosaurs of all kinds congregate to romp, stomp, and dance. In so doing, the dinosaurs would certainly create large and unusual footprints; we saw these potential footprints as a great opportunity for a mathematics lesson. We used Pattern Shapes (Clarity Innovations 2015), a free pattern-block application for tablets, to model the dinosaur footprints with common geometric shapes such as triangles, squares, parallelograms, hexagons, and trapezoids. Students were given iPads®, as well as physical pattern blocks, to complete the activ- ity. Although students used physical and virtual manipulatives, they could actually complete the activity with the app, manipulatives, or even just pattern block paper. The activity took approximately 50–80 minutes to complete.",6,Dancing Dinosaurs: An Interdisciplinary Mathematics Lesson

8,Dancing Dinosaurs: An Interdisciplinary Mathematics Lesson,"At the beginning of the lesson, the teacher read the book Dinosaurumpus to the students. The book is silly, fun, and written for preschool students, but it contains various types of dinosaurs. This information allowed us to make connections to paleontology and to the middle school science standards, emphasizing structure and function in living systems and diversity and adaptation of organisms. The teacher then launched the mathematics activity by giving students a handout, which asked students working together in groups of 2–4 to examine and try to recreate the dance steps of “Matharidon,” a hypothetical twofooted dinosaur, who had left behind  footprints after dancing the night away (see fig. 1). ",8,Dancing Dinosaurs: An Interdisciplinary Mathematics Lesson
9,Dancing Dinosaurs: An Interdisciplinary Mathematics Lesson,"Matharidon’s dance moves had been premade on the student handout by the teacher using the Pattern Shapes app (Clarity Innovations 2015), an application in which the user can create geometric-based pictures by selecting shapes from the left tool bar. The tool bar at the bottom of the screen also allows users to complete various commands, including changing the color and size of the shapes. To change the orientation of the shapes, one may just manipulate the selected shape. After the desired dance moves had been made, the teacher took a screenshot of the image, emailed the picture to herself, and then later copied and pasted it into the activity. ",9,Dancing Dinosaurs: An Interdisciplinary Mathematics Lesson
10,Dancing Dinosaurs: An Interdisciplinary Mathematics Lesson,"One thing our students noticed  right away is that the footprints overlapped. This meant that students had to use critical-thinking skills to create a dance pattern that would have made sense as the dinosaur danced. Multiple solutions are possible, and once the students had a solution, they stood up to act out the dance steps. As they got up and showed off their dance moves, the teacher had a chance to assess their thinking and often led the groups to reconsider the sequence of steps and change their solution. The students each then labeled the footprints on their handouts to indicate their agreed-on sequence of dance steps (see fig. 2 for an example solution).",10,Dancing Dinosaurs: An Interdisciplinary Mathematics Lesson

Figure 5 illustrates the typical work of groups who used the green equilateral triangle as the basis for their area calculations. Most groups who chose this kind of technique approximated the overlapped footprints, which resulted in some calculation error. For example, fi gure 5 illustrates how that group found that each footprint consisted of 7 green pattern-block-sized triangles, so that 35 triangles would comprise 5 whole footprints. The remaining 3 partial footprints were then decomposed into approximately 12 green pattern block triangles. The group also calculated that the area of the total fl oor contained 207 green pattern block triangles, but provided no justifi cation for their reasoning. Thus, their approximate area for the fl oor that Matharidon covered was 47/207 or 23 percent. ",31,Dancing Dinosaurs: An Interdisciplinary Mathematics Lesson
32,Dancing Dinosaurs: An Interdisciplinary Mathematics Lesson,"Figure 6 illustrates another  example of student work in which students used estimation.

33,Dancing Dinosaurs: An Interdisciplinary Mathematics Lesson,"Some groups of students tried to decompose their footprints into triangles to apply the basic formula for the area of a triangle to compute areas of the individual triangles.

34,Dancing Dinosaurs: An Interdisciplinary Mathematics Lesson,"Since students calculated the area  of Matharidon’s dance moves fi rst, they could check their answers as a class to ensure that they were calculating correctly before fi nding the area of their dinosaur’s path. This was a helpful realization for some groups who felt uneasy about their method of  finding area. Most students included some form of estimation, so they knew their answers should be similar and probably not exactly the same as other groups. As was seen previously, there was some slight variation in answers for Matharidon’s area because of the overlap in footprints, but most student answers to the percentage of the “dance floor” covered by the dinosaur were similar to one another.

36,Dancing Dinosaurs: An Interdisciplinary Mathematics Lesson,"Most students showed enthusiasm and excitement during the lesson.

Once students understood a strategy that would work to find the area, they completed the measurements more easily, often by using estimation.

37,Dancing Dinosaurs: An Interdisciplinary Mathematics Lesson,We enjoyed developing this lesson  because of the unusual ways that it builds students’ understanding of area and ratio while making connections to reading and science. We hope that it illustrates how integrating different disciplines can be fun for both teachers and students and that it can help students see the relevance of mathematics to their everyday experiences. ,37,Dancing Dinosaurs: An Interdisciplinary Mathematics Lesson
