1,The Sports Bag (October 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Jacob Wooton submitted his reflections and the work of his seventh-grade students from Cedarwood Waldorf School in Portland, Oregon, for this month’s Solve It problem. Wooton reported that he used this problem as a challenge for about half of his class during a week of test review. Students worked in a large group to read and plan solutions to the problem. While working collaboratively, his students developed formulas, drew diagrams to show the layout of the pieces, and discussed how the circumference of the circle related to the missing length of one edge of the rectangle. They realized that one edge of the bag would need to wrap around the circle to form the end.",,
2,The Sports Bag (October 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In figure 1, Haley described what she thought about the relationship between the circular end piece and the dimensions of the rectangle. She computed the circumference of the circle as 25 (or 78.5 cm), so that the dimensions of the rectangle would be 78.5 cm × 60 cm. Knowing that there should be a 2 cm seam allowance along each side, she determined that she would need to cut an 83 cm (rounding 78.5 to 79 and adding the 4 cm seam allowance) × 64 cm rectangle from the fabric. The fabric needed for the circular end, including seam allowance, was also shown as a circle with a 29 cm diameter. In addition, Haley found the area of each circular end piece of fabric to be 600.1 cm2.",,

4,The Sports Bag (October 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Wooton recounted that the main disagreement that evolved among his students centered around the seam allowance for the circular end piece and how this number would affect the length of the rectangle. Some students wanted to add the seam allowance before determining the circumference, whereas others felt that the seam allowance should be added after determining the circumference. He reported that it took conversations over three days to convince some of the students to find the missing dimension of the rectangle without adding the seam allowance. Adding the seam allowance before determining the length of the missing side of the rectangle would have made the rectangle too long because the finished end piece was supposed to have a diameter of 25 cm, not 29 cm. Eli explained his seam-allowance thinking in figure 2.",,

6,The Sports Bag (October 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Wooton and a parent had previously worked in the garment industry and wondered if another challenge could be presented. When making the pattern for only one bag, unused fabric remained in the corner. What if students were asked to use the least amount of fabric? Would laying out multiple bags save fabric in the long run? Wooton and the parent discussed this idea with Lola, who ended up laying out a pattern for three bags at a time (see fig. 3). This idea would save more than 1/10 m2 of cloth.",,

8,The Sports Bag (October 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,THE EDITORS’ REFLECTION ON THE TASK,,
9,The Sports Bag (October 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,We were delighted to hear about Wooton’s added challenge and Lola’s thoughtful work. It is our hope that the published Solve It tasks will spark extensions and conversations among students and between students and teachers. Tasks that interest parents who then join the conversation contain an added bonus.,,
10,The Sports Bag (October 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Both the NCTM Communication Standard and the Common Core’s Standards for Mathematical Practice encourage the construction of viable arguments and the critiquing of others’ reasoning. We are, therefore, encouraged to hear that Wooton took class time to allow these opportunities for discussion and to share how his students learned from these conversations.",,
11,The Sports Bag (October 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Learning theory suggests that when students are asked to think critically, evaluate the reasoning of others, and justify their own conclusions, their own knowledge becomes rich in connections and their understanding increases. This problem also provided the opportunity for students to model with mathematics, another of the Common Core’s Standards for Mathematical Practice. While students used their prior knowledge about rectangles, circles, and measurement to solve this problem, they recognized how math is used in everyday life.",,
12,The Sports Bag (October 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We appreciate Jacob Wooton providing us with his reflections and regret that space limitations prohibit us from publishing the work of each student who was willing to share his or her work with MTMS readers. All submitted work by students was admirable, and these middle school students’ work samples provide the focus for the Solve It department.",,
