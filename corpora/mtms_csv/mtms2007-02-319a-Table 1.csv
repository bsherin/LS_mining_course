Buy the Gallon or Buy the Pound? 1. 18 gallons of gas – 13.5 gallons of gas = 4.5 gallons of gas; 4.5 × $3.30 = $14.85.,8,mtms2007-02-319a,,
"2. $56.10 ÷ $3.30 = 17 gallons that were purchased to refill his tank; miles/gallon = 255/17, which is 15 mpg.  3.  One  possible  answer  is  that  since  $2.59  is  “dollars  per pound,” he would divide the selling price by the weight of the car.",9,mtms2007-02-319a,,
"4. 1.5 tons = 3,000 pounds (1 ton = 2,000 pounds), so 3,000 pounds × $2.59/pound = $7,770.00.",10,mtms2007-02-319a,,

"A Taxing Day! 1. P(august 6) = 1/31 2.  If  august  6  is  a  Saturday,  then  the  month  started  on  a Monday.  The  weekends  would  be  august  6,  7;  13,  14;  20, 21; and 27, 28. The P(weekend) = 8/31. Since 8/31 is close  to 8/32, or 1/4, the probability is approximately 25 percent. Some students may note that there are four weekends in the month of august as described, so there is a 1 in 4 chance, thus 25 percent.",12,mtms2007-02-319a,,
"3. an odd date has a greater probability. august has sixteen odd dates (1, 3, . . . , 31) and only fifteen even dates (2, 4, . . . , 30), so P(odd) = 16/31 and P(even) = 15/31.",13,mtms2007-02-319a,,
"4. It could occur in a month containing 30 days (april, June, September,  or  November)  and  five  Mondays.  In  that  case, the P = 5/30, or 1/6. The month would have to start on a Sunday or a Monday for five Mondays to occur. l",14,mtms2007-02-319a,,
