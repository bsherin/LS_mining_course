3,"Book, Product, _ Software Reviews (April 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Amid standardization and high-stakes accountability efforts that have failed to narrow achievement gaps or fulfill broader equity goals, examples of successful, urban, mathematics programs meeting the needs of racially, linguistically, and socio-economically diverse students are few and far between. This highly engaging book tells the story of the creation and eventual demise of an exemplary program enacted over a twenty-five-year period by teachers in the mathematics department at Railside secondary school. The book includes contributions of former teachers, university researchers, and students. Sections describe the features of the Railside approach, students' experiences, teacher learning and professional community, and lessons learned.",,
4,"Book, Product, _ Software Reviews (April 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","The authors provide a range of information useful to middle-grades educators interested in equitable pedagogy, be they classroom teachers, school-level teacher-leaders, supervisors, or teacher educators. For example, section 1 includes an analysis of the sources of the program's success, including the department and program structure; curriculum; complex instruction; and the uses of both group work and high cognitive demand tasks, with an emphasis on effort over ability. Later, Railside teachers self-identify and provide examples of essential elements of their pedagogy, including detracked classes, group-worthy tasks, multiple representations, big ideas, justification, and student presentations. Another chapter highlights one teacher's practice with nuanced examples that demonstrate her accountability systems for productive group work.",,
5,"Book, Product, _ Software Reviews (April 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","The Railside story is complex and thought-provoking. It has the potential to spark rich conversations around current obstacles to equity and how teachers
  

  might collaborate to meet the needs of their most marginalized students.",,

11,"Book, Product, _ Software Reviews (April 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Mathematics Lessons Learned from Across the World

  presents mathematics activities with an international flair. Johnny W. Lott and Carolyn J. Lott introduce math teachers to classroom-tested activities from six different continents that cover learning from prekindergarten through eighth grade. The lessons illuminate concepts discussed at the International Congress on Mathematics Education held in Korea in 2012.",,
12,"Book, Product, _ Software Reviews (April 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","These activities support the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics and allow students to experience math from an international point of view. Most, if not all, of these activities definitely answer the student's frequent question: Where does math fit in real-world applications?",,
13,"Book, Product, _ Software Reviews (April 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","It might seem that the materials involved are exotic, but almost everything a teacher needs to be able to teach these activities in a classroom is probably already on hand. The lessons also include notes, references, and activity sheets. Many of these lessons are perfect for differentiation, as multiple tasks and extensions are provided for most of the lessons.",,
14,"Book, Product, _ Software Reviews (April 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","One of my favorite activities is from Germany and involves number pyramids. This particular lesson is extremely rich and covers concepts from addition and subtraction with operative variations; introduction to algebra, including patterns; and Pascal's triangle. The only material necessary is the provided activity sheet. On a differentiation basis, parts of this activity are suitable for first through sixth grade; it would also be suitable for a resource classroom in the higher grades.",,
15,"Book, Product, _ Software Reviews (April 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics",This book is a wonderful approach to keeping students excited about math and could easily be used in a cross-curricular approach.,,

Concrete, pictorial, algebraic, and word problems offer a great variety of representations within the deck. A team set of blank cards is also included. The cards themselves seem sturdy, and the font and pictures are appropriate for middle school level students.",,
23,"Book, Product, _ Software Reviews (April 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","The cards can be used to learn new information, as formative assessment, or to review content. Teachers can plan groups in advance by sorting the cards according to their answers, which are conveniently located in the accompanying teacher guide. The reverse side of each card is labeled with a group role, and the guide provides easy-to-understand suggestions for facilitating the group roles. The website provided in the guide offers additional tasks once the students are grouped.",,

30,"Book, Product, _ Software Reviews (April 2015) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Intentional Talk: How to Structure and Lead Productive Mathematical Discussions

  provides guidelines and examples for leading structured mathematical talks in an elementary classroom. The book provides one chapter on ""open strategy sharing"" and then a chapter each on five different types of structured mathematical discussions (such as ""Why? Let's Justify"" and ""Define and Clarify""). The authors clearly describe how and when to employ each type of discussion for particular goals; they also include templates in the back of the book for planning the discussions. Each chapter includes dialogue from mathematics classrooms at different grade levels, from kindergarten through fifth grade. Although the examples are a bit lengthy, they do provide excellent guidance for new teachers or for teachers just learning to include discussions in their instruction. More experienced teachers might find helpful the clear lists in each chapter of when and how to use each type of discussion, question stems for teachers and students, and examples of norms for discussions. 
  Intentional Talk

  will help elementary school teachers (and possibly middle school teachers as well) create and refine productive mathematical discussions in their classroom.",,
