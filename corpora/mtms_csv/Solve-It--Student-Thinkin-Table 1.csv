8,Solve It: Student Thinking: Lemon Tea?,"Corpus Christi, Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Unit 5825, 6300 Ocean Drive, Corpus Christi, TX 78412-5825. Published solutions will be credited.  sStudents used a variety of representa- tions—pictures, symbols, numerical reasoning, and written descriptions— to model the problem. The majority of students used a drawing to help them make sense of the situation. The chief variation in the drawings occurred in the units representing the amount of lemonade or iced tea. The following examples of student work exemplify the differences in the strategies used to solve the problem. Students who used pictorial  representations often started with a drawing of two pitchers, followed by a second drawing of the two pitchers after the pint of lemonade had been poured into the ice tea. Figure 1’s drawing, answering question 1, was produced by Addie and Kayano, who are students of Jacob Wooton. Their work clearly shows the pouring of the pints of liquid from one container to the other and back. However, a full explanation is missing of how they determined the correct amounts of lemonade and ice tea that were poured back into the lemonade pitcher after the mixing process. Determining ",8,Solve It: Student Thinking: Lemon Tea?
9,Solve It: Student Thinking: Lemon Tea?,"Fig. 1 Addie and Kayano’s work on question 1 did not contain a complete solution to the problem.  these amounts seemed to be a stumbling block and a source of errors in other students’ work. Another teacher, Walter Stark, specifically discussed this issue in relation to his sixth-grade classroom, stating that “it was the mixing part that confused them.” When Stark realized that many  students were stuck at that point, he initiated a whole-class discussion about the issue. He prompted students to talk to one another about how much of each liquid moved back into the lemonade container. Jenna said, “It would contain some of the lemonade and some of the iced tea.” But when asked how much of each, many students thought it would be 1/2 and 1/2. However, Alexa said it could not be 1/2 and 1/2 because the second container was not 1/2 lemonade and 1/2 iced tea. This led to a lot of student discussion but no solid conclusions. Stark allowed them to think about it for some time, left the problem as is, and put it on hold for a week.",9,Solve It: Student Thinking: Lemon Tea?
10,Solve It: Student Thinking: Lemon Tea?,"When he revisited the task, he  asked if the students remembered the  question and if anyone had thought more about it. Some students could easily repeat what they had worked on and where they got stuck, but none felt they had the answer. Then Emilia said she thought it would be easier to see what was happening if they broke the quarts into pints, cups, or another measure. Emilia’s work, shown in figure 2, used cups instead of quarts. Using pictorial representations and descriptions helped her justify her work. Stark’s discussion about changing to smaller units helped more of his students successfully solve the problem, but it still allowed for a variety of measures, such as pints, cups, and ounces.

19,Solve It: Student Thinking: Lemon Tea?,"First I drew out the pitchers and wrote their amounts on each drink. I then followed the directions and drew an extra pint of lemonade in the tea pitcher. I then figured out that if you were to divide that mixture into three different parts, how much of each drink is in each pint so that I know how much more of each drink to add back to the lemonade pitcher.",19,Solve It: Student Thinking: Lemon Tea?
20,Solve It: Student Thinking: Lemon Tea?,"Her work changed from pictures to fractional amounts after pouring the first pint of lemonade in the iced tea. Even during the second exchange, she drew the pictures first, then used computation to determine the second answer. ",20,Solve It: Student Thinking: Lemon Tea?
21,Solve It: Student Thinking: Lemon Tea?,"Alice, another student in Wooton’s  class, used drawings to organize her information and then recorded everything as algebraic expressions within the drawings (see fig. 4). Although Alice did not formally define her variables, she consistently used “I” to represent a quart of iced tea and “L” to represent a quart of lemonade. As the mixing of liquids occurred, she relabeled each pitcher to show what was in it at that time, without trying to partition the pitchers to show fractional parts. ",21,Solve It: Student Thinking: Lemon Tea?
22,Solve It: Student Thinking: Lemon Tea?,"Only a few of the student work  samples that were submitted did not use drawings. For example, Annarose, who is also in Wooton’s class, reasoned quantitatively through the problem using ounces (see fig. 5). It is interesting to note that Annarose was one of the few students who also chose to use repeating decimals rather than fractions. We are left to wonder if the student knew that 47.9 ounces was the same as 48 ounces. It is noteworthy that  this student could complete both problems 1 and 2 in this manner and had no difficulty adding repeating decimals. ",22,Solve It: Student Thinking: Lemon Tea?

24,Solve It: Student Thinking: Lemon Tea?,"Responses to the extension problem were mixed (no pun intended).  However, Alex, a student in Sharon  Hurwich’s class, clearly understood what was occurring when he said, “No, you will never get 1/2 lemonade and 1/2 iced tea in one pitcher because the difference between two items in one pitcher is always getting smaller yet never reached zero there, for it will never be 1/2 lemonade and 1/2 iced tea in one pitcher.” This student’s work on the first two parts was similar to others who used drawings to organize numerical data. Hurwich said that this student spent many hours drawing other pictures and making additional calculations that helped him reason abstractly. ",24,Solve It: Student Thinking: Lemon Tea?

26,Solve It: Student Thinking: Lemon Tea?,"When first looking at this problem, one might wonder about its accessibility to middle school learners. However, we saw a variety of student solution strategies employed, with different levels of sophistication, which is typical of middle school students. We also saw evidence that teachers used the task in different ways. ",26,Solve It: Student Thinking: Lemon Tea?
27,Solve It: Student Thinking: Lemon Tea?,"Teachers who assigned the task as  a routine problem-solving lesson or as a problem of the week had better completion rates than those who assigned the task for extra credit. When it was part of instruction, the teachers’ reflections showed that the task elicited a lot of student discussion about key ideas related to ratios and fractions. It also required students to think about what happened when liquids were mixed in specific ratios. In fact, each of the teachers who included reflections on the task indicated that they held class discussions for students to share their ideas about the mixed liquids. These class discussions about confusing ideas were key to helping all students be successful at some level. ",27,Solve It: Student Thinking: Lemon Tea?

30,Solve It: Student Thinking: Lemon Tea?,"We received many student responses  to question 1, fewer responses to question 2, and very few responses to the extension. We wish to assure readers that submitting partial work on problems is helpful. Thus, we conclude that this problem allowed for differentiation and that students could successful solve question 1 and be challenged by the extension problem. In fact, we received more interesting submissions than we can show or discuss within our space limitations. This problem proved to be a rich mathematical task that caused students to think deeply about proportionality, an idea that is not always easy for middle school students.",30,Solve It: Student Thinking: Lemon Tea?
