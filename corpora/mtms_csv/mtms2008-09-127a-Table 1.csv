"cartoon corner: humor-Based Mathematics activities Andy Reeves, ed., 2007. 99 pp., $25.95 paper. ISBN 9780873536004. Stock no. 13290. National Council of Teachers of Mathematics; (800) 235-7566; www.nctm.org. ",4,mtms2008-09-127a,,
"Cartoon Corner: Humor-Based Mathematics Activities uses the humor of cartoons to engage middle school students in mathematical  activities. These two-page activities are organized by concept; one page is for student use and the other page contains solutions, field-test comments, and an “Other Ideas” section. Although many students understood the humor in the comics, I found it necessary to discuss the cartoon to ensure that it was understood by English-language learners, exceptional learners, and those students who are very literal. The field-test  comments provide a vignette with results from a teacher’s classroom. I found this helpful when deciding how to use the activity. Some activities are useful for introducing a topic to the whole class, whereas others are better suited for group work, shortened class periods, or as a wrap-up before a unit test. I plan to incorporate a few of the activities in our next Math Night. The “Other Ideas” section suggested ways to extend the book’s activities using Internet resources, advanced mathematical applications of the concepts, and real-world situations.",5,mtms2008-09-127a,,
"My middle school students enjoyed the cartoons so much that they forgot to groan when the classwork began. As they worked in groups on the “ ‘Not So Hairy’ Cut” cartoon, which involves fractions, proportions, and unit conversions, I listened to their conversations. This allowed me to grasp the students’ understanding of several skills at the beginning of the unit and modify my instruction as necessary.",6,mtms2008-09-127a,,
"Another Cartoon Corner suggestion involves cartooning. I can envision asking students to create cartoons to demonstrate their understanding of a specific topic. It would be a unique blend of mathematics and art. Although Cartoon Corner could be used in the upper elementary grades with some modifications, I would recommend this resource primarily for grades 6 to 9.",7,mtms2008-09-127a,,

"Math doesn’t suck: how to survive Middle school Math Without losing Your Mind or Breaking a nail Danica McKellar, 2007. Ages 9–12, 320 pp., $16.29 cloth. ISBN 9781594630392. Hudson Street Press, distrib. by Amazon; www.amazon.com. ",13,mtms2008-09-127a,,
"McKellar’s Math Doesn’t Suck is a very interesting and unusual self-study book for middle school girls. It is currently out in both hardback and paperback. The book has had a lot of publicity because its author is a successful actress, but unfortunately little attention has been given to its innovative content.",14,mtms2008-09-127a,,
"The book’s twenty-one chapters  cover factors; prime factorization; least common multiple and greatest common factor; and decimals, percentages, and fractions and converting among them. There are also word problems, which require comparing fractions, complex fractions, ratios, rates, unit rates, proportions, and unit conversions. The last chapter introduces algebra and “solving for x” word problems. ",15,mtms2008-09-127a,,
"Each chapter opens with a motivating situation from the real life of middle school girls and smoothly introduces abstract mathematical concepts. Then, a step-by step procedure helps the reader do the mathematics. Toward the middle of the book, a Math Horoscope adds some mystery to mathematics. Near the end, an interesting and useful troubleshooting guide gives the book a therapeutic role. Math Doesn’t Suck ends with a resource guide for girls, multiplication tables, an answer key to the exercises, and an index.",16,mtms2008-09-127a,,
"In chapter 2, the author gives  step-by-step procedures for finding the  panning for gold: 15 investigations to enrich Middle school Mathematics Daniel J. Brahier, 2007. 240 pp., $24.50 paper. ISBN 9780325010458. Heinemann; (800) 225-5800; www.heinemann.com. ",17,mtms2008-09-127a,,
"The classroom projects in Panning for Gold cover an array of topics and numerous strands. These handson activities involve mathematical concepts suggested by curriculum standards. I especially like the zip code project, which segues nicely into other activities and other mathematical discoveries. ",18,mtms2008-09-127a,,
"This book takes the approach of  working a concept into your teaching, which I like. Although projects may seem time-consuming, they actually lead to significant mathematics that is relevant to higher-level thinking skills. The activities in this book provide the foundation for further exploration, allowing for individual advancement. Seeing in what areas of mathematics the concepts apply is essential for higher-level learning. I strongly support this book, which offers hands-on opportunities to explore the wonderful world of mathematics.",19,mtms2008-09-127a,,

"GCF in three ways:  (1) the Greatest Crush Factor Method (the name made up to match GCF) uses the listing of the factors of the numbers; (2) the Multiplying Monkeys Method, employing a factor tree for each number, uses monkey illustrations as the prime factors at the bottom of the branches; and (3) the Birthday Cake Method uses division by those numbers that will divide into both numbers then form their product. The Birthday Cake Method generalizes easily to finding the GCF of three or more numbers and is preferred by the author.",21,mtms2008-09-127a,,
"Chapter 6 discusses equivalent  fractions and reducing fractions. The author uses many examples to show that in daily life there is almost always more than one way to say the same thing: “In the language of math, there are lots of ways to express the same number, especially when it comes to fractions.” A story is told about eating half an apple pie by eating 6 small slices of 1/2 of a pie, showing that 6/12 = 1/2. A form of 1 (i.e., a fraction whose numerator and denominator are the same), called a copycat fraction by the author, is used to define equivalent fractions. Then, reducing fractions is described as being the same as taking out the hidden copycats. Dividing versus canceling is clarified by an example such as the following: 12 8 4 12 4 or 12 2 4 3 4",22,mtms2008-09-127a,,
"In the second expression, we cancel 4, which is the GCF of 8 and 12.",23,mtms2008-09-127a,,
It is a well-written book with few errors or misprints. Some minor typos that the author or the readers of the book have found are adjusted in the paperback edition. ,24,mtms2008-09-127a,,
"The author’s explanations are clear,  thought provoking, and convincing; the conversational tone will attract the reader. At the beginning, she emphasizes that mathematics must be read, word for word. I kept reading the  book, word for word, and enjoyed it to the end. I hope that all elementary and middle school mathematics teachers will read the book and enjoy it the way I did. In fact, I believe that it can be interesting reading for all prospective and in-service mathematics teachers. The troubleshooting guide at the end of the book will help teachers be more sensitive and responsible. ",25,mtms2008-09-127a,,
"The book is written for girls in a language that they can identify with and comprehend. However, I think it would be just as useful for boys. Its appropriateness for all middle school students could be made clear by addressing it to both genders. Some examples could easily come from the experiences of boys in the same context. Since the book does not seem to make any distinction between the genders’ abilities for mathematics, it appears that it is intended to encourage girls to be just as good in mathematics as boys. ",26,mtms2008-09-127a,,
"I have taught mathematics for elementary and middle school teachers for the past decade at Brewton-Parker College and Dalton State College in Georgia. The next time I teach this course, I plan to require a copy of Math Doesn’t Suck as supplementary reading for the students, because this is a lively book with many new ideas, teaching techniques, and useful step-by-step procedures. Prospective teachers will learn about copycat fractions, the Birthday Cake Method, the golden math rule, the equation as a balance, the alligator mouth used for the inequality symbol, nicknaming in algebra, and many revealing and encouraging testimonials and anecdotes about mathematics. They will also learn that “math is less complicated than life,” according to the author.",27,mtms2008-09-127a,,
I recommend this book to all prospective and in-service mathematics teachers.,28,mtms2008-09-127a,,
