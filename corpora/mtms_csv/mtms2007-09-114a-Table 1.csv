"Student Approaches to Unitizing in Fair-Share Problems hHow do your students unitize when  solving problems that involve fair sharing? Do they visualize the unit, partition it when needed, and distribute the pieces equally? Can your students explain their thinking and keep track of what they are doing? Unitizing involves identifying a reference unit, such as a box of crayons or a candy bar, based on the problem context; breaking the unit into smaller chunks; and regrouping pieces to make the problem easier to solve (Lamon 1996). It is a way of conceptualizing an amount before, during, and after the sharing process (Lamon 1996). Consider the problem of three  children sharing two pizzas equally. The problem solver first has to think about the unit to be divided. The unit can be visualized as either one pizza, which results in two units, or a set of two pizzas that serve as one unit. In the first scenario, each pizza can be cut into thirds and the pieces distributed evenly to each child. Each child would get two one-third pieces  of pizza, equivalent to two-thirds of one pizza. In the second scenario, the problem solver conceptualizes dividing a single unit into three equal parts, such that each child gets one-third of the two pizzas. Unfortunately, students do not get adequate experience in unitizing processes (Behr, Lesh, Post, and Silver 1983), which are important for developing increasingly sophisticated mathematical ideas (Lamon 1996).  the task: sharing  Packs of guM Explore your students’ approach to unitizing when solving the following fair-sharing problem: ",2,mtms2007-09-114a,,

"student PerforMance After students worked in pairs and solved the problem, they were asked to share their thinking with the class. These responses were typical of the various ways the students approached these problems. ",6,mtms2007-09-114a,,
"Karen’s method Karen explained her method, illustrated in figure 1, as follows: ",7,mtms2007-09-114a,,
"What I did was I drew a table of a box and five stick figures. [Karen outlines a rectangle on the grid chart paper by counting 6 squares horizontally and 5 squares vertically.] There are five kids. [Karen draws 5 stick figures under the square and assigns one of the following symbols to each stick figure in turn: +, –, ÷, ×, ~. She draws grid lines inside the 5 × 6 rectangle. She then fills each of the 5 rows with different symbols starting with the “+.”] Then I figured out what each person got, and I put that in a number sentence. [She writes 5/5.] Then I looked over here [looks at her notebook]. The amount that we are splitting is 5 pieces of gum and 5 children. So I came up with a fraction 5/5. [She was referring to  5 pieces of gum to be split into 5 equal parts.] Then I wrote that as a number sentence and wrote that as 5 ÷ 5 = 1 [writes 5 ÷ 5 = 1pack of gum on chart paper]. Which is a pack of gum. Then I checked my answer [checks answer by performing the inverse opera tion of multiplication: writes 5 × 1 = 5 and labels the 5 as pieces of gum]. So I figured out that each person got 1 pack [points to the vertical column] or 5 pieces of gum. ",8,mtms2007-09-114a,,
"Karen corrected her explanation during a discussion later on. She redrew the matrix (see the second rectangular grid in fig. 1) and indicated that each column represented 1 pack and each square represented a piece. She indicated that each child will receive one  fig. 1 Karen’s method fig. 2 Jack’s and Layne’s methods column (i.e., pack) and one piece of gum. She restated that each child will receive 1 1/5 packs of gum. ",9,mtms2007-09-114a,,
"Jack’s method Jack drew five circles on chart paper (see the top half of fig. 2), then explained: ",10,mtms2007-09-114a,,
"Okay, there are 5 children and 6 packs of gum, so each kid will get one. There are 5 in each pack and there is one pack left. So, each person will get 1/5 [writes 1 1/5 beneath each circle]. ",11,mtms2007-09-114a,,
"Layne’s method Layne drew six rectangles to represent 6 packs of gum (see the bottom half of fig. 2). He divided each rectangle into five parts by drawing vertical lines. He then drew circles to signify each child in the problem context. He distributed the 5 packs among the  5 children by circling each rectangle (pack), assigning it a number 1–5, and recording a corresponding number to the left to account for each child.  He explained that each child will  get 1 1/5 packs. Layne wrote 5/5 to  fig. 3 Sam’s method represent 5 packs divided among  5 children. He numbered the remaining rectangular pieces (each 1/5 of a whole rectangle, or pack) 1–5 to distribute them among the 5 children. (He wrote 6/5, with 1 1/5 beside it, then wrote 5/5 to represent the  5 packs divided among 5 children.) ",12,mtms2007-09-114a,,
"Sam’s method “I noticed that we had 6 packs with  5 pieces each. So I multiplied that and found out that there were 30 pieces” (he recorded the multiplication problem as shown in fig. 3). He then divided it into 5 groups to find each child’s share. Sam concluded that each child will receive 6 pieces. He indicated that it represented 1 1/5 pack. Students visualized the 6 packs of gum with 5 pieces in each pack to be shared equally among 5 children as packs (6 packs), pieces (30 pieces), or both (5 packs and 5 pieces) during the process of problem solving. How students initially visualized the problem context influenced how they thought about distributing and partitioning the unit (a pack of gum) as needed. Some students chunked differentsized parts together to distribute them more efficiently (as did Karen, Jack,  and Layne). Therefore, they only had to focus on either packs or pieces at one time. Sam used multiplication to think about his unit and used division to partition his unit equally. He employed his knowledge of whole numbers to solve the problem. He knew that 6 × 5 is 30 and that multiplying the number of packs by the number of pieces in a pack yields the total amount of gum. He treated the original problem context as 30 pieces. He re-unitized the solution in relation to the original problem context of packs and pieces. In other words, he converted the 6 pieces of gum per child into 1 pack and 1 piece, the latter being 1/5 pack, for a final answer of 1 1/5 pieces of gum per child. Karen and Layne had difficulty keeping track of the unit when explaining their thinking process verbally. Note that this problem may have been less confusing if the number 5 had not been used to represent both the children and the pieces of gum.  discussion Students can visualize and solve this problem in various ways. It may be easier to work with either packs or pieces than to convert between them  during problem solving. The problem was challenging because it involved sharing a composite unit. In other words, the problem could be visualized as packs, or as pieces, or as both. The conceptual processes involved in solving a fair-share problem can be summarized as follows: identifying units within the problem context, partitioning units as needed, distributing pieces, quantifying the resulting group or “share” size, and relating the answer back to the original problem context. A teacher can support students to make sense of the unitizing process (Lamon 1996) by asking students to explain how they are visualizing units in problems. Having students create pictorial representations and then connect key elements to the mathematics content in the problem context can also be helpful in that it forces students to think explicitly about the unit they are working with. Students need to keep track of this unit during each problem-solving phase. Ongoing written and verbal communication facilitates this process (Carpenter, Fennema, and Romberg 1993). The more experience that students get with fair-sharing strategies, the easier it will be in the future to identify, partition, distribute, quantify, and relate the answer to the problem they are trying to solve.  references Behr, Merlyn J., Richard Lesh, Thomas ",13,mtms2007-09-114a,,
