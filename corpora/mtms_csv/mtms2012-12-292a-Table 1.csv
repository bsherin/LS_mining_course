A conceptual framework can show a general education and a special education teacher how to team teach so that a range of students can learn together in today’s classrooms.,2,mtms2012-12-292a,,
"Lisa A. Dieker, Michelle Stephan, and Jennifer Smith tThe merging of the fi elds of special  education and mathematics was never meant to be a recent phenomenon. The true intention of the Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act (1975) was for students with disabilities to remain in the least restrictive environment. However, because mathematics is a content area with the greatest dependency on spiraling curriculum and cumulative knowledge, students with disabilities were often relegated to a self-contained classroom. ",3,mtms2012-12-292a,,
"Research from Dieker and Berg  (2002) shows that many special education teachers have as little as three to six credits of college math courses. It is not surprising that middle school math students with disabilities often test below their peers nationally (Giesen, Cavenaugh, and McDonnall 2012) in light of the potential lack of math preparation of special education teachers, as well as the limited preparation of math teachers to work with students with disabilities. ",4,mtms2012-12-292a,,
"This article reﬂ ects on the positive potential of a merger between general education and special education. With the Common Core State Standards in Mathematics (CCSSI 2010), students with disabilities will be included in math classes that have a higher emphasis on language, vocabulary, and critical thinking and processing skills. With this in mind, this article provides the most common ways that learning issues might present themselves in math class and practical ideas to address these issues. Examples of two co-teachers (Stephan and Smith) using various co-teaching approaches in a Standards-based middle school classroom are also given.",5,mtms2012-12-292a,,

"Students who are accustomed to repeating a single mathematical procedure in multiple contexts typically have diffi culty switching between procedures. They are likely to confuse a process learned in earlier aspects of mathematics with newly introduced information (e.g., when moving from multiplying to dividing fractions).  langUage Students with language issues could often hide this aspect of their disability in math class. However, Common Core–focused mathematics texts contain more vocabulary and fewer procedures in their delivery of content. Issues in language most often are present in reading, speaking, or writing.  •  Reading: Students who have trouble with reading comprehension and fl uency experience greater diffi culty with most mathematics textbooks because more of the content requires reading.  •  Writing: one mathematical practice emphasized in the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics is being able to defend one’s strategy or solution. Typically, this defense is oral, which can create diffi culty for students who are uncomfortable when asked to speak or write. Writing solutions can also cause diffi culty (e.g., keeping numbers in correct columns).",11,mtms2012-12-292a,,
•  Speaking: More and more Standards-based classrooms require group discussions and a defense of solutions. Keep in mind that this type of struggle can create behavior problems and self-esteem issues.,12,mtms2012-12-292a,,

"The three examples are based on the co-teaching practices of Stephan and Smith, who worked together for fi ve years. The general education (GE) teacher had seven years of teaching experience and holds advanced degrees in mathematics. The special education (SE) teacher had seventeen years of experience teaching students with  disabilities. Their co-teaching practice drew on research (Dieker 2006; Dieker and Murawski 2003; Friend and Cook 2006) as well as student-centered mathematics (Hiebert et al. 1997).  teaM-teaching aPPRoach",18,mtms2012-12-292a,,
"In all three of the co-teaching approaches, co-planning and communication have been crucial to working together. In our situation, we had support for our collaboration. Therefore, our class was able to turn into a true team-teaching experience because we were allowed to work together year after year. In addition, we taught two classes together and scheduled a planning period in between. This schedule allowed us to plan daily and adjust our ideas to address the range of diverse learners. The GE took the primary role during the fi rst class period, with the SE playing the secondary role. We discussed the current lesson as well as the next day’s lesson during our coplan period afterward. The SE teacher then took the lead in the second class, with the GE teacher playing a secondary role. ",19,mtms2012-12-292a,,
"Our roles in team teaching are described in the context of teaching integers. We spent our co-planning periods creating a common lesson image (Schoenfeld 2000). A lesson image— •  considers the mathematical  intent of the lesson (e.g., creating several solutions to 10,000 +/- an unknown = 7,000); •  anticipates what solutions (both correct and incorrect) students might invent; •  discusses which students’ reasoning we should capitalize on in class, along with the teacher notation that would support their reasoning (e.g., a vertical number line); and •  elaborates what questions would be useful to ask to elevate or help the conversation ﬂ ow.  table 1 These ideas address typical types of disabilities found in mathematics.",20,mtms2012-12-292a,,

"As we built this lesson image, we  had to think specifically about students who had language issues (speaking and writing); one student who had difficulty reasoning; and one student with Autism Spectrum Disorder, who tended to perseverate on one procedure after he invented it. Throughout this lesson, students in small groups had the following roles: recorder, speaker, and task manager. We ensured that the student with writing issues was not given the role of recorder and that the person who had speaking issues was not the spokesperson. ",60,mtms2012-12-292a,,
"When students were asked to solve  10,000 +/- an unknown = 7,000, the GE teacher noticed that a majority solved it as or as  10,000 + (-3,000)  10,000 - (+3,000). ",61,mtms2012-12-292a,,

"In most team-teaching lessons, the  and class session was divided into three parts: Launch of the lesson (3 to 5 minutes spent posing the problem), student exploration time (15 to 20 minutes of student work), and wholeclass discussion (10 to 20 minutes of analysis). One teacher took the primary role of launching the task and starting the whole-class discussion. Although the SE or GE teacher took the lead when launching the task, we both monitored student exploration time, collecting data on the diverse strategies and solutions. Both teachers checked on specific students who had perseveration and language issues to provide scaffolding support as needed. For the student with reasoning issues, the teacher with the secondary role spent a few minutes helping him understand the problem situation so that he could develop his own strategy.   - (-3,000) ",63,mtms2012-12-292a,,
"Toward the end of exploration time, both teachers had a two- to three-minute side discussion, called a sidebar. This time was spent discussing what was seen and deciding which students would be called on during the whole-class debriefing, what questions would be asked, who wanted to lead which parts of the discussion, and what notation would be used to support students’ understanding. During this sidebar, the SE decided to do some additional targeted support with the student with perseveration issues to ensure stronger outcomes for him and his group before the class debriefing. During the whole-class debriefing, the GE teacher started the discussion. The SE teacher inserted questions so that students could share their reasoning based on whether they could be successful in front of middle school peers.",64,mtms2012-12-292a,,
"Several students offered the  solutions +(-3,000) and -(+3,000), both of which were correct. Students justified the first solution by claiming, “If you start with $10,000 and add a debt of $3,000, then that will cause your total to go down to $7,000.” Afterward, another student justified the second solution. Charlie, a student with a reasoning disability, then claimed that his answer,  +(-1,000) + (-2,000), should be added to the board. The teacher  asked him to defend his solution,  but since he had difficulty putting his thoughts into language, another student asked Charlie if he wanted her to explain it. Charlie answered affirmatively, and Meagan explained his solution, periodically checking with him to see if she was saying things correctly. In this way, the Mathematical Practice found in  Common Core State Standards for Mathematics of explaining one’s thinking was co-created by a regular and special education student.

"In the parallel teaching approach, we typically divided the class into two heterogeneous miniclasses, with each learning the same content but with different strategies to reach certain students. The miniclasses were typically divided into equal numbers of students, and each group consisted of small groups of three students. These groups were determined by a number of factors: Academic abilities, behavioral factors (both desirable and not), strength of social interaction (both on task behaviors and the willingness to help others), processing capability, and instructional needs. Our classes of thirty students would consist of approximately ten heterogeneous small groups. In parallel teaching, we did not redistribute these thirty students into new groups, but divided the ten small ",67,mtms2012-12-292a,,
"The alternative-teaching approach split the class into two groups, one that needed more practice with the current concept and one that needed more advanced work. The practice group was not necessarily students with disabilities but those who struggled with the language behind the concept (e.g., some additional vocabulary review occurred in this group) or students who tended to struggle with the perception of slope, our example topic. Although these issues could be related to a disability, we often found that all students had strengths and struggles. Hence, that is the reason we let students selfassign to groups, with nudging from us if they needed to change.",68,mtms2012-12-292a,,
"Our alternative teaching approach  is discussed in the context of teaching slope to a standard eighth-grade class. In our past work with slope, we encouraged students to develop an understanding that the slope is a rate that measures the multiplicative that measures the multiplicative relationship between the vertical relationship between the vertical  groups into two miniclasses of fi ve small groups apiece. Each teacher’s miniclass contained a heterogeneous mixture of students.",69,mtms2012-12-292a,,
"In general, we chose the parallel  teaching approach for additional practice when students have already had the opportunity to create a strategy for solving a series of problems. We have found that there are fewer opportunities in a large class to share one’s strategy in whole-class discussion. A smaller miniclass allowed students who have not had a chance to share their thinking to demonstrate their ideas. Fewer students in general means more individualized attention from the teacher, which is the ultimate goal of this co-teaching process.",70,mtms2012-12-292a,,
"The seventh-grade Common Core Math Standard for this lesson involved students using simple reasoning about multiplication and division to solve ratio and rate problems. This standard presents a potential problem for a particular student with perseveration issues. Therefore, we decided that his group (which would also contain the student who needed more visual representations) would explore separately the two processes involving the context of ratio. Both teachers’ classes were meeting the same standards, but the approach was differentiated slightly because of the students’ needs. Before the class period, the GE and SE co-imaged the lesson as described in the previous section.",71,mtms2012-12-292a,,

How many small pizzas would it take to feed 30 people if 2 pizzas could feed 3 people?,73,mtms2012-12-292a,,
"Then we divided the students into two smaller groups (one group was given pizza circles, and the other used a more language-based problem). Each  miniclass then spent time exploring the problem. Before the teachers began the whole-class discussion, they used two to three minutes for sidebar planning to discuss the different strategies or any areas of struggles. The SE reminded the GE to continue to clarify the transition between multiplication and division by circling and repeating signs for the student with perseveration issues.",74,mtms2012-12-292a,,
"As the teachers debriefed, they discussed which students would present ﬁ rst and what questions they might ask the class. Then, each teacher held a whole-class discussion within each miniclass.
