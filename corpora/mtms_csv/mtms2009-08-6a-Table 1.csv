This “Solve It” task appeared in the December 2007/January 2008 issue: ,4,mtms2009-08-6a,,
"This department shares creative solutions to the problems in “Solve It!” Classroom teachers can send their students’ work, along with sufficient information to follow their students’ thinking, to edward s. Mooney, Illinois State University, Campus Box 4520, Normal, IL 61790-4520, or by e-mail to mooney@ilstu.edu. Published solutions will be credited.  article illustrates the various ways that students were able to cook up a solution to the Cookie Store problem. Allison used a guess-and-check  tThe student work included in this  method (see fig. 1) to find the amount of time needed to produce 500 cookies. She started with one time as a baseline, then determined the number of cookies that each bear could decorate or eat during that time. She then found the total number of cookies by summing Mama Bear’s cookies and Baby Bear’s cookies minus the number that Papa Bear ate. ",5,mtms2009-08-6a,,
"Most students sought an overall rate of cookie production. A typical solution method resembled Timothy’s; he found the least common multiple of 7, 12, and 9—the number of minutes that each bear decorated or ate. He then combined the rates to find that the bears produce 29 cookies every 252 minutes. This rate was used to find the number of cookies produced in 500 minutes (see fig. 2).",6,mtms2009-08-6a,,
"Other rates were also used to find the solution. Emily found the number of cookies produced every 63 minutes to be 7.5 (see fig. 3). Emmitt, a student of Karen Yannacio, found the number of cookies produced every 12 minutes to be 1.38095. Olivia found the number of cookies produced every hour by each family member and wrote an expression that she set equal to 500 cookies (see fig. 4, at the bottom on p. 8). Matthew found the number of cookies produced every minute by calculating and then dividing 500 by the result. Caitlyn found how many minutes it would take to produce one cookie, as shown in figure 5.

"example, Abbey set up an equation letting x represent the time needed to make 500 cookies. She multiplied each rate by the time, x, and then combined the results to equal 500 cookies. ",18,mtms2009-08-6a,,
It is gratifying to see students find so many different ways to sift through strategies and solve the task. ,19,mtms2009-08-6a,,
