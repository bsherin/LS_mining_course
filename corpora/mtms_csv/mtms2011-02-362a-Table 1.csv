A dynamic geometry environment coupled with the powerful capabilities of a spreadsheet can greatly enhance student learning.

"Many technologies allow students to create and study dynamic geometric constructions by changing a part of the construction. The effects of that change in other parts of the same construction become clear for students to see. For instance, students can use a graphing calculator such as TI-Nspire with dynamic geometry features to grab and drag the radius of a circle to make it longer or shorter. However, in GeoGebra or Sketchpad, students would need to drag the endpoint of a radius. ",5,mtms2011-02-362a,,
"Students can also use the technology to quickly measure many circles, display these measurements, and observe the effect that changing the radius has on the circumference. These tools can also capture an approximation of the areas of the circles.",6,mtms2011-02-362a,,
"the actiVitY We presented the following lesson in three 50-minute classes of eighth-grade mathematics. Algebra was used in these classes, because the state’s Grade Level Content Expectations call for a signifi cant amount of algebra, including some work with quadratic functions. The students routinely work with a class set of TI-84 graphing calculators. Although they had previously studied area and circumference of the circle, they had not focused very much on pi (p) and had not yet studied quadratic functions. ",7,mtms2011-02-362a,,
"On the fi rst day of the lesson, the authors provided a class set of TI-Nspire calculators that students used to complete the activity (see the accompanying TI-Nspire instructions and the activity sheets online at www.nctm.org/mtms).

Many were able to follow the calculator instructions easily. Once students manipulated the circle to change its radius, measurements of the radius, circumference, and area were collected automatically by the TI-Nspire calculator and stored to a spreadsheet. GeoGebra will do the same (see fig. 1a). However, if students are using Sketchpad, they would need to double click the table after changing the radius each time or set it up to allow the data to be collected every second (see fig. 1b).

Then they analyzed the effects of a change in radius on the circumference and the area. As common sense would suggest, almost all students observed that when the radius increases or decreases, the area and the circumference increase or ",19,mtms2011-02-362a,,

This applet can collect data, store the data in tables, calculate certain ratios, and graph discrete data points. However, students would not be able to add their own attempts at best-fit lines to the discrete graphs or investigate the ratio of A to pi. Teachers would need to pose questions to highlight the more salient points in the investigation.",21,mtms2011-02-362a,,

"Generate a Graph to Analyze Data  Relating Circumference and Radius Students graphed the data they had collected, plotting circumference against radius, using the TI-Nspire. After plotting the collected data, students were asked to use the calculator to graph different linear functions to capture the relationship between the circumference and the radius. Teachers with access to GeoGebra or Sketchpad can do the same. The difference with the TINspire technology is that students could manipulate the line when fitting the data by sliding or turning its graph (see figs. 2a−c). During this process, they could also observe the effects of their movements on the algebraic form. ",23,mtms2011-02-362a,,
"Connect Pi to the Line of Best Fit Students can reflect on the slope of the line they have fitted to the data points. To help students connect the slope with pi, we asked them to create a new spreadsheet column for the ratio of C to r (see fig. 3; at this point, only TI-Nspire screen shots will be used, but similar actions could be taken with other software). Students were then asked:  •  What is the relationship between the ratio C/r and the slope of the line? •  What is the value of the slope? •  What do you get if you divide this  value by 2?  •  Why does it make sense to divide  by 2?",24,mtms2011-02-362a,,

"If students have not previously encountered pi (p), this is a good place to introduce it as the ratio of the circumference to the diameter of a circle, or p = C/d. Manipulating formulas is also a good way to introduce solving equations in which the coeffi cients have been generalized, as highlighted in the Algebra Standard. For example: ratio would be constant, they were ready to investigate what the nature of the relationship might be. Since pi had been a factor in the formula they had just deduced for C, the notion of dividing A by pi made sense.",32,mtms2011-02-362a,,
"Creating a spreadsheet column for A/p and comparing those entries with r allowed students to see that r2 appears to be close to the value of A/p (see fi g. 5). After some computational checking, students connected this work with the familiar formula A = pr2.",33,mtms2011-02-362a,,
"Once the formulas for C and A  were in place, we challenged our students to determine what the effect on the circumference and area would be if a given radius were doubled.

"Most students saw that the circumference doubled and that the area did not double. This helped them understand that the circumference and area change at different rates. Some students were also able to see that the area is multiplied by 4 when the radius doubles.

But many were surprised to see that doubling the radius results in quadrupling the area.  d C=d C= ( )d( )d ( )d( )d table 1 “Mary’s” data solidifi ed students’ understanding of the relationships that exist among radius, circumference, and area.",36,mtms2011-02-362a,,

Use Algebra to Express Relationships among Measures,42,mtms2011-02-362a,,
"To establish that the circumference will always double and the area will always quadruple when the radius is doubled, we introduced a connection to a theme in the Algebra Standard (NCTM 2000): Using mathematical models to study relationships. In this case, students used an algebraic model to understand a geometric concept. We referred students to the two formulas they had generated in the activity and asked:  •  What would the circumference and area be if the radius were doubled? •  How would you represent a radius  of r doubled?",43,mtms2011-02-362a,,
"These questions initiated a discussion of whether the doubled radius ought to be 2r or r2. To help them resolve this question, we asked, “What does it mean to double a number?” ",44,mtms2011-02-362a,,
"Once we had negotiated 2r as a  representation of the doubled radius, we asked students to substitute 2r for r in the formulas for the circumference and area (see fig. 6). As suggested in the Algebra Standard, these sorts of activities help students not  only use their skills to manipulate algebraic terms but also reflect on the relationship between dependent and independent variables. In a wholeclass discussion, students worked through the details of the algebra.",45,mtms2011-02-362a,,
"Finally, we asked students to compare these results to their earlier work with the table to ensure that they were seeing the same ratios in both cases. The last part of this activity can be extended by asking students what they think will happen to the circumference and area of a circle if the radius is tripled or multiplied by some other constant factor.  conclUding thoUghts To connect geometry and algebra, algebra can be used as a tool to generalize results of geometric properties. This article explored how algebra was used in two ways: (1) when writing general formulas for the circumference and area of a circle, and (2) when generalizing a result that appeared in a number of specific instances. ",46,mtms2011-02-362a,,
One of the most important things  that students can learn from their study of algebra is this power to generalize results. We think that these two different ways of generalizing  emphasize two themes of NCTM’s Algebra Standard: (1) modeling and representing and (2) analyzing situations with symbols. ,47,mtms2011-02-362a,,
"This activity also accomplished two other themes. Students studied not only patterns but also change within a context. In light of the Geometry Standard, we believe that this activity helped students analyze the characteristics and properties of a two-dimensional shape, the circle, and reflect on geometric as well as algebraic relationships. Finally, it also linked to the Connections Standard in that it allowed students to “understand how mathematical ideas interconnect and build on one another to produce a coherent whole” (p. 64).
