2,Strengthening Partnerships through Family Math Nights,"Lynn Liao Hodge and Michael Lawson cCollaboration is central to impacting  mathematics teaching and learning. As a university mathematics education professor (the first author) and a graduate student in mathematics education and former high school mathematics teacher (the second author), we have initiated partnerships with urban and rural middle schools, families, and preservice teachers during the past five years, using Family Math Nights (FMNs) as the vehicle for collaboration. FMNs are events that usually take place in school gyms, libraries, or cafeterias to promote awareness and inspire interest in K–12 mathematics education. The events are highly interactive, with stations that allow both adults and students to interact with teachers to better understand what inquiry and best practices in mathematics look like. The approach that we facilitated is quite different from the typical approach to designing and implementing FMNs. ",2,Strengthening Partnerships through Family Math Nights

It is primarily a school-based event, organized by the staff and faculty. However, we have found that FMNs are useful in promoting collaboration across schools, the university, and the local community by bringing together a diverse group of individuals to design and implement the event itself. The overarching goal of our work is to have these initial conversations about the FMN event build toward increased collaboration among stakeholders. The FMNs we have initiated included centers and tasks that allowed  for interaction among parents, classroom teachers, K–12 students, preservice mathematics teachers, graduate students, and university faculty. (See fig. 1 for examples of tasks shown during an FMN.) ",10,Strengthening Partnerships through Family Math Nights
11,Strengthening Partnerships through Family Math Nights,"In this article, we focus on our work with FMNs as an effective resource in developing productive partnerships across schools, families, and the university. We pay special attention to the design features and resources that we have found helpful, while describing the role of FMNs in building strong partnerships that inform mathematics education.

12,Strengthening Partnerships through Family Math Nights,BACKGROUND ON FAMILY MATH NIGHTS,12,Strengthening Partnerships through Family Math Nights
13,Strengthening Partnerships through Family Math Nights,"Parental involvement has long been identified as an important aspect of students’ academic success (HooverDempsey and Sandler 1995; Sheldon and Epstein 2005). Reflecting the important role of parents in student learning, NCTM (2001) has called for schools and parents to partner in support of students’ mathematics education. With this emphasis, educators face well-documented challenges to engaging parents in mathematical learning. Potential challenges include a sense of intimidation on the parents’ part because of previous school experiences (DePlanty, Coulter-Kern, and Duchane 2007) or mathematics experiences (Civil 2014; de Abreu and Cline 2005). Parents also may not have a clear understanding of what appropriate involvement looks like at the middle or high school levels (Walker et al. 2004; Halsey 2005; Van Voorhis 2011). These challenges are further compounded by parents’ schedule  constraints and time availability  (Wanat, Ehly, and Atkinson 2001).",13,Strengthening Partnerships through Family Math Nights
14,Strengthening Partnerships through Family Math Nights,"In response to these challenges, ",14,Strengthening Partnerships through Family Math Nights
15,Strengthening Partnerships through Family Math Nights,"Family Math Nights have been described as nonthreatening spaces where parents and students have opportunities to demystify mathematics while sharing in new challenges (Schussheim 2004). In addition, FMNs provide opportunities to address curriculum needs and issues (e.g., Common Core State Standards), make school resources available, or celebrate mathematics (Szemcsak and West 1996). Two related goals of FMNs are to create a space for parents to become role models as mathematical thinkers (Guevara and Quintos 2003) and to develop strategies that foster positive attitudes about mathematics (Ford, Follmer, and Litz 1998). This learning on the parents’ part has the potential to be extended to their interactions with their own students  at home and in other informal spaces.",15,Strengthening Partnerships through Family Math Nights
16,Strengthening Partnerships through Family Math Nights,"Our work has been informed by  the overlapping spheres of influence model developed by Epstein (2001) (see fig. 2). This model offers a way to think about building partnerships in support of students’ mathematics education. For our purposes, we take away two important points from Epstein’s model and adapt the model to showcase the university, school, and family partnerships existing within a partnership with the community at large. First, the school, home, university, and community are stakeholders in students’ success in school (and, specifically, mathematics), and they share mutual interests, influences,  and experiences. ",16,Strengthening Partnerships through Family Math Nights
17,Strengthening Partnerships through Family Math Nights,"Second, these interests, influences, and experiences can be expanded with concerted effort by one or more of these stakeholders to participate in activities that foster discussion and understanding of different perspectives. Earlier work in parental involvement viewed the school, home, and community as separate entities, rather than overlapping circles, emphasizing the disconnects rather than the commonalities that can be leveraged. We now explore the overlaps across stakeholders in our work with FMNs by noting the critical practices and moments that contribute to enhanced collaboration.",17,Strengthening Partnerships through Family Math Nights

26,Strengthening Partnerships through Family Math Nights,"FIVE CRITICAL PRACTICES: BUILDING COLLABORATION 1. Create a comfortable and  inviting space. We choose to host the event in nonclassroom spaces, such as the library or cafeteria, and to provide dinner and snacks. We also model friendly and engaging manners by introducing ourselves and talking with visitors.",26,Strengthening Partnerships through Family Math Nights
27,Strengthening Partnerships through Family Math Nights,"2. Provide choices for participation. Work stations create many possibilities for students and parents and other significant adults to participate in the FMN. We generally offer five different kinds of stations: open tasks, puzzles, games, favorite STEM books, and information about the mathematics standards.",27,Strengthening Partnerships through Family Math Nights

Work station activities include manipulatives, graphic organizers, pictures, and concrete materials as much as possible to make the ideas comes to life.  4. Promote conversations about mathematics. Facilitators are encouraged to ask questions, raise points to consider, and encourage interaction at the work stations.  5. Involve representation from all stakeholders as part of the design and implementation process. We have found it productive to include representation from across stakeholders as part of the FMN efforts. ",28,Strengthening Partnerships through Family Math Nights
29,Strengthening Partnerships through Family Math Nights,"We focus on practice 5 in unpacking the key moments of the design and implementation process that provide opportunities for building collaboration.

30,Strengthening Partnerships through Family Math Nights,ZOOMING IN ON PRACTICE 5,30,Strengthening Partnerships through Family Math Nights
31,Strengthening Partnerships through Family Math Nights,"Key Moments for Collaboration 1.  The initial meeting. We have found it useful to visit the school several weeks before the event to understand the context and meet with lead teachers, administrators, and parent volunteers. The purpose of the meeting is to discuss the focus of the event and to develop goals that are specific to the school and its community. For example, one middle school sought to raise awareness about mathematics and literacy, so the focus for the event was “family math and literacy.”  2.  Visiting a university course. A team  of lead teachers and parents are invited to visit a university mathematics education course to talk with preservice teachers about the strengths and challenges of supporting students in mathematics. The course instructor facilitates a discussion about the norms and the concrete activities that can potentially be part of the FMN. Prior to this, preservice teachers in the  course have been assigned readings about engaging parents in mathematics and FMNs in particular. Preservice teachers draw on this meeting and existing resources to engage in the design process with input from the instructor and school faculty. Preservice teachers then work in pairs at one work  station during the FMN.  3. Online check-in. The universitybased stakeholders and the lead teacher create a Google shared file for all stakeholders to post activities for the work stations and any other information as the process of design continues. In addition, check-ins by email or another online format allows discussions as we move closer to the date.",31,Strengthening Partnerships through Family Math Nights
32,Strengthening Partnerships through Family Math Nights,"4. Setup. All stakeholders participate in the setup if possible. This is another opportunity for further collaboration. At least two individuals are in charge of each work station, and they can be parents, students, school faculty, university faculty, and preservice teachers. ",32,Strengthening Partnerships through Family Math Nights
33,Strengthening Partnerships through Family Math Nights,PARTICIPANTS’ THOUGHTS,33,Strengthening Partnerships through Family Math Nights
34,Strengthening Partnerships through Family Math Nights,"Throughout our work with FMNs, we have collected survey data and open-ended responses from participants about their views of the FMN. We found that parents’ and students’ comments about the FMN were overwhelmingly favorable. Parents’ comments focused on mathematics as a subject that is useful and approachable. Further, parents reported that they did not realize that mathematics included much more than problems found in textbooks, and they were reminded of “how much we use math every day!” Most of the students spoke about their changing attitudes toward mathematics as they left the FMN, now seeing mathematics as something fun and enjoyable. As  one student put it, “I enjoyed it more than I expected.” Students also spoke about seeing math concepts outside of the math classroom. ",34,Strengthening Partnerships through Family Math Nights
35,Strengthening Partnerships through Family Math Nights,The preservice teachers shared comments in their reflections about FMN. The following comments from two university students are representative:,35,Strengthening Partnerships through Family Math Nights
36,Strengthening Partnerships through Family Math Nights,"What an excellent way to involve students, parents, teachers, and all of us. This actually gave me the opportunity to work with students and parents in a fun environment that involved math. Overall, this is an excellent way to encourage parental involvement and for teachers to really get to know their students, their parents, and the community.",36,Strengthening Partnerships through Family Math Nights
37,Strengthening Partnerships through Family Math Nights,"I had never heard of anything like “family math night” before this class. Now, I would definitely support a community event like this. I was blown away by the turnout and the fun atmosphere. I would love an opportunity like this for my students. During the Family Math Night, I had a chance to work with groups of students on a logic puzzle game that required them to develop a strategy. It was a good way for me to understand students’ questions and also what they enjoyed about math.",37,Strengthening Partnerships through Family Math Nights
38,Strengthening Partnerships through Family Math Nights,FOSTERING COLLABORATION WITH FMNS,38,Strengthening Partnerships through Family Math Nights
39,Strengthening Partnerships through Family Math Nights,"We see FMNs as an effective way to build and strengthen partnerships among the school, the community, and the university in support of students’ mathematical learning and motivation. We have seen families react positively and participate enthusiastically in the activities at FMNs and students more invested in mathematics later in the classroom. Further, we have seen our partnerships with schools and the community, initiated by FMNs, extend into other projects in these settings. For example, a classroom teacher,   university students, and faculty worked together on a communitybased math project that examined local issues (e.g., crime in our neighborhood, healthy eating) in middle school classrooms. FMNs proved to be an important vehicle in the process of fostering positive collaboration among families, schools, and the university. ",39,Strengthening Partnerships through Family Math Nights
