Maximum Chocolate Party game; teachers can easily create others. This game has been used repeatedly in professional development seminars for middle school teachers.

"There are three tables at the Maximum Chocolate Party (MCP). One, two, and three chocolate bars, identical in size and flavor, are on the first, second, and third tables, respectively. Each  guest, on arrival, chooses a table and sits down. The rules of the MCP state that when all guests are seated, the chocolate from each table is divided equally among those at the table. For the purpose of this game, we assume that all players want to maximize their share of chocolate and that every guest chooses as if he or she were to be the last. ",7,mtms2013-04-484a,,
"Almost everyone loves chocolate. However, the same cannot be said about fractions, which are loved by markedly fewer. Middle school students tend to view them with wary respect, but little affection. We attempt to sweeten the subject by describing a type of game involving division of chocolate bars. The activity we describe provides a context for ordering and manipulating fractions. The use of a number line as tool for understanding fractions will be discussed. This activity not only encourages students to think deeper about fractions but also highlights students’ ability to generalize and reason—crucial skills in learning mathematics. It may serve to lead students into higherorder tasks involving the formulation ",8,mtms2013-04-484a,,

This may be a good place to pause and have students convince themselves that in the case of a three-way tie, the next three guests will choose tables one, two, and three in some order. Regardless of their choices, the next guest in line will face exactly the same situation. For example, in table 1 the fourth, fifth, and sixth guests happened to choose tables one, three, and two.

We can think about every one of these three fractions as “one unit fraction less than the whole.” However, the units are different: 1/2 is 1/2 less than  1/2 1/2 the whole, 2/3 is 1/3 less than the whole, and 3/4 is 1/4 less than the whole.

Informally stated: “It is wonderful to have a lot of friends, but not when you are sharing chocolate.” After hearing this, students laugh, but then everybody confi dently agrees that 1/2 > 1/3 > 1/4. Mathematically, it can be stated as follows: Unit fractions can be compared by comparing denominators—the greater the denominator, the smaller the value of the unit fraction.",26,mtms2013-04-484a,,
"Imagine three unwrapped identical chocolate bars. One is missing 1/2, one is missing 1/3, and one is missing 1/4. In which bar does more chocolate remain? The answer is the same as the answer to “where less is missing.” When the second question is answered, students can conclude that 1/2 < 2/3 < 3/4.

Guest 13,33,mtms2013-04-484a,,
"Which table should be chosen by the thirteenth guest? Let’s start by comparing 1/3 and 2/5. Using equivalent fractions, 1/3 = 2/6. However, 2/5 is greater than 2/6. Previously, we have established that, for unit fractions, the greater the denominator, the smaller the value of the fraction. Thus, 1/5 is greater than 1/6. We have two of each such parts. As a result, 2/5 > 2/6. Thus, the rule works not only for unit fractions but also for any fractions with common numerators. (Imagine placing an equal number of weights on both sides of a scale. All the weights on the right side are equal among themselves, and all the weights on the left side are equal among themselves. But every weight on the left is lighter than every weight on the right. Which combined quantity is lighter?) ",34,mtms2013-04-484a,,
"Now we need to compare 2/5 and 3/7. They are both less than 1/2. An illustration shown in ﬁ gure 2 is similar to ﬁ gure 1 and can demonstrate  that 2/5 is less than 1/2 by half of 1/5 and that 3/7 is less than 1/2 by half of 1/7. Because 1/5 is greater than 1/7, 2/5 is farther to the left on the number line from 1/2 than 3/7. This shows that 2/5 < 3/7, and the thirteenth guest should go to the third table.

As was previously stated, 2/5 is less than 1/2 by half of 1/5. In other words, 2/5 is less than 1/2 by 1/10, or  = −= − 10",37,mtms2013-04-484a,,

"The number of bars on a particular table becomes the numerator of all the fractions in the corresponding column because that is the number of bars being evenly divided among a growing number of guests. The number of guests becomes the denominator in those fractions. See table 1. Only one guest joins the first table between the fourth guest (who would get exactly 1 bar at each table) and the tenth guest (who would get an amount equal to 1/2 bar at each table). At the same time, two guests join the second table and three guests join the third table. In fact, to get to the next “same amount” at each table, we need to add the numerator to the denominator. That is,  the total number of the “new” guests will be equal to the total number of chocolates at all three tables.",63,mtms2013-04-484a,,
2. Why “Starting with Guest  Number (n – 2)?”,64,mtms2013-04-484a,,

We have to add numbers that are one fewer than the numbers of bars on each table. In this way, the next guest will have exactly 1 bar available at each table. Mathematically, “the next guest” can be expressed as “+ 1.” Thus, for three tables, the number of the first guest who would have exactly 1 bar can be found as  (a – 1) + (b – 1) + (c – 1) + 1, where  a, b, and c are the number of bars on the first, second, and third tables, respectively.

After that, every fifth guest will be faced with the same amount of chocolate at each table. This leads to a generalization of our hypothesis:   Assuming that there are t tables with the total of n chocolates on them (each table has at least 1 chocolate bar and there is no  common factor greater than  1 for all the numbers of chocolates on the tables), every nth guest starting with guest number  (n – (t – 1) = n – t + 1) is faced with an equal amount of chocolate at each table.",71,mtms2013-04-484a,,
