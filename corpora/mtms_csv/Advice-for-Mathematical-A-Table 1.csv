7,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation,"With new standards come new teaching opportunities. The Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSM) emphasizes argumentation as one of its eight mathematical practices across grades and across mathematical topics. Social and mathematical aspects of argumentation are included in the statement that students should “Construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others” (CCSSI 2010, p. 6).",7,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation
8,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation,"Mathematical argumentation is a special kind of discourse, the goal of which is to determine the truth of mathematical statements. Supporting argumentation is complex, and teachers need a variety of methods for doing so. The method we focus on in this article is giving students advice about how to behave as they engage in mathematical argumentation. Although much has been written on questioning to support mathematical discourse, telling is an important teaching move, too (Chazan and Ball 1999; Parks 2010).",8,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation
9,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation,"Mathematical argumentation can be viewed as a social activity with three parts, in which students work together to (1) make conjectures, (2) justify the conjectures, and (3) decide whether they are true or false (i.e., conclude) (Erduran, Simon, and Osborne 2004; Sowder and Harel 1998; Zohar and Nemet 2002). Conjecturing is a process of conscious guessing (Lakatos 1976) or pattern finding to create mathematical statements of as-yet undetermined mathematical validity (Harel 2008). Justifying is a process of explicating one’s reasoning to establish the mathematical validity of a conjecture. Concluding is the process of coming to consensus or agreement about the validity of the conjecture and its justification (Shechtman and Knudsen 2009).",9,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation
10,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation,"Productively engaging students in mathematical argumentation is  fig. 1 A poster of the three stages of argumentation, containing plenty of space for writing, was an integral part of classroom discussions.",10,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation
11,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation,"one of many challenges in the era of CCSSM. We report on successful episodes of argumentation conducted by teachers and students participating in the Bridging Professional Development project as well as several teacher moves that could help engage students’ argumentation. Teachers Abby, Bernie, Debbie, and Stephanie (pseudonyms) were all middle school teachers whose work is portrayed in a series of vignettes, in which they both tell and show students how to argue. ",11,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation
12,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation,Material supports for arguMentation,12,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation
13,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation,"In the Bridging project, teachers participated in professional development and received classroom materials that included activity sheets, software, and posters. Teachers used one of two sets of activities. In Patterns of Coordinates, students draw four rectangles on a coordinate grid, label the coordinates of the vertices, look for patterns in the coordinates of these rectangles, make conjectures based on those  patterns, and then justify the conjectures. In Triangles: Sides and Angles, students produce a collection of mathematical truths (theorems) that they use to argue that the sum of the measures in a triangle is 180 degrees. Teachers were given three unique  posters containing— 1.  general social rules for productive discussions (based on Chapin, O’Connor, and Anderson 2009); 2.  the stages conjecturing, justifying,  and concluding, with plenty of white space in which to write (see fig. 1); and  3.  a list of mathematical or socio- mathematical behaviors for each of the three stages (see fig. 2). ",13,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation
14,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation,"This last poster lists advice about  how to behave at two levels. Both individual and collective argumentation—interactions in which two or more people establish whether a conjecture is true or false (Yackel 2002)— are supported. We have organized the vignettes by the categories on the posters: conjecturing, justifying, and concluding.  how teachers support arguMentation",14,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation
15,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation,Conjecturing,15,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation
16,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation,"In the conjecturing phase of argumentation, Bridging teachers either lead a whole-class session or ask students to formulate conjectures individually or in small groups and then bring the whole class together to clarify and share the findings. Conjectures are often based on an examination of patterns: a collection of suggestive cases, a sequence, or the changes in measures while “sweeping through” a set of figures in a dynamic geometry program.",16,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation
17,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation,"Conjectures are made not only  on what is known but also by going beyond what is known. The advice, be creative, is shorthand for giving students permission to say something  new. Mathematics is, by nature, a creative endeavor, as mathematicians uncover new truths with arguments that have yet to be made (de Holton et al. 2001). ",17,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation
18,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation,"How do teachers foster such cre- ativity? They do so, in part, by telling students what is expected of them, by making “creativity” accessible and concrete. Abby, using activities from the Triangles unit, found that students were reluctant to make conjectures that went beyond what they already knew. To foster creative conjecturing, Abby gave a minilecture, weaving in advice related to the How to Do Argumentation poster, which remained displayed in her classroom for the duration of the activities:   Conjectures don’t have to be hugely deep and powerful, but they have to be something that is beyond what we’ve already established. You can say something that, once you think about it, you can change your mind. But still write it down as an immediate conjecture because it might be worthwhile to talk through the justification. I really want to push you guys today. You tend to get a little bit like, “I wrote a conjecture, I’m done.” The point of today is to push you to make as many conjectures as you can. I’d like to ask everyone to list—",18,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation
19,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation,I’m going to pass out extra paper—at least four conjectures per table; that means at least one per person and one as a group. ,19,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation
20,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation,"Abby gave students details about  what it means to “be creative” in making conjectures: go beyond, write down conjectures without judging, and generate many conjectures. She provided extra paper as a concrete representation of her instructions to “make as many conjectures as you can.”",20,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation
21,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation,"Abby then explained that the class was going to spend fifteen or twenty minutes exploring. Students were to— fig. 2 the rules for argumentation reminded students of the framework within which they were to work.   play, observe, wonder, explore. Really think about these conjectures as you’re playing, and your observations, and your wonderings, and then really explore them, so we can move on from there.",21,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation
22,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation,"With these directions, Abby provided students with examples of behaviors indicative of creativity—play, observe, wonder, and explore. She encouraged and celebrated such behaviors. Although telling was not the only move Abby made to support students in making more and better conjectures,  there is evidence that this minilecture helped. In the small-group work time that followed, students formulated their required four conjectures per group; some groups produced even more.",22,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation
23,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation,Justifying,23,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation
24,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation,Justification occurs in at least three ways in Bridging teachers’ classrooms: 1. Teams or individuals generate  conjectures and the whole class justifies them.  2. The whole class together generates  and justifies conjectures. ,24,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation

26,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation,"3. Teams or individuals come up   with conjectures and justifications, which are shared with the class  and brought to conclusion. ",26,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation
27,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation,Teachers often use the poster in  figure 1 to capture arguments presented to or constructed by the class. ,27,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation
28,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation,"Justifying, at the most basic level, requires students to look for reasons why a conjecture is true or false. The poster makes this explicit for those just beginning to learn the arguing process. ",28,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation
29,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation,"In explaining how to justify, ",29,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation
30,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation,"Bernie presented students with three ways to justify: (1) numerically, (2) visually, and (3) geometrically. The words numeric, visual, and geometric  were written on the white board every day, and Bernie repeated these justifications before engaging in the whole-class sharing of them. Moreover, after some justifications, she also highlighted particular student moves:   What Sandy and Nancy [pseudonyms] just did is a geometric justification. They didn’t use any numbers; they didn’t say anything about it being visual or what it looked like. They used geometry; they used what they knew about the radius of a circle. So we’ll say that one’s true. ",30,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation
31,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation,"Giving justification advice, such  as “Look for examples and counterexamples,” can be used at an individual, small-group, or whole-class level.  It gives students a place to start. ",31,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation
32,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation,"Looking for examples can lead students to consider whether a conjecture applies to all cases. In Abby’s class, she clarified the use of examples, or cases, with this prompt to help her students make better arguments:  As a group, you need to argue through the conjectures. You need to think about different cases: Is it true in all cases? I really want you to think about using terminology in your justification of linear pairs, exterior angles, congruency; use the math language that we’ve been building. Everyone here, by the end of class today, should have some kind of argument written down.",32,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation
33,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation,"Abby also stated the expectation  that students would make written arguments, a way to ensure that students who participate in collective argumentation are also held accountable at the individual level. Students’ workbooks showed evidence that they made this transition to written, individual argumentation.",33,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation
34,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation,"Debbie, another teacher, used  the Triangles materials to clarify  the purpose of both examples and counterexamples in justifications. ",34,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation
35,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation,"Debbie: OK, so Jason, do we have  some justification either that this statement [An exterior angle is always obtuse] is true or that this statement is false? If so, what is our supporting argument? [She points  to “Use examples and counterexamples” on the poster.] We’re looking for examples to either support this or a counterexample to show that this is false. Adam? ",35,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation
36,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation,"Adam: Well, justification as false is  that we tried it on a real-life angle. We tried to measure an angle, and it was 33.6 degrees.",36,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation
37,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation,Debbie: OK. [Writing in the justification  space on the second poster: “This is false. We are able to make an exterior angle with measure 33.6°.”],37,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation
38,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation,"This excerpt shows how Debbie’s students, designated special education and/or English language learners, were able to use counterexamples. They also received guidance from their teacher, including a description of a counterexample. Debbie then further clarified and labeled the use of counterexample for the class by saying, “This example where we found an exterior angle that had a measure that was acute and less than its adjacent interior angle—this is what we call a counterexample.” She then explained that “it shows that our conjecture is false.” ",38,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation
39,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation,Her words elaborated on the  poster’s advice and summarized students’ discussion by explaining what a counterexample is and how it is used. Evidence of her effectiveness is found in the gains that students made on a pretest and posttest of content of the Triangles unit (comparable to the gains of middle- and high-achieving students in other classes). ,39,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation
40,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation,"Building off other people’s ideas is the basis for the social process of argumentation. It is possible to have a lot of individual justifications, given one after the other, and label that as a classroom discussion, but then students would be missing out on the opportunity to understand the mathematical ideas of others. ",40,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation
41,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation,"Stephanie, using the Patterns of ",41,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation
42,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation,"Coordinates activities, helped students build off others’ ideas. In the midst of  an activity using rectangles, she realized that students needed a better definition of rectangles. Making good definitions is a special kind of argumentation. In this situation, the proposed definition is a conjecture. The justification entails whether the definition includes all cases of the mathematical concept being defined and excludes all cases that are nonexamples. Stephanie explained to students:  We’re going to establish the definition of a rectangle. Please make sure you’re paying attention to each other’s comments. Remember, I want you to speak even if what you want to say is a question. I want to see you participating, so that you can get credit for math argumentation. ",42,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation
43,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation,"One student, Ethan, stated that a rectangle is a four-sided figure with two sets of different sides with four right angles. Darian, another student, defined a rectangle as a figure with two sets of parallel and two sets of vertical sides. Ethan and Darian each gave a definition of a rectangle, but Darien’s thoughts seemed independent of Ethan’s. Stephanie further explained how to “build off each other’s ideas”: During math argumentation, students should respond to each other’s comments, rather than simply make individual statements. Most students need reminders of and encouragement about correct behavior when making arguments—or in this case, definitions—as a whole class. The class continued, as Olivia walked to the board and noted—  A square is not a rectangle. Square is going be like that [draws a square] and rectangle isn’t, like that, and they don’t have to be equal [draws a rectangle, vertically elongated]. ",43,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation
44,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation,Olivia’s comment is related to ,44,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation
45,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation,"Ethan’s and Darian’s but she did not  make an explicit connection. She offered the conjecture that a square is not a rectangle, rather than a definition of a rectangle. Another student, Matthew, agreed with Ethan’s statement and expressed that a rectangle can be a square but a square cannot be a rectangle. ",45,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation
46,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation,"Although Matthew said he was  responding to Ethan, his statement in fact is related to Olivia’s. Stephanie passed the baton to Jacob, who took a more summary approach and addressed all the previous attempts at definition as he walked to the board:  OK. I disagree with what Matthew, Darien, Kel, and Ethan said because uh—a rectangle is a quadrilateral with all straight—OK. A closed figure with all straight lines with four 90 degree angles and two sets of parallel sides.",46,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation
47,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation,"Jacob did a better job of connecting his definition of a rectangle to what other students had said. The class built on this definition to conclude that a square is a rectangle, but that not all rectangles are squares. Students did not immediately  follow Stephanie’s directive to build off each other’s statements. Instead, a gradual shift was made toward relating new ideas to what students had already said. Stephanie told students what was expected of them and managed their turn taking. Students’ contributions were mathematically meaningful and lengthy enough to portray complex ideas. Stephanie’s moves demonstrate that setting clear expectations through telling students how they should behave during argumentation gradually pays off.",47,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation
48,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation,"In argumentation, students try  to convince others of their opinions. However, teachers need to keep in mind that students could be wrong, which is acceptable. This norm can be difficult to support. Teachers can  remind students that conjectures are not considered true until there is a justification that satisfies everyone. On the other hand, students may want to “disown” conjectures that turn out to be false. ",48,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation
49,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation,"Bernie was working with a pair of  students on the Triangles activities, in front of the whole class. They had posed the conjecture that an exterior angle of a triangle is always larger than the interior. Several pairs of students around the room started making counterexamples using dynamic geometry software. But Bernie let the students who made the conjecture justify that it was false. She told them that even if they find their conjecture to be false, it is still a justification and provides a counterexample. ",49,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation
50,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation,Students can feel uncomfortable  being associated with false statements. Making a conjecture that is judged as false or wrong may go against the grain of what they have learned about being in mathematics class. Bernie worked to overcome this feeling by praising the conjecture that turned out to be false for its role in developing argumentation. ,50,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation
51,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation,Concluding,51,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation
52,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation,"Concluding is, in essence, a time for class agreement that a conjecture is true or false, assuming that an argument has been persuasive and correct. Bernie ended each class period with concluding. With the class, she examined each argument that had been made for a conjecture and “stamped” them as true or false. She prompted students to add the true statements to their notebook.",52,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation
53,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation,Bernie asked if everyone agreed. ,53,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation
54,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation,"In cases where they did not, she continued the argument until all were convinced. She had them add this proven conjecture, a fact, to a list they had made in their workbooks. Both stamping and adding to a list are concrete aspects of concluding.",54,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation

56,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation,"All four teachers in the vignettes above succeeded in supporting argumentation by students over several class periods—far more than we can share in this article. These teachers were explicit about what was expected of students and what made for good argumentation. As a community of mathematics educators, we know that telling is not all there is to teaching, but these examples show us that telling has its place in setting expectations for what constitutes mathematical argumentation. Additionally, what we tell students matters: Advice to help make argumentation more accessible by indicating specific behaviors and norms can make a difference in the amount and quality of students’ participation in argumentation.",56,Advice for Mathematical Argumentation
