0,Web 2.0 in the Mathematics Classroom - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"A key characteristic of successful mathematics teachers is that they are able to provide varied activities that promote student learning and assessment. Web 2.0 applications can provide an assortment of tools to help produce creative activities. The term Web 2.0 designates Internet applications that provide a context in which students create, collaborate, and communicate. The Internet technology is not unique, but the applications that are accessed and used are interactive and go beyond static browsing. A Web 2.0 tool enables the student to enter data and create multimedia products using text, graphics, audio, and video. The possibilities for  creativity and variety are endless.",,
1,Web 2.0 in the Mathematics Classroom - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The Standards for Mathematical Practice (SMP) in the Common Core State Standards include a strong emphasis on student reasoning and sense making and on demonstrations of understanding (CCSSI 2010). In describing mathematical proficiency, these standards recommend that students should work collaboratively, explaining and discussing concepts to refine understanding (CCSSI 2010, SMP 2 and 3, p. 6). Students should model and apply their mathematics knowledge (SMP 4, p. 7) and use technological tools and communicate their understanding precisely (SMP 5 and 6, p. 7). Web 2.0 tools can be useful in structuring a variety of learning experiences to enable the development of students habits of practice, as recommended by the Standards for Mathematical Practice. In the following activities, students interact with the mathematics in a creative and collaborative context and communicate their understanding both individually and in groups while working on projects.",,
2,Web 2.0 in the Mathematics Classroom - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,THE GLOGSTER PROJECT,,
3,Web 2.0 in the Mathematics Classroom - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Glogster is a Web 2.0 tool that is used to create a glog, which is an interactive visual platform in which  users create a poster containing multimedia elements including text, audio, video, images, graphics, drawings, and data (GlogsterEDU). The tool uses a simple drag-and-drop interface that is easily mastered by students of many ages and learning styles. It can be useful in not only a lower-level general math class but also an advanced course. The Glogster (http://edu.glogster.com) free version was used for this project. A commercial version includes additional features.",,
4,Web 2.0 in the Mathematics Classroom - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The Glogster Project was implemented in two algebra classes in a rural southern middle school. Each class included about twenty students who were in eighth and ninth grade. The students worked in groups of three or four to create a multimedia representation of an assigned algebra topic. This project was assigned late in the school year as a way to further examine major topics already studied in the course, including the Pythagorean theorem, the distance and midpoint formula, scatter plots, and the quadratic formula. The purpose of the activity was to engage students in revisiting and modeling their understanding of the concepts and to broaden and deepen their understanding. The group assignment was used to promote a discussion of the concepts.",,
5,Web 2.0 in the Mathematics Classroom - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The students were first oriented to Glogster by viewing examples of glog posters and learning how to use the software. Preparing the glog was a two-step process. Students first determined their content, and then created the design. The assignment stipulated that students create a glog for their topic containing the following content features:",,

9,Web 2.0 in the Mathematics Classroom - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,An example of a real-world problem,,
10,Web 2.0 in the Mathematics Classroom - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Each group planned extensively. Students began by discussing the topic, definition, model, and application. Rich discussion was evident as students debated and constructed a group understanding of the topic. An informal storyboard was used to encourage students to take notes and keep track of their ideas.",,
11,Web 2.0 in the Mathematics Classroom - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Once the ideas were in place, the groups decided on the design features that they would incorporate into their glog. They were asked to include text (words, equations, algebraic expressions), images (pictures, graphs), and audio/video (an original podcast, a link to an online video, a link to their original video uploaded to YouTube). They could select from a wide variety of color schemes and could arrange elements as they chose. Computer lab time was allocated so that the groups could complete the design process. Video cameras and digital audio recorders were available for original media, which was encouraged. Each group completed a glog that was presented to the class at the end of the two-week project. Assessment was based on a rubric.",,
12,Web 2.0 in the Mathematics Classroom - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The glog in figure 1 described the distance formula and the midpoint formula. It included graphs, formulas, video of a problem under construction (from SchoolTube), and two applications: a baseball diamond and finance. Another glog, shown in figure 2, explored scatter plots and included several graphs, definitions, applications, and video calculator instructions.",,

15,Web 2.0 in the Mathematics Classroom - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Research Study,,
16,Web 2.0 in the Mathematics Classroom - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,The research study spotlighted here examined the effect on attitudes  toward mathematics when the Glogster activity was used in a middle school algebra class. Participants in the study were thirty students in two classes. Data were not included for students who failed to return consent forms. The data collection involved both a presurvey and a postsurvey of student attitudes toward mathematics. A focus group discussion with students at the end of the study collected comments about the project activities.,,
17,Web 2.0 in the Mathematics Classroom - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Results from both the pre-attitude and post-attitude measure showed that the students were more positive toward mathematics at the end of the study. The focus group discussion indicated that students enjoyed the activities, liked the active involvement, and found it motivating. One student said, It is better than taking notes because then I get tired and I zone out. With this, you actually want to focus and figure out what you want to do because you have to present it and you want it to be good. And it will reflect on you. Comments indicated that the presentations were a source of motivation for many students.",,
18,Web 2.0 in the Mathematics Classroom - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Students also reported that they enjoyed the multimedia, especially the color and the videos: I like it when we get to do different colors and we got to personalize it and that made it pop out. They said that they appreciated the collaboration because they found it was cool to see everyones view on the math and their applications. The students further revealed that they were quite pleased with their creations. One student said, This makes math real and fun. I understand it better now. An evaluation of their projects confirmed that they were able to accurately model the mathematical concepts, including real-world problems, in varied representations.",,
19,Web 2.0 in the Mathematics Classroom - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"One disappointment was that groups used online video material rather than creating their own videos. The Khan Academy (https://www .khanacademy.org) site was appealing to students, as were other videos available in SchoolTube (http://www .schooltube.com). Although students knew how to create a video or a podcast, this create-your-own video was only an option, and students chose the finished products that were available online. This may have occurred because of their lack of experience, thus making them unwilling to take a chance on original video. In future projects, additional instruction will be given on creating video, and an original video or podcast will be required.",,
20,Web 2.0 in the Mathematics Classroom - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Conclusions from the research component involved attitudes, engagement, and collaboration. From evidence based on survey results and comments, students attitudes toward mathematics showed improvement after the project. Their comments confirmed that they were engaged and interested. They indicated that the group collaboration was important in helping them talk about the content and understand it better. They felt that they learned mathematics, and they enjoyed it, as well. The Glogster tool was effective in providing a context for students to create (model), collaborate (discuss), and communicate their understanding.",,

23,Web 2.0 in the Mathematics Classroom - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Wordle,,
24,Web 2.0 in the Mathematics Classroom - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"An application that generates word clouds or pictures composed of words is the principle behind Wordle (Feinberg; http://www.wordle.net). The relative size of the words is proportional to their frequency in the chosen text. In addition to being fun and colorful, a Wordle is an effective way to assess student understanding and emphasize vocabulary. It can be used for guided reflection and discussion to promote a deeper understanding of the vocabulary. For example, student pairs were asked to generate a ten-word vocabulary list once they had finished a unit on equations. These lists were entered into the Wordle application. Figure 3 shows one resulting graphic. Students were asked to discuss the Wordle in their groups and decide whether they agreed with the vocabulary terms that were identified as most important by the class. This guided reflection resulted in deeper learning of the vocabulary. A similar activity would be appropriate to emphasize the vocabulary in any topic or at any level.",,

28,Web 2.0 in the Mathematics Classroom - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"For a quick and easy way to  collect data from students, use Poll  Everywhere (http://www.poll everywhere.com). This application allows the teacher to set up a survey, and students can respond either by computer or by text message. (Yes, cell phones in the classroom!) The survey questions may be true or false, multiple choice, or open ended. Poll Everywhere will then display the results instantaneously, either as a table, a graph, or as text. The text can be transferred to a Wordle or simply used for discussion. This tool provides formative assessment that is similar to personal response systems, known as clickers, which involve considerable expense and set up. The only requirement for Poll Everywhere is that each student or group has access to a smartphone or computer.",,
29,Web 2.0 in the Mathematics Classroom - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Pixton,,
30,Web 2.0 in the Mathematics Classroom - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"To enable students to create their own comic strips using a simple click-and-drag interface, look up the online tool called Pixton (http://pixton.com). This tool allows students to write their own application problems. Figure 4 shows a simple Pixton example that students constructed in response to being asked to generate an arithmetic or geometric sequence of their own. Students then presented their comic strips to the class the next day, and the class discussed the problems. Problem posing has long been recognized as a motivating instructional practice in mathematics (e.g., Polya 1957), requiring students to reflect on the mathematics and model it in a real-world context. Pixton provides a graphic, electronic interface that broadens this traditional activity using a twenty-first-century learning tool.",,

34,Web 2.0 in the Mathematics Classroom - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"To create podcasts and customize characters that speak, students can access Voki (http://www.voki .com/). They can choose a character,  a background, and a voice or accent or use their own. Students might create a series of vokis to explain a concept or give examples or steps for solving a problem or understanding the context of a problem. In any of these uses, the student or group must reflect and plan how to articulate their understanding through a podcast. A sample voki created by a student group shows a character stating the steps for solving a word problem. The group discussed the problem at length and planned carefully so that all members were in agreement and could justify each step. The final product can be accessed at http://www.voki.com/pickup.php?scid=7151891&height=267&width=200. This activity provided a different communication mediumaudiowhich involved both reflection and discussion as the group had to articulate about and agree on their understanding. The presentation could be given to the class or collected and evaluated by the teacher as formative or summative assessment data.",,
35,Web 2.0 in the Mathematics Classroom - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Trading Card,,
36,Web 2.0 in the Mathematics Classroom - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"To create a product that resembles a baseball card, including graphics and text, students can access the Trading Card application (http://www .bighugelabs.com/deck.php). This online tool could be used, for example, to create a project to study the history of mathematics. Students can select a mathematician and create his or her own card. Another project involved student groups interviewing people in the community and making a card to show how mathematics was used in their work. Figure 5 shows a student-created card for a police officer. In this project to facilitate connections between mathematics and the real world, the cards created by class groups were displayed on a bulletin board titled, When are we ever going to use this?",,

It produces Flash Videos similar to those found at the Khan Academy site and is an iPad application that also works in any computer browser. This tool can be used by the teacher to produce online learning materials. However, it is most valuable when accessed by students. Student groups can be assigned a problem and can write on the electronic whiteboard as they explain what they are doing and why during their presentation via EduCreations. They can also import graphics, such as a grid for constructing a graph. The resulting video can  be presented to the class or it can  be viewed later by the teacher  for assessment.",,

They can assist students in creating, collaborating, and communicating understanding. It is important to remember that although a tool might be good for the teacher, it is almost always better to put it in the hands of the students. The maximum benefit will occur when students  create and communicate a model of their understanding in a hands-on collaborative environment that also engages them mathematically.",,
