8,"Books, Products and Software Reviews (November 2014) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Organized by conceptual topic, each chapter describes how one might present topics through tasks and might assess student learning. The classroom vignettes and examples lead readers through questions for personal reflection.",,
9,"Books, Products and Software Reviews (November 2014) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","The easy-to-implement tasks that build studentsâ€™ understanding are the greatest strength of the text. In addition to the tasks highlighting common misconceptions of functions, a wealth of possible student answers and classroom vignettes helped me visualize how these tasks can be used in the classroom. I would have found it helpful to have access to printable versions of the tasks, so that edits could be made to fit the particular needs of a classroom while retaining the graph or diagram used for the task.",,
10,"Books, Products and Software Reviews (November 2014) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","This book is easy to read and understand. It has ready-to-use tasks  for the classroom that are designed  to deepen studentsâ€™ understanding of functions, a critical topic not only in secondary school but also in higher-level mathematics.",,
11,"Books, Products and Software Reviews (November 2014) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Taking the importance of functions for much of mathematics into account, I highly recommend Putting Essential Understanding of Functions into Practice, 9-12 for prealgebra through calculus teachers as well as for instructional coaches. This book is a practical guide on how to introduce and build on a conceptual knowledge of functions.",,

19,"Books, Products and Software Reviews (November 2014) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Working with  Pentominoes is  written for grade levels 4â€“8, although the author claims that some of the lessons can be used with higher-level grades. The content focuses on encouraging students to learn about pentominoes to solve mathematical problems by using hands-on materials that are provided in the book.",,
20,"Books, Products and Software Reviews (November 2014) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics",The strengths of the book are that it includes games and manipulatives to engage students in geometry and is versatile enough to be used for alternate grade levels. It contains visual stimulation and gross-motor-skill tasks to engage special education students in developing abilities in geometry. It is easy for educators to use the materials in the classroom with the help of the CD.,,
21,"Books, Products and Software Reviews (November 2014) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Including correlations to the Common Core, for example, in geometry might have been helpful. Incorporating more detailed instructions might also have been helpful for elementary educators who are unfamiliar with pentominoes and to let them know that there are possible alternate solutions to some of the problems.",,
22,"Books, Products and Software Reviews (November 2014) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","The materials can be used from grade 1 (with modification). I would recommend that the author provide supplementary materials, if possible. Another idea is for the author to have included activities at the end of the book that encompass all topics. In so doing, these additional items would help readers understand the bigger picture of learning and using pentominoes.",,
