2,3D Designing for Mathematical Learning,"Access to three-dimensional, or 3D, design and printing technologies has generated new opportunities to teach and learn in new ways and even to think in new ways about what teaching and learning mathematics might look like. Not only does this access facilitate the production of physical tools to better teach the concepts that we have been teaching all along, we can also produce tools that enable innovative mathematical explorations and investigations (Cochran et al. 2016). One of this article’s authors designed such a tool that we call Thirty6. He then brought it to the other two authors and asked, “What could you do with this in a math classroom?” In this article we introduce Thirty6 and describe how the tool was devised. Then we share some of the tasks we dreamed up, some of which were used in classrooms. We conclude by providing resources for mathematics educators who wish to design and produce their own mathematical tools. ",2,3D Designing for Mathematical Learning

The red 6 × 6 grid with raised edges can be used as a workspace for the smaller tiles. The smaller (nontrivial) tiles are not partitioned into a 1 × 1, which can present a challenge to students when they are comparing the size of a tile in relation to the red grid. This will be important in understanding the relationship between the grid and the tiles and will depend on the assignment of values to the overall grid or to individual tiles.

8,3D Designing for Mathematical Learning,"Thirty6 was designed using a free,  browser-based 3D design environment called Tinkercad™ (Autodesk Inc. 2016). Tinkercad uses a straightforward “add and subtract” scheme for building shapes through compositions and decompositions of built-in solids. A tutorial is available at its website, http://tinkercad.com. Then Thirty6  was printed on a Makerbot Replicator® 3D printer (http://makerbot.",8,3D Designing for Mathematical Learning

Or you can download a paper-based version of the tool from http://tiny.cc/Thirty6.  ",10,3D Designing for Mathematical Learning
11,3D Designing for Mathematical Learning,"Thirty6 was devised with the  framework of generative design in mind (Stroup, Ares, and Hurford 2005). Generative design refers to the means of “orchestrating classroom activity in ways that occasion productive and  expressive engagement by participants” (p. 188). Whereas tutoringtype problems like “What is 2x + 2x?” collapse the space to a single point because there is a single solution, generative tasks like “What are two things that are the same as 4x?” are generative because they are productive of a diversity of responses—they open up the space. Although generative design has typically been used as a framework of task design for students, Thirty6 was designed for generativity at the teacher level. The tool is used to generate a space in which teachers design new tasks that will help them accomplish their instructional goals.",11,3D Designing for Mathematical Learning
12,3D Designing for Mathematical Learning,Four of the Thirty6-based tasks we designed and implemented are outlined below.,12,3D Designing for Mathematical Learning
13,3D Designing for Mathematical Learning,TASK 1: FINDING SUMS WITH UNIT FRACTIONS,13,3D Designing for Mathematical Learning
14,3D Designing for Mathematical Learning,"Asking students to find unit fractions whose sum is 1 commonly generates responses like 1/2 + 1/2, 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/4, and 1/3 + 1/3 + 1/3. To open up this space, ask students to do the following: 1. Find a collection of tiles that will cover the 6 × 6 grid without overlapping the tiles or leaving gaps between them.  2. Then assume that the whole grid  represents 1. Find the fraction that is represented by each tile, and then write a number sentence that represents the sum of the fractions that are placed on the grid.",14,3D Designing for Mathematical Learning
15,3D Designing for Mathematical Learning,Two possible arrangements of tiles that represent a sum of 1 are shown in figure 3. ,15,3D Designing for Mathematical Learning
16,3D Designing for Mathematical Learning,"After enabling students to share  their findings in a whole-class discussion, direct pairs of students, “Find three more collections of fractions whose sum is 1. Choose the one you find most interesting to share with the class.” Friendly competition for the  most interesting collection may follow from such a challenge. The arrangements shown in figure 3 illustrate examples that can result from this friendly challenge.",16,3D Designing for Mathematical Learning
17,3D Designing for Mathematical Learning,"An important concept explored  in this task is the meaning of the whole. The task requires students  to properly identify fractions represented by each tile. Although seemingly basic, this preliminary step can present a challenge to some students. Without the correct labeling of each tile, the students could successfully cover the grid without correctly answering the question. ",17,3D Designing for Mathematical Learning

24,3D Designing for Mathematical Learning,"Fig. 5 Students can use Thirty6 to find fractions of a whole number, such as 2/9 of 36.",24,3D Designing for Mathematical Learning
25,3D Designing for Mathematical Learning,"Table 1 shows the size and fraction  amount of each tile (the 6 × 6 grid is the whole). Note that fractions 1/6 and 1/9 are represented by two different tiles each (e.g., 1/6 is represented by 1 × 6 and 2 × 3).",25,3D Designing for Mathematical Learning
26,3D Designing for Mathematical Learning,"Teachers can build on this task in a variety of ways. Here are some suggestions. When the 6 × 6 grid is the whole— •   instead of making 1, students can identify tiles whose arrangement makes other sums (e.g., 1/2, 1/4);  •   the tiles could be arranged into shapes representing mixed numbers; and •   the students could search for the biggest number made with all the tiles combined (see fig. 4).",26,3D Designing for Mathematical Learning
27,3D Designing for Mathematical Learning,"When the 6 × 6 grid is not the whole— •   just as any block in a set of base-ten blocks can be assigned the value of 1, any tile in Thirty6 can represent the whole. The students can then identify the fraction amounts of the remaining pieces, including the value of the 6 × 6 grid itself; and  •   the 6 × 6 grid can represent a  number other than 1 (e.g., 2,   1 1/2, 18). The students can identify a set of fractions (and whole numbers) whose sum is equal to the value assigned to the grid. ",27,3D Designing for Mathematical Learning
28,3D Designing for Mathematical Learning,TASK 2: WHICH FRACTION IS LARGER THAN 1/9?,28,3D Designing for Mathematical Learning
29,3D Designing for Mathematical Learning,"Thirty6 can be used as a tool for activities in fraction equivalence and comparison. With the grid acting as a whole, what considerations arise in comparing, say, 1/6 to 1/9? Each fraction is represented by two different tiles: 1/6 by 1 × 6 and 2 × 3, and 1/9 by 2 × 2 and 1 × 4. For each fraction, the tiles can be different in shape but must be equal in area. However, the tiles for 1/6 are different in both shape and size from those for 1/9. Because the tiles for 1/6 are larger than those for 1/9, then 1/6 is greater than 1/9.  to interesting discussions about the meaning of a common denominator. ",29,3D Designing for Mathematical Learning
30,3D Designing for Mathematical Learning,TASK 3: WHAT IS 2/9 OF 36?,30,3D Designing for Mathematical Learning
31,3D Designing for Mathematical Learning,"Thirty6 can be used to find fractions of a whole number. For instance, to find 2/9 of 36, or 2/9 × 36, we can identify 2 (nonoverlapping) oneninths of the grid by first identifying 1/9 of the grid and then making a second copy. Figure 5 shows one such arrangement. It demonstrates that 2/9 of 36 is equal to 8, which is the total number of shaded squares. ",31,3D Designing for Mathematical Learning
32,3D Designing for Mathematical Learning,"If the 6 × 6 grid represents the number 36, other multiplication problems involving a fraction of 36 can be developed (e.g., 1/4 × 36,  3/18 × 36). The 6 × 6 grid could also represent a number other than 36. Here are some possibilities:",32,3D Designing for Mathematical Learning
33,3D Designing for Mathematical Learning,"Whereas any two tiles can be com- •   If the grid is 72, what is 1/36 of 72?  pared by measuring their respective areas, each tile is also a collection of thirty-sixths because one square unit represents 1/36 of the grid. Since 1/6 is 6 thirty-sixths and 1/9 is 4 thirtysixths, we can show that 1/6 is larger than 1/9 by exactly 2 thirty-sixths. A teacher could then open up the space again and ask, “What other fractions are larger than 1/9?” This could lead  1/2 of 72? 1/9 of 72? 5/36 of 72? •   If the grid is 72, how can we use it to find 2/9 of 36? What if the grid is 18? What if the grid is 9?  •   If 1/9 of the grid is 8, what is the value of the grid? 5/9 of the grid? •   If the grid is x, what expression does 1/2 of the grid represent? What is the combined value of the 1/2 and 1/3 tiles?",33,3D Designing for Mathematical Learning
34,3D Designing for Mathematical Learning,TASK 4: AND JUST FOR FUN!,34,3D Designing for Mathematical Learning
35,3D Designing for Mathematical Learning,"Given Thirty6’s footing in generative design, it is not surprising that some of the authors’ investigations with it reflected a “zigzag” (Lakatos 1976, p. 42) nature, generating observations that were pretty and fun but not immediately valuable. But doing mathematics admits such experiences and even holds out hope that sharing them with others will open up the space for further investigation or discovery! Elicit and explore these with students as well! Here is one possible wording for such a task, perhaps during a “Do Now,” on special schedule days, or as an additional learning opportunity:",35,3D Designing for Mathematical Learning
36,3D Designing for Mathematical Learning,You have a 6 × 6 grid with smaller grids at your desk. Use your imagination and what you know about mathematics to play with these. What discoveries do you make?,36,3D Designing for Mathematical Learning
37,3D Designing for Mathematical Learning,"One of our own discoveries began  with the observation that 36 is a triangular number (36 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8). With Thirty6, we noted that 36 is square, so that 36 = 62  and  36 = 6, 36 = 6 is triangular! which is the side length of the 6 × 6 grid. Arranging the “1,” “2,” and “3” tiles along a side of the grid (see  fig. 6) revealed to us that 6 is also triangular because 6 = 1 + 2 + 3, that is, the square root of this triangular number is also triangular! (This finding led us to wonder, “Are there other triangular numbers whose square roots are also triangular?”)",37,3D Designing for Mathematical Learning
38,3D Designing for Mathematical Learning,"Thirty6’s squareness irresistibly drew us to completing squares. For example, completing the square on  x2 + 6x could be modeled with appropriate tiles and side-length assignments (see fig. 7). Are there other squares that can be completed with Thirty6? Would the reader consider opening up ",38,3D Designing for Mathematical Learning

42,3D Designing for Mathematical Learning,"These are just two of the multiple discoveries that emerged as we played with Thirty6. As with all the tasks we posed, our experiences suggest that generatively designed physical manipulatives can provide teachers with new opportunities for innovative mathematical instruction.",42,3D Designing for Mathematical Learning
43,3D Designing for Mathematical Learning,NEW TOOLS AND NEW OPPORTUNITIES,43,3D Designing for Mathematical Learning
44,3D Designing for Mathematical Learning,"Inspired by the promise of new 3D technologies and the proposition that new tools make innovation possible, this article provides a case study of how a tool called Thirty6 was designed and used in classrooms by mathematics teachers in their own varied and invented ways. Unlike established manipulatives that are designed to support the learning of a particular concept, Thirty6 was developed from a generative design perspective to be used by teachers who can decide what instructional purpose it might serve. ",44,3D Designing for Mathematical Learning
45,3D Designing for Mathematical Learning,We offer this case study of Thirty6  not merely as a guide for possible re-implementation by the reader but as an exemplar of the possibilities afforded by easy access to 3D design tools and printers. Our hope is that other mathematics teachers are inspired by this approach to develop their own tools and undertake their own journey toward making meaning with students. ,45,3D Designing for Mathematical Learning
