"Ratios and Proportions:  They Are Not All Greek to Me tToday, the concept of number includes  the sets of whole numbers, integers, rational numbers, and real numbers. This was not always so. At the time of Euclid (circa 330−270 BC), the only numbers used were whole numbers. To express quantitative relationships among geometric objects, such as line segments, triangles, circles, and spheres, the Greeks used ratios and proportions but not real numbers (fractions or irrational numbers). Although today we have full use of the number system, we still find ratios and proportions useful and effective when comparing quantities. In this article, we examine the history of ratios and proportions and their value to people from the past through the present.",2,mtms2009-02-370a,,
"A ratio is a quotient of two  mathematical expressions, such as 3/4 or p/d. The ratio a/b can also be expressed as a:b. A proportion is an equation that sets two ratios equal to each other, such as 3/4 = 6/8. A proportion written as a/b = c/d can also be expressed as a:b::c:d.",3,mtms2009-02-370a,,
early Use of ratios and ProPortions,4,mtms2009-02-370a,,
"One well-known ratio can be traced back to ancient times, specifically, the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter. We refer to this constant ratio as p. Ancient people reasoned that since all circles have the same shape, they are all similar. Representing the circumference of two circles by C1 and C2 and their diameters by d1 and d2, respectively, this similarity yields the proportion C1:d1::C2:d2. Thus, the ratio of circumference to diameter is the same for all circles. (See fig. 1.) The activity sheets help students develop estimations of that ratio.",5,mtms2009-02-370a,,
"The use of ratios and proportions  dates back to the sixth century BC and the mathematician Thales (625−547 BC). As a merchant, Thales traveled to Egypt and learned geometry. He impressed the Egyptians with his ability to measure the height of the Great Pyramid using only his staff. According to the Greek historian Plutarch (circa AD 46−120), Thales ",6,mtms2009-02-370a,,

Symbolically, this is expressed as h1/h2 = s1/s2. To set up this ratio, Thales relied on the proposition that the sides of similar triangles are proportional. He is credited with proving this proposition. (See fig. 2.) Thales brought this knowledge of geometry back to Greece, where a rigorous study of the subject developed.

"Mathematicians based their theory of ratios and proportions on an assumption that the Pythagoreans later determined was incorrect. These early mathematicians believed that for any two lengths, call them a and b, there was another length c such that a and b were multiples of this other length c. Using this common length, they could express the ratio, or relative magnitudes, of the lengths a and b (Eves 1983, pp. 55−56). ",9,mtms2009-02-370a,,
"Example 1 Suppose we have a stick that is a = 6 inches long and another that is b = 8 inches long. We can use a stick of length c = 1 inch for the common length. Our first stick is 6 times c and our second is 8 times c. Thus, we could represent the ratio of the lengths as 6/8, or 6:8. (See fig. 3.)",10,mtms2009-02-370a,,
Example 2,11,mtms2009-02-370a,,
"Consider 2 sticks of lengths a = 3 1/2 feet and b = 5 feet, respectively. We could use 1/2 foot as a length for c. Then the first stick is 7 times the length of c and the second is 10 times the length of c. Thus, the ratio of the lengths is 7/10, or 7:10. ",12,mtms2009-02-370a,,

"When the Pythagoreans applied the method of ratios to certain right triangles for comparing the lengths of legs, all went well. Consider a 3-4-5 triangle (the leg lengths are 3 and 4,  and the hypotenuse length is 5). Using a common length of 1, the ratio of the shorter leg to the hypotenuse is 3:5. There is no problem here: We have a ratio of whole numbers. Again, in a 5-12-13 triangle and with c = 1, the  fig. 4 Two triangles with common height h but bases of different lengths ratio of the shorter leg to the hypotenuse is 5:13, also a ratio of whole numbers. However, the Pythagoreans learned that it is not always possible to find a common length c. When they tried to find a common length for the diagonal of a unit square and a side of this square, they discovered the unwelcome news that the length of this diagonal is the irrational number 12. This ratio of a diagonal to a side would not be a whole number or even a rational number. Legend has it that this news was so unwelcome that the Pythagoreans tried to keep this discovery a secret. It is also said that a Pythagorean who leaked the story either died at sea or was dismissed from the community and treated as dead (Eves 1983, p. 56). The existence of irrational numbers meant that the Pythagorean theory of proportion was limited in its use and that a new theory was needed.  a solid theory",18,mtms2009-02-370a,,
"Eudoxus created a theory of proportion that relied on geometry and was therefore applicable to all lengths. This theory is the content of Book V of Euclid’s The Elements. In this book, Eudoxus defines a ratio as being the following: ",19,mtms2009-02-370a,,
"A ratio is a sort of relation in respect of size between two magnitudes of the same kind. (Heath 1956, p. 115)",20,mtms2009-02-370a,,
"Note that this definition resembles that given earlier, but Eudoxus required that the quantities be of the same type, meaning that lengths can only be compared with lengths, areas with areas, and volumes with volumes. There would be no mixing of dimensions as we do when we compare the area of a circle to the length of its radius. In this book, Eudoxus also gave a definition of equal ratios, that is,  of a proportion; however, we  will wait to look at this idea in the context of ratios and proportions  of numbers.",21,mtms2009-02-370a,,

"Once the formal work of the theory of proportions was completed in Book V of The Elements, the results could be applied to geometric objects. Some of the resulting propositions state the familiar properties of similar figures. The first proposition of Book VI states: ",23,mtms2009-02-370a,,
"Triangles and parallelograms which are under the same height are to one another as their bases. (Heath 1956, p. 38) ",24,mtms2009-02-370a,,
"We would express this by saying that the ratio of the areas of two triangles with the same height is equal to the ratio of their bases. To view the proportion symbolically, we suppose triangles 1 and 2 have the same height; the areas of the triangles are denoted A1 and A2, respectively; and their bases are denoted b1 and b2, respectively. The proposition can now be expressed using the proportion A1/A2 = b1/b2.",25,mtms2009-02-370a,,
Example 3,26,mtms2009-02-370a,,
Suppose that triangles 1 and 2 have the same height; the base of triangle 1 is 5 and that of triangle 2 is 7. Then we say A1/A2 = 5/7. ,27,mtms2009-02-370a,,
Many of the well-known results  about similar triangles are included in Book VI. ,28,mtms2009-02-370a,,
"Since the Greeks were great  geometers, they also studied circles. We know that the area of a circle with radius r is pr2. The Greeks dealt only with whole numbers, so how were they able to understand the area of a circle? They did not present a formula for area, but instead related the area of one circle to that of another by comparing their diameters. In Book XII, we find the statement: ",29,mtms2009-02-370a,,
"Circles are to one another as the squares of their diameters. (Heath 1956, p. 372) ",30,mtms2009-02-370a,,
We can express this relation using ratios and proportions. We would say that the ratio of the areas of two circles is equal to the ratio of their squared diameters. We write this symbolically as and in terms of radii as ,31,mtms2009-02-370a,,
"As mentioned, ratios for the Greeks were between objects of the same kind. Notice that in the two ratios above, we compare area to area and length to length. If we ignore this restriction of the Greeks, we can rewrite the proportion as",32,mtms2009-02-370a,,
"We know that this ratio is p. Even though the Greeks did not give this ratio its name, they recognized that for all circles the ratio of the area to the squared radius is constant, or the same, for all circles.",33,mtms2009-02-370a,,

"Thus far, we have concentrated on ratios and proportions as they appear in geometry. It is just as likely that our students will deal with ratios in a purely algebraic setting. In this context, we will look at the idea of proportion. In Proposition 19 of Book VII (Heath 1956, p. 318) we find our familiar test for the truth of a proportion. This proposition claims that a:b::c:d if ad = bc. Let us return to example 1.",35,mtms2009-02-370a,,
Example 1 Revisited,36,mtms2009-02-370a,,
"We could also have chosen c = 1/2 inch for the common length. In this case, the first stick is 12 times as long as c, and the second stick is 16 times as long as c. This gives us a ratio of 12/16. Is this the same ratio we obtained before? That is, can we say 6/8 = 12/16? Fortunately, we find that 6 • 16 and 8 • 12 are 96.",37,mtms2009-02-370a,,
