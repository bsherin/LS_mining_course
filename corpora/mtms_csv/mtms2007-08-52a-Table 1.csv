"Exploring Quadratic Functions through Children’s Literature mMany middle school students do  not realize that functions and mathematical relations are present in their everyday lives. For example, the number of calories a student burns is a function of how long the student runs; the amount of pizza available to be eaten is a function of the diameter of the pizza. These examples of functions found in our daily lives can be described in a variety of ways, including with tables, graphs, and possibly symbolic generalizations. Many students do not realize that functions and relations exist outside of the mathematics classroom and that they can be represented in numerous ways (Billings and Lakatos 2003).",4,mtms2007-08-52a,,
"As a result of their mathematics experiences, students should be able to •	 identify, learn, and use mathematics in contexts outside of mathematics; •	 compare and contrast various forms of representations for relationships; •	 identify whether a function is  linear or nonlinear and recognize differences in the representations of the two types of functions; and •	 use symbolic algebra to represent  situations.

This article presents three activities that can be used with the children’s book Bats on Parade (Appelt 1999); a fourth activity can be used with Bat Jamboree (Appelt 1996). All four activities are intended to help students understand quadratic functions. The contexts in the stories result in the relationships y = x2, y = x2 + 1,  y = x2 + x, and y = (1/2)(x2 + x). Students create tables, graphs, and symbolic generalizations for one function at a time and explore each new function by comparing their new work with the functions that preceded them. ",10,mtms2007-08-52a,,
"Eighth-grade students in a geometry class completed these four activities in approximately two and one-half hours. In each activity, students were encouraged to work in small groups. ",11,mtms2007-08-52a,,
"The Bats Go Marching 1 × 1: Sheet 1 The first activity is based on the story Bats on Parade in which a crowd waits with anticipation for the famous Bat Marching Band to appear. The band is led by the sole drum majorette marching 1 × 1, followed by the piccolos marching 2 × 2, and then the flutes marching 3 × 3. The members of the band continue marching in this pattern, which ends with the sousaphones that proudly march 10 × 10.",12,mtms2007-08-52a,,
"After reading the story aloud, teachers should give each student a copy of sheet 1 and some graph paper. Students first complete a table based on the relationship between the group number and the number of band members in the group. For this first activity, group number 1 marches 1 × 1; group number 2 marches 2 × 2; group number 3 marches 3 × 3, and so on. Then students predict the number of band members in the 13th, 27th, 100th, and nth groups based on patterns they find in the table. Our students recognized that to find the number of band members in the group, they “square the group number” or “multiply the group number by itself.”",13,mtms2007-08-52a,,
"Students verbally describe a relationship to find the number of band members in the group if they know the group number; this verbal description will help them create a symbolic generalization for the relationship. It is important for students to define their variables. As students use their verbal descriptions to determine an equation, they begin to connect the various types of representations for a particular relationship.",14,mtms2007-08-52a,,
"Finally, students graph the data in  their table, which they use to predict the number of band members in the 13th group, compare their results with the graph and table, and recognize that both representations lead to the same result. ",15,mtms2007-08-52a,,
On Guard! Sheet 2,16,mtms2007-08-52a,,
"The activity “On Guard!” is also based on Bats on Parade. The relationship explored is similar to that in sheet 1, but in this situation each group that joins the parade contains the band members and one member of the color guard. This relationship is inspired by the illustrations in the story: Marching along with each of the marching bat groups is one mouse carrying a flag.",17,mtms2007-08-52a,,
"Each student completes sheet  2 by using their work from sheet 1. Students insert data from the table completed in sheet 1 into column B to make connections between the two scenarios. Once the table is completed, students predict the number of marchers in the 13th group of the parade and relate their answer to that obtained in sheet 1. Finally, students use a different color to graph the new data on the graph from sheet 1 and note any similarities and differences. When students in the class created their table, they realized the number of marchers in the group is 1 more than the number of band members in the group. To make their prediction for the number of marchers in the 13th group of the parade, students used their answer from sheet 1 and added 1 more  to make their prediction, thus showing their understanding of the connections between the relationships. After studying both graphs, students recognized that they are the same shaped curve. However, when examining corresponding x-values, students realized that the y-values for the second relationship are 1 greater than the y-values for the relationship explored in sheet 1. Students found that sliding the graph from sheet 1, y = x2, up one unit along the y-axis would give them the graph of y = x2 + 1. ",18,mtms2007-08-52a,,
"Two discussions emerged at the  conclusion of sheet 2. One group asked whether they should connect the points on their graphs and concluded that the points on the graph should not be connected because it is impossible to have a fraction of a group, in other words, the data are not continuous. The entire class debated the topic and agreed with the group’s conclusion. ",19,mtms2007-08-52a,,
"The second discussion resulted from students believing that the two relationships explored thus far were exponential because of the shape of the graphs. To clarify this issue, the students examined three data tables: a linear relationship  y = x, a quadratic relationship y = x2, and an exponential relationship y = 2x. As a class, students identified patterns in the tables. In the table for y = x, they noted that the y-values increase by 1 for each x-value increase of 1; in the table for y = x2, the y-values were 1, 4, 9, 16, . . . and the difference of the first two values was 4 – 1 = 3, the difference of the second two values was 9 – 4 = 5, and so on, so the differences increased by 2 (see table 1); in the table for y = 2x, each y-value has to be multiplied by 2 to get the next y-value in the table. Students reexamined the tables and determined that the type of relationships explored in the first two activities were quadratic.",20,mtms2007-08-52a,,
More Flag Fun: Sheet 3,21,mtms2007-08-52a,,
The activity “More Flag Fun” (sheet 3) also refers to sheet 1. This time the story is adapted so that the number of  table 1 Students identify patterns y = x2 16 25,22,mtms2007-08-52a,,
"Differences in the y-Values 1 – 0 = 1 4 – 1 = 3 9 – 4 = 5 16 – 9 = 7 25 – 16 = 9 members of the color guard in each group is the same as the number of the group that has joined the parade. That is, the first group has one color guard member and one band member. The second group has two color guard members and four band members. The third group has three color guard members and nine band members, and so on. Students complete sheet 3 using  graph paper and their work from sheet 2. Students complete a table for this new relationship in which column C represents the new scenario being explored; columns A and B again represent group number and number of band members in the group, respectively. Students recognized that the sum of the values in column A and column B equals the value in column C, and used this pattern to describe the relationship verbally: The group number plus the number of band members in the group equals the number of marchers in the group. Some students used the table and others their verbal description to determine the symbolic generalization y = x2 + x. ",23,mtms2007-08-52a,,
"Students graphed both relationships  shown in the table and made observations relating the graphs, including the following: The graph for sheet 3 rises more quickly than the graph for sheet 2; the y-value for the graph for sheet 3 is always greater than the y-value for the graph for sheet 2.",24,mtms2007-08-52a,,
And the Bats Play On: Sheet 4,25,mtms2007-08-52a,,
"The final quadratic exploration is based on the book Bat Jamboree (Appelt 1999). In the story, the crowd waits  for the Bat Jamboree, starring 55 bats, to begin. First, 1 bat sings, then 2 bats flap, then 3 bats dance the cha-cha. Groups of bats, all performing in a different fashion, continue joining the Bat Jamboree until a group of 10 acrobats performs the finale. In this scenario, the relationship between the group number and the number of bats that has performed so far is explored. This relationship, although quadratic, is not obvious from the way the groups are constructed; it was more evident in the marching scenarios. However, the exploration helps students use what they have learned from the tables and graphs they created in the previous student pages to realize that this accumulation of bats results in a related pattern. ",26,mtms2007-08-52a,,
"In this activity, students complete  a table to explore the relationship between the performance number and the total number of bats that have performed so far. Then they compare this table to the table created in sheet 3 (focusing on the relationship between the group number and the number of marchers in the group). Students observed that the total number of bats that have performed so far is half the number of sheet 3 marchers in the group for corresponding x-values.",27,mtms2007-08-52a,,
"Because students have graphed  several quadratic relationships by this point, students predict that the graph for this relationship will appear to be quadratic before graphing it. Students gave a variety of answers when asked how the two graphs are similar and different, such as that the graph for sheet 4  is wider than the graph for sheet 3, the graph for sheet 4 is half as high as the graph for sheet 3, the graph for sheet 3 is steeper than the graph for sheet 4, and the graphs have different growth rates.",28,mtms2007-08-52a,,
"Even though students recognized  the total number of bats that have performed so far is half the number of marchers in the group, they did not use this connection to determine a simple explicit formula for the relationship between the performance number and the total number of bats. Rather, every student developed either a recursive formula or a formula that they were unable to simplify. Students found two relationships to determine the total number of bats that had performed: (1) students added the current performance number, x, to each previous performance number (including performance one) to result in the equation y = x + (x – 1) + ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ + 1; (2) students added the current performance number to the total number of bats that had performed at the conclusion of the previous performance, giving the equation t = p + b, where t is the total number of bats that have performed so far, p is the current performance number, and b is the total number of bats that had performed at the conclusion of the previous performance.",29,mtms2007-08-52a,,
"To find a simple explicit formula  for the relationship, students reflected on the pattern found between the tables in sheets 3 and 4. They used this knowledge and the symbolic generalization (y = x2 + x) to determine the equation to represent the relationship in sheet 1 as y = (1/2)(x2 + x). ",30,mtms2007-08-52a,,
Extensions,31,mtms2007-08-52a,,
"Numerous extensions are inspired by this lesson and the bat stories. For example, the performing bats in Bat Jamboree fly in for the finale and form a pyramid one level at a time. The bottom level of the pyramid, level 1, contains ten bats. The second level from the bottom of the pyramid, level 2, has nine ",32,mtms2007-08-52a,,

"So Far for sheet 4 1 + 2 = 3 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 10 15 21 28 36 45 55 bats. The pattern in the pyramid continues in this fashion, with the top level of the pyramid consisting of one bat. If students are not yet ready to study quadratic functions, the bat pyramid can be used to introduce linear functions by investigating the pyramid level and the number of bats at that level of the pyramid (y = 11 – x). Students can explore the quadratic function y = –(1/2)x2 + 10.5x by focusing on the relationship between the pyramid level and the total number of bats in the pyramid. Students who are ready to challenge themselves beyond quadratic functions can investigate the total number of bats as each group joins the parade in Bats on Parade (y = (1/3)x3 + (1/2)x2 + (1/6)x). A variety of other relationships are also found in the two stories. ",45,mtms2007-08-52a,,
"Teachers can adapt the story to  create their own scenarios to represent other functions. For example, the relationship investigated in sheet 3 was not found directly in the story Bats on Parade but was created because of its connections to sheet 2 and to segue into sheet 4. ",46,mtms2007-08-52a,,
"Students can investigate connections between different relationships  than those in these activities. For example, students might find a factored form of the equation in “More Flag Fun” to notice the relationship between the x-intercepts of the graph and the equation of the quadratic function. They might also consider the relationships between each of the quadratic functions in terms of the replacements for the parameters a, c, and d in the equation y = a(x + c)2 + d. Although the students completed  the activities by graphing each relationship by hand, teachers could have students use graphing calculators to find relationships among the various graphs or even to use a spreadsheet. They can also study additional members of the quadratic family of functions using these and related functions.",47,mtms2007-08-52a,,
conclUsion,48,mtms2007-08-52a,,
These activities provide students with a unique and interesting context in which to build an understanding of quadratic functions. The activities enable students to find and understand the connections among quadratic function family members and the different  representations for the functions. ,49,mtms2007-08-52a,,
"Middle-grades students love hearing children’s stories; stories motivate them to learn and explore the mathematics embedded within the stories. Relationships in some stories are obvious, easy to find, and arise directly from the story, such as in “The Bats Go Marching 1 × 1” and “And the Bats Play On.” Other relationships are hidden, as in “On Guard!” and some require that the story be adapted, as in “More Flag Fun” (Billings and Beckmann 2005).
