"Our commonly used temperature scales were developed in the 1700s by astronomer Anders Celsius and  physicist Daniel Fahrenheit. On the Celsius scale, water freezes at 0° and water boils at 100°; the interval between the two is divided into 100 equal parts called degrees Celsius (°C). On the Fahrenheit scale, the freezing point of water is 32° and the boiling point of water is 212°.  1. How many degrees are between the freezing and boiling temperatures on the Fahrenheit scale? 2. Since the temperatures at which  water freezes and boils are constants, 0°C = 32°F and 100°C = 212°F. Complete the table at the bottom of the page. ",6,mtms2010-10-142a,,

They said the numbers were easier to remember in Celsius and that they had been using them in science recently. I asked if they knew how to convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius. They thought that it must be a subtraction of some number. ",31,mtms2010-10-142a,,
"At that point, I showed them the cartoon. They asked if the formulas they were working with were correct. I replied that they were, but that we would be using the table to determine exactly why. ",32,mtms2010-10-142a,,
"I asked them to work with a partner and fill out the table as I circulated. They found the table difficult to fill out. The missing points were strategically placed to force them to  use a calculator. Even then, they were unclear if their answers were making sense. Many students could not find the ratio for conversion even when reminded that we had studied this topic extensively a month earlier. The standard response was to find the equivalence of 1°C in the Fahrenheit scale and vice versa, instead of finding the conversion ratio. What made this doubly challenging to them was subtracting or adding 32 degrees. ",33,mtms2010-10-142a,,

"We had just completed our studies of weather in science class when we worked on this lesson. The students liked the cartoon, and it piqued their interest in what we were going to learn. They especially liked being able to discover how the temperature conversions were developed. Converting Fahrenheit to Celsius gave them a better feel for temperatures in their surroundings. This lesson was also a great review for order of operations. The students enjoyed learning how to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit mentally.",40,mtms2010-10-142a,,

"The activity proved very challenging for nearly all the students. I started by asking them what they thought the temperature was outside. After fielding some estimates (between 45° and 50°), I looked up the temperature on my iPod Touch (set to Celsius before the lesson) and showed them that the temperature was 12 degrees. There was an initial gasp until they realized that the screen was showing the temperature in Celsius. ",44,mtms2010-10-142a,,
"When asked what cued them  about this, they responded that they knew the Celsius temperatures used numbers quite a bit smaller than Fahrenheit.
