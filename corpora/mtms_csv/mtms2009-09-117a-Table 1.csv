This series of paperback books intends to entertain students while teaching mathematics. The targeted audience is nine- to twelve-year-olds. The story of a villain who removes numbers from the community to create chaos provides the setting for measurement and estimation skills in context. Teen super- heroes come to the aid of the mayor.,3,mtms2009-09-117a,,
"Measurement and estimation skills  are important topics that are often given limited attention in mathematics classes. The historical development of English standard units, followed by attention to metric measurement, is also part of the story.",4,mtms2009-09-117a,,
"I read the first chapter aloud to  seventh-grade mathematics students and asked them to write their reactions. The majority response was that it is a book for “little kids” (they said third grade). Although the focus on measurement is an important middle school topic, the story context is better matched to younger students.",5,mtms2009-09-117a,,
The book is recommended with caution. The context helps facilitate some standards-based attention to connections and reasoning. Having one classroom set of the books that students can read independently and ,6,mtms2009-09-117a,,

The book covers content fairly completely, including origin of units, estimation, truncation, mental arithmetic, rounding and “nice numbers,” compensating estimates, and sampling. I found four errors that teachers need to address, such as that a two-liter soda is slightly less than two quarts. ",7,mtms2009-09-117a,,

The Big Book of Math Communicator Templates for Grades K−12 is a reproducible book designed for use with the Communicator® clearboard. ,11,mtms2009-09-117a,,
"The Communicator clearboard is a 10 in. × 13 in. plastic sleeve into which various templates, teacher-created materials, or blank paper can be inserted. Dry-erase markers can then be used for write-on and wipe-off activities. ",12,mtms2009-09-117a,,
"The book contains more than 200 templates based on twenty different broad ideas found in mathematics. Chapter topics include number sense and place value; measurement; algebra and algebraic thinking; and assessments, games, and manipulatives. The book’s overview suggests how to establish routines and manage Communicator templates as well as sample activities and suggestions for using the templates for each topic. Most of the templates are related to elementary school mathematics content, but some are useful for secondary school as well.",13,mtms2009-09-117a,,
I have found that both students and teachers enjoy using the Communicator clearboards and templates. They hold students’ interest and keep the entire class actively involved while teachers can assess each student’s understanding of the material. Teachers can then instantly adjust instruction as necessary.,14,mtms2009-09-117a,,
"I would recommend The Big Book of Math Communicator Templates for Grades K−12 as well as the Communicator clearboards. The book contains templates that represent commonly used manipulatives, such as base-ten blocks, geoboards, pattern blocks, tangrams, analog clocks, and money. Using these templates would allow all students access to some form of these manipulatives. Teachers can also easily create and use their own templates as necessary. The Communicator clearboards  are sturdy, versatile, and cost-effective. They can be used in any content area. Their use could potentially save on paper, copier, and manipulative costs. —Cheryl Gray, Post Oak and Chancellor Middle Schools, Spotsylvania, VA 22551 the complete idiot’s  guide to Pre-algebra Amy F.

"The book is designed to help refresh essential mathematics skills. Consisting of six major parts, the book examines number (including fractions and decimals), algebra, geometry, and data analysis. Each section includes explanations, sample problems worked step by step, definitions, and additional problems for practice. The solutions in the back of the book include detailed explanations. New topics begin with real-life questions and include  tongue-in-cheek descriptions of the usefulness of the skills.",16,mtms2009-09-117a,,
"The authors have attempted to cover a lot of material in 400 pages. The content includes everything from mentally calculating a waiter’s tip to properly using a protractor. Text boxes point out important definitions and practical tips to consider. The book is clearly written, and its tone is appealing. It was written under the assumption that the reader has some fear of mathematics. ",17,mtms2009-09-117a,,
"Some sections, however, are wordy,  and the reader has to sift through them to find the mathematical explanation. The book also lacks strong visual representations of concepts. For example, operations with integers are modeled using a number line only; no other model is presented. The fractions, decimals, and percent sections have almost no illustrations, which can be problematic for visual learners. ",18,mtms2009-09-117a,,
Multiple boxes of information on the same page can also be distracting.,19,mtms2009-09-117a,,
"In general, the book is potentially  useful as a review for a person struggling with prealgebra. It is generally easy to read and provides plenty of examples. It also covers a wide range of topics.",20,mtms2009-09-117a,,

"This book is primarily a biography, based on written and oral records, of the life of Emmy Noether, “the mother of modern algebra” (p. xiv). Because records of Noether’s life are sketchy at best, the author had to take liberties in presenting her life by building  stories around the records. ",22,mtms2009-09-117a,,
"These stories  reflect how Noether may have lived in Germany from 1882 to 1935 as a Jewish woman studying mathematics. Although written to encourage young adult females to “discover the magic of mathematics” (p. xi) and pursue study in the field, the book also serves to inspire mathematics teachers. Its presentation is not so much a flow as a series of connected vignettes.",23,mtms2009-09-117a,,
"Emmy Noether illustrates a woman who was unremarkable in appearance but brilliant of mind. Breaking the tradition of simply training women to keep house, Noether’s father taught her algebra. By going on to audit university classes, she earned a doctorate at age 25. ",24,mtms2009-09-117a,,

Her passion for mathematics  and her love of mentoring affected the lives of university students who were willing both to study diligently outside class and persevere through difficult lectures.

"Although respected mathematicians such as Fischer, Hilbert, Klein, and Einstein considered Noether a genius in the field of mathematics, she worked without a formal title or pay for over half her career.

"Despite racial and gender discrimination, she persevered to thrive and share her giftedness with others. ",34,mtms2009-09-117a,,
