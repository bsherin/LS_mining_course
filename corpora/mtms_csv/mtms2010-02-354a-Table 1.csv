Transitions from Middle  School to High School: Crossing the Bridge,2,mtms2010-02-354a,,
"This department provides a forum to stimulate discussion on contemporary curricular issues across a K–12 audience. NCTM has published sets of three articles, focused on a single curriculum issue. Each article has addressed the issue from the perspective of the audience of the journal in which it appears. Collectively, the articles were intended to increase communication and dialogue on issues of common interest related to curriculum. ",3,mtms2010-02-354a,,
"The beginning of every school year provides challenges to students from a variety of sources. This year’s teachers may structure their classrooms differently from last year’s teachers. Teachers at the same grade level may emphasize different topics. Teacher expectations for how students participate in instructional activities may differ. Students also face the problem of forgetting what they learned last year, especially if they have not used particular mathematical knowledge or skills over the summer months. Such annual challenges are minor in comparison with the challenges that students face during crucial transition points: from elementary school to middle school, from middle school to high school, and from high school to postsecondary education. This month, NCTM’s school journals take on these challenges with a set of three related articles by the team of Lisa Brown, Susan Hudson Hull, Janie Schielack, and Cathy Seeley. The series editors encourage you and your colleagues in grades K–12 to read and discuss these articles. Teachers’ dialogue within and across grade bands of a district can lead to improved articulation across grade levels and smoother transitions for students, particularly at key transition points.

"As students transition from middle school to high school, the academic landscape changes. This transition is complicated by a number of challenges—some general and some specific to mathematics—faced by students, educators, and families.  tRansitioning  to high school",5,mtms2010-02-354a,,
Some of the challenges that students face when they move from middle school mathematics to high school mathematics include— 1.  an insufficient alignment of mathematics instruction and curriculum across grades;  2.  issues with the initial mathematics  content typically taught in high school; and  3.  the psychological and social factors  influencing students’ beliefs and perceptions about their ability to learn difficult material. ,6,mtms2010-02-354a,,
"Despite these challenges, we can draw on a number of practices to help guide students through this critical transition toward greater success and opportunity in high school and beyond.",7,mtms2010-02-354a,,
Challenge: Alignment of  Instruction and Curriculum,8,mtms2010-02-354a,,
"Many students who are transitioning to high school are unprepared for high school math. Among them are students who may have been comfortable in elementary mathematics yet who did not fare well through the elementary school–middle school transition and now are on a downward trajectory as they work their way through middle school (Eccles, Lord, and Midgley 1991). Lower grades that many students receive may be related to a lack of alignment of teaching strategies and expectations between elementary and middle school mathematics. Middle school teachers often face more than 150 students every day. Consequently, their mathematics students may encounter fewer opportunities for hands-on exploration and less individualized attention than they received in elementary school. ",9,mtms2010-02-354a,,
"These differing instructional approaches can be related to the curriculum resources used in the different grade bands. Students are likely to experience one textbook series in elementary school, an entirely different series through middle school, and yet another series in high school. This lack of instructional and curricular alignment can negatively affect student performance. For example, during the elementary and middle school years, students may experience problemcentered curricula resources in which sense making is central to students’ learning but now find themselves in traditional high school classes where sense making is replaced with teacherdirected procedural instruction.",10,mtms2010-02-354a,,
Challenge: Content,11,mtms2010-02-354a,,
"Students who have done well in middle school mathematics may still face challenges during the transition to high school. For a large number of students across the country, algebra 1 is the first high school mathematics course they ",12,mtms2010-02-354a,,
"If we want to engage students in meaningful mathematics, it is critical that we do not underestimate what it takes to motivate them to be successful in school.",13,mtms2010-02-354a,,
"will face. Many schools offer an integrated mathematics sequence instead of traditionally organized courses such as algebra 1, geometry, and algebra 2. Whether algebra 1 is taught as part of an integrated program or in the traditional sequence of single-course emphases, similar issues can arise. ",14,mtms2010-02-354a,,
"Regardless of whether algebra 1  is taught in high school or in middle school, how well students do in this class can have a lasting effect on the rest of their high school mathematics study. Students’ success in algebra 1 may hinge on the quality and quantity of prior experiences in which they learn to reason about patterns, relationships, and representations. Additionally, it matters whether those prior experiences were closely aligned to the ways that algebra is taught and assessed in high school. ",15,mtms2010-02-354a,,
"Principles and Standards emphasizes the importance of proportional reasoning for success in algebra. If students are to be successful in high school mathematics, it is critical that they have ample opportunity to develop proportional reasoning skills across the middle grades. Facility with proportional reasoning must go beyond learning to use cross multiplication to solve for x in proportions such as",16,mtms2010-02-354a,,
"Opportunities to reason proportionally can be fostered across mathematical concepts or strands and across representations. Both probability and measurement offer fertile ground for exploring proportional reasoning. In addition, greater understanding of proportions can be developed when students are encouraged to reason about relationships among the numbers. Returning to the equation students who use mathematics flexibly may notice that the first ratio can be represented differently to work with it for different purposes. Rather than employing cross multiplication, the student can instead reason using scaling (or scale factors) and find that ",17,mtms2010-02-354a,,
"The ways in which teachers at  then easily conclude that various grade levels perceive algebra may also differ. For example, if algebra is perceived and taught as a way of solving equations (i.e., “find x,” where x stands for a number), then students may be inadequately prepared for a functions-based algebra course, as called for by Principles and Standards for School Mathematics (NCTM 2000).  to determine that x = 6. Students’ ability to re-represent numerical values is essential to later success in the more formal equation solving that is required in algebra and throughout high school.",18,mtms2010-02-354a,,
Challenge: Psychological  and Social Factors,19,mtms2010-02-354a,,
"The challenges of the transition to high school extend beyond issues of instructional and curricular alignment and of the mathematics content itself. The National Mathematics Advisory Panel (2008) surveyed several hundred teachers to better understand their experiences teaching algebra. The panel’s final report stated that 62 percent of the teachers surveyed reported “working with unmotivated students” as the single most challenging aspect of successfully teaching algebra 1. If we want to engage students in meaningful mathematics, it is critical that we do not underestimate what it takes to motivate them to be successful in school. ",20,mtms2010-02-354a,,
"One important component of student motivation has to do with students’ self-beliefs—for example, whether students believe that their intelligence is fixed or malleable. Students who hold the latter view tend to pursue challenges and are more resilient in the face of setbacks. Those students who view intelligence as being fixed tend to pursue easy successes and are more vulnerable in the face of setbacks. Pajares and Schunk (2002, p. 18) assert, ",21,mtms2010-02-354a,,
"It may even be reasonably argued that teachers should pay as much attention to students’ self-beliefs as to actual competence, for it is the belief that may more accurately predict students’ motivation and future academic choices. ",22,mtms2010-02-354a,,
"Peer acceptance and influence are of increasing importance in determining students’ self-efficacy during early adolescence. Students’ sense of belonging in the mathematics classroom can significantly affect whether—and the degree to which— they choose to engage in their own learning. Yet students’ sense of belonging in the academic community is complicated by the fact that within the culture of the typical U.S. high school, a student’s immediate social concerns often have far more motivational power than that student’s academic concerns. In many students’ eyes, activity in these two dimensions (academic and social) is not only separate but can actually be contradictory—that is, students may see success in the academic arena going hand-in-hand with failure in the social arena.  easing stUdents’ tRansition to high school",23,mtms2010-02-354a,,
There are a number of ways we can guide students to help overcome these transition-to-high-school challenges. We can— 1.  improve instructional alignment through collaboration between middle and high school teachers; 2.  address mathematics content challenges using structured professional learning communities; and  3.  shape classroom culture to address some of the social and psychological factors that students face. ,24,mtms2010-02-354a,,
Suggested Practice: Greater Alignment through Collaboration,25,mtms2010-02-354a,,
"What can teachers and other educators do to promote a greater degree of success for their students making the transition to high school? A first step can be to collaborate on issues that relate to this transition. Too often, teachers work in isolation, each trying to solve problems alone without a systematic and coordinated effort. DuFour and his colleagues illuminate a growing consensus among education leaders that this isolation must end. They advocate the use of collaboration as a communication, articulation, and problem-solving tool (DuFour, Eaker, and DuFour 2005). ",26,mtms2010-02-354a,,
"However, this kind of collaborative, in-depth work, especially when it is used to deal with a transition involving multiple schools, requires genuine cross-campus collaboration among mathematics faculty, not just conversations among district leaders. Middle and high school teachers need opportunities to discuss transition issues, collaboratively study and understand their state mathematics standards, and work together to better prepare students for success in learning to use increasingly abstract notations and representations. This collaboration can only occur when colleagues work together to develop common understandings about carefully aligned and developmentally appropriate resources and effective instructional strategies. ",27,mtms2010-02-354a,,
"In this collaboration, teachers can  clarify what content each is responsible for teaching, how that content is taught, and how it could be assessed. Eighth-grade teachers should be aware of exactly how algebraic reasoning was developed and promoted by the seventh-grade teachers. Their teaching should then connect to those understandings and experiences and know exactly how far to extend them. Likewise, high school teachers need to be able to pick up where the eighth-grade teachers left off so that their teaching can confidently connect to what students have already learned. Such boundary-crossing means that teachers need structures that allow these cross buildings and culture interactions to occur.",28,mtms2010-02-354a,,
"At the student level, the transition  from middle school to high school coursework should feel seamless and well connected. Students should not view high school mathematics as something completely new. It should instead reflect a natural progression of concepts and ideas for which students have been prepared.",29,mtms2010-02-354a,,
"Suggested Practice: Learning Communities Focused on Instruction and Ongoing Assessment A natural extension of collaborative work is to develop more structured professional learning communities to help students transition from middle to high school mathematics. The idea of forming such groups among teachers is certainly not new; done well, however, the process involves far more than simply gathering educators together. An effective professional learning community should address questions such as these:  1.  How should the community  structure work around a particular problem?  2.  What role does each participant  play?  3.  What evidence will be used to measure progress in student outcomes? ",30,mtms2010-02-354a,,
"A number of good models for organizing effective learning communities exist. Of particular note, Driscoll and colleagues at the Education Development Center (EDC) in Massachusetts have been developing resources to help teachers collaboratively study the effective teaching and learning of mathematics. The core belief guiding the EDC work is that good mathematics instruction begins with understanding how mathematics is learned. ",31,mtms2010-02-354a,,
"Their work also emphasizes the use of classroom artifacts (e.g., student work samples; transcripts and video of classroom interactions) to provide common ground for teacher discussion and promote a greater degree of content knowledge in both mathematics and pedagogy. For example, Fostering Algebraic Thinking: A Guide for Teachers, Grades 6−10 (Driscoll 1999) and its companion book The Fostering Algebraic Thinking Toolkit: A Guide for Staff Development (Driscoll et al. 2001) clarify how algebraic “habits of mind” can be promoted across grades 6 to 10. These resources advocate the use of problem-solving scenarios that promote algebraic reasoning as well as offer strategies for finding algebra in unlikely places so that students will not view it as something separate from the rest of mathematics. The notion of teachers forming professional learning communities to address instruction and curriculum alignment holds tremendous promise (Paek 2008).",32,mtms2010-02-354a,,
"Suggested Practice:  Shaping Classroom Culture Several districts and schools have successfully taken on the problems that go beyond transition, such as students’ motivation and self-beliefs. Some  have undertaken modest interventions designed to more actively engage students in doing mathematics and create a stronger academic culture that supports students’ cognitive, social, and motivational development.",33,mtms2010-02-354a,,
"For example, the Academic Youth Development (AYD) program seeks to create a positive culture for learning high school mathematics by shaping the existing classroom culture using ideas from the fields of cognitive science, neuroscience, and educational psychology. (The AYD program was created by the Charles A. Dana Center at the University of Texas at Austin in collaboration with Agile Mind.) This program engages students in discussions and activities that teach them how people learn, how to overcome obstacles to learning, and how to create a community of learners through mutual accountability. These youth development or  psychological strategies are taught in parallel to a component focusing on ratio and proportional reasoning and on multiple representations of relationships and problem solving. AYD supports incoming ninth-grade algebra students by engaging them in a summer bridge class before their algebra course, which focuses on all these elements and then reinforces them by strategically timed schoolyear experiences. The AYD program aims to teach students how to think and reason mathematically. It also works to shape the ways that students think about themselves as learners, develop their commitment to high achievement, and create a set of social supports that sustain their responsible and productive engagement in challenging courses.",34,mtms2010-02-354a,,
"One of the most important lessons learned from this program is that students’ mathematical learning and high school success can improve greatly when they realize that their intelligence is malleable, not fixed. This  suggests that we can ease students’ transition from middle school to high school math by incorporating into the teaching of math these various potent ideas from social psychology: 1.  Effective effort 2.  Attribution of effort 3.  The significance of interpersonal  skills 4.  A sense of belonging 5.  Motivation",35,mtms2010-02-354a,,
"It can be powerful to draw on neuroscience to show students how their brains actually change as they learn new things. As mathematics teachers, we may limit our effectiveness if we focus only on mathematics without taking into account the psychological factors that are so critical to student success—especially for students at such a tumultuous stage of their lives.

"If we want to improve students’ transition from middle school to high school mathematics, we need to meet with colleagues and consider ways to work together on this problem—both on and across campuses. The alignment of both instruction and curricula is critical. But what we teach and how we teach it are the most important factors within the control of teachers. Toward that end, we conclude with the following recommendations:  •	 Commit	to	forming	a	professional	 learning community around the issue of transitioning between schools and approaches to mathematics and request the support needed to progress toward improvement. •	 As	a	learning	community,	determine how you will know that you are making progress and hold yourselves accountable.",41,mtms2010-02-354a,,

"Students always face a challenge as they shift from one level to the next. But we, as teachers, can greatly increase the likelihood that students will successfully meet this challenge and experience success in high school mathematics.",43,mtms2010-02-354a,,
