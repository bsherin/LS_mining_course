"mMrs. Cole has been teaching sixth- and seventh-grade mathematics  for seventeen years and is respected by her colleagues. She excels at helping students achieve benchmarks and prepare for more advanced work. She has always worked hard to respond to her students’ needs, usually teaching classes that are designated at particular levels relative to students’ readiness and prior achievement. In recent years, her school has been moving toward more heterogeneous grouping of students. Mrs. Cole and her colleagues are facing an increasingly diverse range of readiness within each individual class. In planning each day’s lesson, she strives to find ways to make the learning tasks respectful, accessible, and challenging for all her students without creating multiple lessons that occur simultaneously.

Being Mindful of indiVidual differences,4,mtms2009-08-34a,,
"Differentiated instruction requires that teachers pay attention to many differences among students, including their varied interests, learning styles, and ability and achievement levels. When responding to readiness, in particular, teachers must ask themselves many questions about the challenge levels of the learning tasks: 1.  What makes a mathematics task  easy or hard, and for whom?  2.  How can we best provide support  for students who are struggling while challenging those who are more advanced?  3.  How can teachers integrate effective differentiation despite limited planning time? ",5,mtms2009-08-34a,,
"This article grew out of a study that  explored how the challenge level of learning tasks is connected to behavior for students who show strong potential in mathematics but are frequently off task (Simonsen, Little, and Fairbanks 2008). The idea is that when given appropriately challenging tasks, students may be more engaged and less likely to be off task or disruptive. ",6,mtms2009-08-34a,,
"During the study, which was  conducted in sixth- and eighth-grade mathematics classes, teachers gave us their planned independent practice activities for each day. Starting from these problem sets, we created sets of “hard tasks” and “easy tasks” and observed students at work. An important outcome of this process was extensive conversation about what defined a task as “hard” or “easy” and how this work related to the work of a teacher trying to provide differentiated instruction. Differentiated instruction grows from the recognition that students learn at different paces and find challenge and stimulation in different types of tasks. Teachers using differentiated instruction hold high expec-",7,mtms2009-08-34a,,

"tations for all students, using ongoing assessment to guide instructional decision making. They begin with worthwhile objectives and strong curricular materials, then use evidence of students’ needs to provide a variety of learning experiences. Through these experiences, the hope is that students develop understanding and can demonstrate what they have learned. ",9,mtms2009-08-34a,,
"Sometimes this variety is designed to appeal to students’ interests, respond to their diverse learning preferences and profiles, and ensure challenge for their varied readiness levels. Often, of course, activities might respond to more than one area of student difference. For example, a teacher might present a task that allows students to choose from a menu of topics and a list of product formats; or a teacher might distribute two versions of a task, at different levels of complexity, but then allow students within each task group to choose whether to work independently or with a partner. In each case, the objectives and tasks for all students should reflect best practices in the content area. However, differentiated tasks should allow students to engage with learning in ways that best meet their own needs.",10,mtms2009-08-34a,,
"Differentiation relies on flexible grouping, clear expectations, and a shared understanding that different  students might be doing different things at the same time. In a mathematics classroom, whole-class instruction might be followed by independent practice using problem sets that are at different levels of complexity. Or a teacher might begin by distributing varied problem sets and then spend the class rotating from one small group to another to provide targeted instruction. These groups change from day to day and unit to unit, according to student needs and interests, as demonstrated through ongoing assessment.  using tiering as a strategy",11,mtms2009-08-34a,,
"A number of strategies can be used to streamline planning for differentiation and integrating it into instructional practice. Designing learning and interest centers, using anchor activities, producing menus of options to allow for student choice, and establishing learning contracts with individual students are just a few approaches.",12,mtms2009-08-34a,,
"One important strategy for differentiation is tiering. It involves preparing multiple tasks or versions of tasks that respond to common objectives while providing variety in their levels of complexity and challenge, the learning styles they address, or the interests to which they appeal (Heacox 2002; Pierce and Adams 2005). ",13,mtms2009-08-34a,,
"Often, tiering is used to refer to  tasks that are differentiated to respond to differing levels of readiness, with a focus on the level of challenge presented by the tasks (Tomlinson 2003). Through tiering, mathematics teachers can give all students challenging tasks while ensuring sufficient scaffolding for struggling students and reducing repetition for more advanced students. ",14,mtms2009-08-34a,,
"Although tiering for readiness  involves adjusting tasks to fit students’ varying ability levels, it is done with an eye to ensuring that all students are presented with respectful and worthwhile mathematical tasks. Such tasks  offer students opportunities to draw on their past experiences, use significant mathematics, and understand and make connections across mathematical ideas (Carpenter et al. 1997; NCTM 2000). ",15,mtms2009-08-34a,,
"The degree to which the tasks are respectful for individual students and groups of students depends on the adjustments made for student readiness. One key principle of a differentiated classroom is that students have a right to “ ‘begin where they are’ and to expect to grow as learners” (Tomlinson 2001, p. 93). Therefore, although a teacher’s initial development or selection of a worthwhile task is grounded in representing important mathematical skills and ideas, the adjustments depend on recognizing student areas of strength and need through ongoing assessment. ",16,mtms2009-08-34a,,
"Tiering for readiness begins with selecting or developing a worthwhile learning task that will help students achieve one or more meaningful objectives. Then a teacher develops several adjusted versions of the task, with the same or similar objectives, based on students’ assessed needs (Tomlinson 2003). For example, some students may need assignments that have more complexity or abstraction; others might need more concrete tasks. Developing the tiers may involve constructing new problems or carefully selecting and distributing existing problems. By selecting or designing tiers around the same core mathematical ideas and processes and by starting from a worthwhile task, teachers can also then assess all students’ progress toward the core objectives. ",17,mtms2009-08-34a,,
"It is critical in this context to  recognize key distinctions between assessment and grading. Tiering depends on assessment, because it requires gathering information about student progress to make instructional decisions. Performance on a pre- assessment or an in-class activity one day will help a teacher decide which level of a tiered assignment a student ",18,mtms2009-08-34a,,

"should receive the next day. A student who is struggling with a concept during a whole-class discussion—or finding it not very challenging—may be assigned to a particular tier for that day on the basis of the informal assessment of discussion participation. Although these instructional decisions often result in tasks that vary in overall expectation from one student to another, in a well-designed tiered assignment all students will be working toward the same objectives at levels that are respectful of their individual needs. The experience will also allow students to grow in their learning. ",20,mtms2009-08-34a,,
"Grading, on the other hand, represents a reporting of student achievement, usually at an end point. Literature on differentiation strongly supports the development of grading systems that combine attention to achievement of the objectives with a consideration of progress and effort. The literature also supports including these components within reporting systems (e.g., Tomlinson and McTighe 2006; Wormeli 2006). In addition, these authors recommend that not everything students do be graded. ",21,mtms2009-08-34a,,
"Performance on a tiered assignment may be considered as part of  the overall evidence of progress but need not be formally graded except to indicate satisfactory or unsatisfactory progress. A full discussion of grading within a differentiated classroom is not included here, but interested readers are encouraged to look to the references for more information. ",22,mtms2009-08-34a,,
"To establish multiple tiers, a  teacher must consider what characteristics make a task more or less challenging for given learners. Tomlinson (2001, 2003) provides some guidance by suggesting multiple ways of adjusting tasks. She identifies a number of continua that describe learning tasks and explains that differentiation occurs through adjusting where a task falls on one or more of these continua. For example, tasks may be defined on a continuum from concrete to abstract; in a simple example, a given problem may be made more concrete by giving students manipulatives. Tomlinson has compared these different qualities of learning tasks to the adjustable buttons on a stereo. She calls her metaphor the “equalizer” and explains that multiple “buttons” may be adjusted on any given task to create the right “sound” for a given student or group. ",23,mtms2009-08-34a,,
"In the following sections, we explore several of the specific equalizer continua in more detail, with specific problems that illustrate how they might be represented in mathematics tasks at the middle school level.  increasing or decreasing the facets of a task One straightforward way to differentiate tasks is to increase or decrease the number of facets in a problem, thereby adjusting its complexity. Examples of facets that can be adjusted in a mathematics problem include the number of steps required to solve it, the number of variables, or the number of different skills to be employed. ",24,mtms2009-08-34a,,

This is distinctly different from giving students more or fewer total problems. Instead, the focus is on the internal components of the tasks. For those who are struggling to grasp a concept, operation, or application, teachers may decrease facets by reducing the number of steps or other components of a problem that may go beyond the central objective. ",33,mtms2009-08-34a,,
"Consider the sets of problems in  figure 1. Both sets ask students to factor trinomials, but each trinomial in (b) includes a facet that is missing from (a). A teacher could give (a) and (b) to different groups of students; for example, (a) could be assigned to those who might be struggling to grasp the concept. Although teachers would want all their students eventually to complete problems such as those in (b), some students will be ready sooner than others. ",34,mtms2009-08-34a,,
"Observing how students respond to the tasks in (a) will give teachers a basis for assigning further practice problems such as those in the task or for moving a student on to problems like those in (b). A student’s performance on the problems in (b) will help the teacher determine whether he or she needs to try a few practice problems resembling those in (a), continue with problems similar to those in (b), or move on to a new topic or skill. ",35,mtms2009-08-34a,,
"Consider the problem that is in figure 2. To reduce the number of facets, a teacher might present simpler number combinations, such as four values with a mean of 6 or three values with a mean of 7. The key concepts of the problem—finding mean values and recognizing that different data sets can produce the same mean—remain the same, but students are asked to grapple with fewer different values and thus fewer possible distractions from the key concepts. ",36,mtms2009-08-34a,,
"As an alternative, teachers may choose to provide extra scaffolding on a problem, adding guidance to the steps or components involved. This approach does not directly decrease the number of facets; rather, it limits the number of facets a student has to handle at a time. For example, the trinomial problem set (b) in figure 1 might be adjusted by adding the direction to check for a common factor.  ",37,mtms2009-08-34a,,
"For more advanced learners, adjusting the number of facets might involve adding extra steps or variables or requiring a greater range of skills. The problem in figure 3 could be adjusted for more advanced students as follows: ",38,mtms2009-08-34a,,
"The mean, median, and mode of the individual data values are 32, 34, and 44 but not necessarily in that order. Which value is the mean? Which is the median? Which is the mode? How are you able to determine this? ",39,mtms2009-08-34a,,
"This information increases complexity by asking students to consider more variables at one time. Advanced learners often need only a few practice problems to master an objective. Therefore, adding more facets through extension questions can provide an appropriate challenge, as in this question that extends figure 2: fig. 4 Two degrees of reasoning with algebraic tasks (a) Factor each expression.",40,mtms2009-08-34a,,

As students move from concrete numbers into variables, a higher level of abstraction is introduced. In the more advanced courses of algebra, geometry, and trigonometry in high school, teachers present material that is naturally more abstract than much of what students have previously experienced. Thus, it is helpful for middle school students to grapple with problems that introduce increasing layers that balance concreteness and abstraction adjusted for student readiness. ",42,mtms2009-08-34a,,
"Explaining reasoning, making connections, and exploring predictions are important mathematical skills for algebra and beyond, but these skills need to be fostered much earlier and particularly reinforced in middle school. For example, consider  the following extension for the task presented in figure 2: ",43,mtms2009-08-34a,,
"If the mean number of movies watched in a week is 8, and if every girl watches a different number of movies, what is the smallest possible range for the set of six values? Explain your answer.",44,mtms2009-08-34a,,
"This problem adds a level of reasoning and connection. Although the original question asks students to explore the basic concept of mean, this problem adds a level of abstraction because there is not one clearly specified way to approach the problem. Students also have to think abstractly about the number set in the problem and be able to explain their thinking. ",45,mtms2009-08-34a,,

Consider the sets of tasks in figure 4. The problems in (b) increase abstraction by including items that cannot be factored. Only the first expression is actually factorable into binomials, although the third expression has 4 as a common factor. Students’ responses to the second and third items would be important indications of their understanding of the concepts, based on the degree to which they can explain why they cannot be factored. ",51,mtms2009-08-34a,,
"On the third item, a student could provide a correct response with just 4 as a common factor; another student might add an explanation as to why the expression cannot be factored further into binomials. This response demonstrates more thoughtful reasoning; it would give teachers evidence for determining if the student needed more practice on similar problems or encouragement to explain additional thinking on this task. The response would also tell the teacher if the student was ready to move on. ",52,mtms2009-08-34a,,

"standing of the concepts and communicate reasoning, moving them toward the more advanced skills of proof. At the middle school level, it is more appropriate to use reasoning rather than formal proof (Gray et al. 1999). All students should be asked to demonstrate their reasoning in mathematics. However, by increasing the emphasis on reasoning, a teacher may also increase the abstraction required by the task for more advanced students.  expanding proBleMs",55,mtms2009-08-34a,,
"Another way to differentiate tasks is to adjust the degree to which they ask students to stretch their understanding. In so doing, students will be moving from the foundational skills of a discipline to transformational applications of these skills in new contexts. When students are first presented with a concept or procedure or are having difficulty grasping it, their assigned tasks should be designed to build understanding and establish a strong foundation. Foundational tasks in mathematics typically present material in a similar context to how it was taught and require practice of basic skills. For example, the following problem presents a straightforward equation: ",56,mtms2009-08-34a,,
Solve for x: 320 = x(x − 4),57,mtms2009-08-34a,,
"As students develop greater understanding of a concept, they may be ready to use what they have learned in a different context to find new connections or think about the concept in a new way, which in its entirety can be regarded as transformational thinking. For example, students might be given a task such as that in figure 5. ",58,mtms2009-08-34a,,
This task is more transformational because it asks students to make connections and put the equation together themselves. It often requires students to apply concepts and skills to real-life contexts and problems in ways that they have not been explicitly taught. The following task moves the problem still further along the continuum toward transformational: ,59,mtms2009-08-34a,,
"You are putting a new in-ground pool in your yard. The area of the pool is 320 m2, and the pool is  4 m longer than it is wide. You want to put a patio 2 m wide all the way around the pool. What will be the total area of your patio? ",60,mtms2009-08-34a,,

"Transformational tasks ask students to demonstrate a more thorough understanding of key concepts. For example, the statistics problem in figure 2 is transformational in that it requires a greater understanding of the mean than a problem presenting individual data points. ",62,mtms2009-08-34a,,
