Number Golf peared in the October 2006 issue of this journal:  tThe following “Solve It” task ap-,2,mtms2007-12-284a,,
"Write a mathematical expression  for each number 1 through 18, inclusive, using only the symbol 4 in your expression. The goal is to use the fewest number of 4s as possible. No other digit can be used. Two examples are 4! – 4 = 20 and 44/(14) = 22. (Fours can be combined to create 44, 4.4, 444, .4 and so on.)  ematical thinking. Students could even revisit this task to improve their “scores.” For example, students used three 4s to represent 5 when they could have used two 4s: 14 ÷ 0.4.",3,mtms2007-12-284a,,
There are several ways to vary the ,4,mtms2007-12-284a,,
"Number Golf task: •  Ask students to use a fixed number  of a given value, such as five 3s or four 4s.  •  List the requirement that each expression consist of only prime numbers.  •  Go beyond representing 18 values  and have students represent all integers 1 to 100 using the fewest numbers of 4s.  •  List the numbers 1 to 100 around the classroom. Have students place their solutions under the corresponding number. Throughout the year as students continue working with numbers and operations, they can fill in expressions that are not represented or replace an expression with five 4s with one that uses three 4s.

"This department shares the thinking of middle school students as they explore and communicate mathematics. It highlights students’ work, including projects, investigations, or creative solutions to the problems in the monthly “Solve It!” department. Original student work is included along with sufficient information about the activity so that readers can try the ideas with their students. Please send manuscripts to the editor, edward Mooney, Illinois State University, Campus Box 4520, Normal, IL 61790-4520, or by e-mail to mooney@ilstu.edu. Published solutions will be credited.

"The students of Diane Innerst at Harrisburg Academy in Wormleysburg, Pennsylvania, and those of José Francisco Sala García at Instituto de Educación Secundaria Sa Colomina in Ibiza, Balearic Islands, Spain, submitted a variety of expressions using the symbol 4 to represent the values 1 through 18. Figure 1 shows a composite of the student expressions that use the fewest number of 4s to represent each value. Overall, they used forty-nine 4s to represent the values 1 through 18.",13,mtms2007-12-284a,,
