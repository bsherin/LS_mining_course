"When students use manipulatives, teachers can take advantage of their surprising solutions to engage the class in rich and productive mathematical discussions.  mMore than forty years ago, Jerome Bruner developed a theory about the use of  physical models or manipulatives when teaching math. He argued that students would learn mathematics better if they first encountered concepts and procedures by actively modeling them with manipulatives (1966). ",3,mtms2009-10-148a,,
"Susan b. taber enactiVe, iconic, and sYMBolic KnoWledge",4,mtms2009-10-148a,,
"Bruner’s theory described three kinds of knowledge: enactive, iconic, and symbolic. When students represent quantities to be added with base ten blocks and perform the actions of adding the blocks and trading ten ones for one ten block, they are using enactive knowledge. Textbook illustrations of base ten blocks representing the addends and sum of a problem are iconic representations. Such representations should help students recall the actions of adding the base ten blocks and making necessary trades. When students write numerals and operation signs to represent addition, they are using symbolic knowledge. Today most elementary mathematics textbooks include illustrations of base ten blocks to represent procedures for adding numbers. ",5,mtms2009-10-148a,,
"Bruner’s theory assumes that there is a close correspondence among the   actions the students perform using the manipulatives, the illustrations, and the symbolic representations. For example, when students physically add the ones blocks and make any necessary trades, their actions using the blocks match the symbols used to represent the standard algorithm. When students are given manipulatives and asked to represent numbers and operations, teachers know that students frequently represent the mathematical operation in ways other than how the teacher expects or the textbook prescribes. This holds true for elementary school students and preservice teachers. Many of the ways that students represent quantities or model the action of the problem do not correspond to the steps of the procedure or algorithm that is being taught. For example, suppose students are asked to represent the problem 237 + 383 with base ten blocks, combine the blocks, and find the sum. Figure 1 shows and describes some of the ways that the correct sum of 620 was found. ",6,mtms2009-10-148a,,
"Diverse solutions would seem to suggest that the link between manipula- tives and the written procedure has become unclear. A teacher might want to ask students who follow the traditional standard algorithm of adding ones, then tens, and then hundreds to describe how they solved the problem as a way to avoid confusing other students. Alternatively, he or she might decide that the lesson would be clearer if the students were directed to model each step of the standard  algorithm with blocks while recording the steps with symbols. Another option would be for the teacher to demonstrate the standard algorithm using the blocks and show students how the actions of combining the blocks and making trades correspond to the standard written algorithm. Any one of these three options  might seem to be an easier and more efficient method for teaching the meaning of the algorithm. However,  these options actually deny students valuable opportunities to make sense of the manipulative model and to make sense of the concepts that they are meant to represent. ",7,mtms2009-10-148a,,
"If, instead, the teacher invites various students to describe and explain the differing ways they combined the blocks to represent adding the two numbers, the students will, out of necessity, explain that they added the hundreds to the hundreds, the tens ",8,mtms2009-10-148a,,

"I introduced the “How Many Were Eaten?” problem (Burns 2000) into a sixth-grade classroom. This school tracked students for mathematics by ability; the students in this class were the lowest achieving group. I had collected candy boxes, greeting card boxes, and file folder boxes in various sizes. Each box contained 7 cubes. ",17,mtms2009-10-148a,,
I asked students to pretend that the cubes represented candies. They were to figure out how many “candies” had been eaten from their boxes. ,18,mtms2009-10-148a,,
"As I walked around the room, I observed students using a variety of methods to find the number of candies that the box could hold when full. Some students found the number in each row and the number of rows and then added. Others multiplied the number in each row by the number of rows. Calculators and paper and pencil were used. Two girls were outlining the cubes along the bottom of the box. (See fig. 2.) When I paused by their desk, one said, “It’s going to take us a long time to draw all the candies.” Not wanting to solve the problem for them, I asked, “Can you think of a quicker way to find out how many there are? How many are in the first row?” (All names used below are pseudonyms.)",19,mtms2009-10-148a,,

"After each pair of students had solved the problem for at least one box, I led a class discussion about their solutions. I asked the students who had worked with a particular box to explain how they had found the number of candies that had been eaten. Students described repeatedly adding the number in each row or multiplying the number in each row by the number of rows and then subtracting 7.

Paul and Tammy’s solution for another box posed a difficult teaching dilemma. ,42,mtms2009-10-148a,,
"Paul: We measured with the cubes and found the area. There were  9 1/2 cubes this way and 6 1/2 this way, so we multiplied and got  54 1/2 for the area. Then there were four layers, so we multiplied 54 1/2 by 4 to get 216 1/2. When we subtracted the 7 that were in the box, that meant 209 1/2 were eaten.",43,mtms2009-10-148a,,
I was unsure about discussing  the computational error in Paul and Tammy’s solution so decided to see what other students thought about it. I hoped that someone would give a better estimate of the product of  9 1/2 × 6 1/2. Jamal was the first to respond when I asked for questions. ,44,mtms2009-10-148a,,
Jamal: I don’t think you should  multiply 9 1/2 by 6 1/2 because it was a new box of candy. There wouldn’t be half pieces in it. You should multiply 9 × 6.,45,mtms2009-10-148a,,
"When I asked the class to comment on this response, several students agreed that only whole candies would be in the box. I decided to follow-up on Jamal’s statement to discuss the difference between the mathematics of discrete quantities (whole candies) and continuous quantities. ",46,mtms2009-10-148a,,

"At the end of the discussion, I  collected the students’ written solutions. Annie and Dorinda’s paper supported their discovery that 10 were in each of the 10 rows (see fig. 3). It did not include their attempts to draw and count each candy or to indicate whether they multiplied or used repeated addition to reach 100.

As a teacher, I developed a greater level of trust in both the usefulness of the representation and the power of students’ thinking. Jamal’s statement about whole candies versus fractional candies reminded me and the rest of the class of the problem context.

"Textbooks often represent fractions as circular or rectangular regions to illustrate concepts such as equivalency and algorithms for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of fractions. When I was in elementary school, we used cardboard patterns to trace circles on construction paper and then divided our circles into halves, fourths, thirds, sixths, and eighths, and cut them out. My fifth-grade teacher, Mrs. McDermaid, encouraged us to use our fraction-circle pieces to illustrate the equivalent fractions that we generated using the computational procedure of multiplying the numerator and denominator by the same number. We could see that 4/6 was equivalent to 2/3 by placing the 4/6 on top of the 2/3.
