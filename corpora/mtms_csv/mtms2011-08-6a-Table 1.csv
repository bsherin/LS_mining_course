"As we begin this new volume year, I am excited to begin my tenure as the chair of the MTMS Editorial Panel. In May 2011, I had the privilege of attending the NCTM Annual Leadership Summit and was amazed by the tremendous work of the members of the Board of Directors, the chairs of other committees, and the staff at NCTM—all on behalf of teachers. A true spirit of teamwork and a contagious enthusiasm for the art of teaching mathematics were much in ",18,mtms2011-08-6a,,

"Another way to be heard is to  write for MTMS. If you have a good idea, share it with our readership. If you have a stance or viewpoint on a hot topic in mathematics education, submit it to On My Mind. If you try one of the Solve It! problems or Mathematical Explorations activities in your classroom, let us know how it worked out. If you enjoy assigning the Cartoon Corner activity, become a classroom field-tester for this department. If a feature article made a difference in your teaching, let us know that, as well.",22,mtms2011-08-6a,,
