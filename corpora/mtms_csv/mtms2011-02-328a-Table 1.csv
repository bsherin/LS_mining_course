"Darin Beigie involves the critical leap from working with numbers to thinking with variables. A good example of such a leap is a question I ask my seventh-grade prealgebra students at the beginning of the school year: iInitial exposure to algebraic thinking   If you plant a 10-foot tree that grows 2 feet per year, how tall is the tree after 7 years? After 12 years? After n years?",4,mtms2011-02-328a,,
"Most students are comfortable making the number expressions 10 + 2(7) or 10 + 2(12), but they have varying levels of readiness for creating the algebraic expression 10 + 2n. Some see the abstraction immediately, whereas others may take weeks or months to internalize the idea. The transition to thinking mathematically using variables has many layers, and for all students an abstraction that is clear in one setting may be opaque in another. ",5,mtms2011-02-328a,,
"Some students for whom the 10 + 2n abstraction was easy might balk at constructing the same type of expression later when confronting a linear graph, making a spreadsheet formula, or solving a word problem.",6,mtms2011-02-328a,,
"Geometric counting and the resulting algebraic patterns provide an ideal setting to help students make the abstract leap from numbers to variables. The visual context of a geometry problem plays an integral role in the  discovery of number patterns and algebraic expressions. For example, determining the nth number in the sequence 2, 5, 10, 17, 26, . . . becomes much more manageable when counting the number of unit squares in the sequence of polygons shown in figure 1, in which each number in the sequence is clearly one more than a perfect square. ",7,mtms2011-02-328a,,
"Several good resources for geometric settings leading to algebraic patterns are found in Fulton and Lombard (2001), Phillips (1991), and Schaaf et al. (1983). There has also  been a wealth of recent analysis of visual or figural settings for pattern recognition and construction of algebraic expressions in Friel and Markworth (2009); Billings, Tiedt, and Slater (2007); Rivera (2007); Smith, Hillen, and Catania (2007); Lee and Freiman (2006); and Rivera and Becker (2005).

In my prealgebra course, I incorporate geometric pattern problems in which the geometry and algebra hold more of an equal partnership; the geometry setting is vital, and the geometric and algebraic understandings reinforce each other and offer new perspectives. Students are introduced to surface area and volume as a geometric counting problem before they study more conventional methods. A variety of geometric topics, such as interior angle relationships and polyhedron classification, are studied as pattern problems to discover algebraic formulas.",12,mtms2011-02-328a,,
"This article highlights some of the geometric counting problems I use in my prealgebra curriculum. Situations are emphasized in which the patterns lead to rich perspectives in both geometric and algebraic thinking. Within the concrete (three-dimensional) and pictorial (two-dimensional) geometric settings, students are able to instinctively handle algebraic manipulations that are usually reserved for more abstract courses. Geometric measurement that uses counting can help students discover basic geometric formulas as they recognize patterns. ",13,mtms2011-02-328a,,

"I assign the cube problem in figure 2  early in the school year, before any volume or surface area studies, to impress on students that geometric measurement is ultimately about counting line segments, squares, and cubes. Students work in small groups to build larger cubes from unit cubes and actively solve the problem; I help them only when needed. Filling in columns 1 × 1 × 1 through 4 × 4 × 4 is generally straightforward. However, some students have trouble counting 12 edges per cube, and some get lost when counting the total number of squares on the cube’s surface. ",22,mtms2011-02-328a,,
"Most students quickly move from counting to seeing number patterns, such as that the 4 × 4 × 4 cube has a surface area of 6 • 16 = 96 square units because there are 6 faces and each face has 4 • 4 = 16 square units.

"The verbal repetition often helps students see, without any further explanation, that to go from edge length to face perimeter they multiply by 4 (because a face has 4 edges). Hence, they find that the solution is 4n units for the n × n × n column. When students see the leap into algebra, the “Aha!” moment is clear on their faces. Their transition from numbers to variables represents a significant step in becoming an algebraic thinker. Once the abstraction is made, the understanding of the number patterns quickly translates into the correct algebraic expressions.",33,mtms2011-02-328a,,
"When algebraic expressions are used, the geometric problem offers a concrete or pictorial setting so that students can evaluate expressions and solve elementary equations. Students can determine the surface area of a 10 × 10 × 10 cube by substituting 10 for n for the expression 6n2, giving 6(10)2 = 6(100) = 600 square units. Note how order-of-operations issues, such as squaring n but not 6 in 6n2, are supported by the geometry of the problem: Multiplying by 6 comes from the six faces of the cube, so it is clear not to square the 6. ",34,mtms2011-02-328a,,
"Students determine what edge length corresponds to a total edge length of 216 units by solving the equation 12n = 216. They also determine what edge length corresponds to a surface area of 1350 square units by solving the equation 6n2 = 1350. Within the geometric setting, most students instinctively know to solve for n in the surface area problem by dividing each side of the equation by 6 (to get the number of squares per face) and then taking the square root (to get the length of the square’s edge).

"More traditional studies follow later in the year, such as using nets to approach surface area, but students have discovered basic geometric formulas through pattern recognition while building with manipulatives.

"Students can investigate the number of faces, vertices, and edges for prisms and pyramids using physical shapes (see  fig. 4). As before, geometric counting quickly evolves into recognizing number patterns. Students do not need to count out the 12 vertices in the hexagonal prism, because they recognize that 2 sets of 6 vertices are found in a prism with a hexagonal base. With prior exposure to geometric patterns, many students are comfortable making algebraic expressions for a base of n-sided polygons. For some students, however, the “Aha!” moment from earlier pattern problems does not easily carry over, although I give them the same cues. For the number of prism faces, I ask,  •  If the base has 5 sides, how many  faces does the prism have?  •  How many faces if the base has 6  sides?  •  If it has 10 sides? •  If it has n sides? ",46,mtms2011-02-328a,,
"The verbal repetition prompts the students to recognize that they are simply adding 2 each time to the number of sides, so a prism with an n-sided base has n + 2 faces.",47,mtms2011-02-328a,,
"When algebraic expressions are  then used to solve problems, the geometry and algebra are interwoven. Students are asked this follow-up question: “If a prism has 45 edges, how many sides does its base have?” With a completed table in hand, students make and solve the equation 3n = 45 to find that the prism base has 15 sides. Students are not expected to memorize the chart but to use geometric reasoning and visualization to draw on any needed algebraic expressions. Rather than memorize as an isolated fact in the table that a prism with an n-sided base has 3n edges, students should visualize that a  prism has n edges on the bottom base, n edges on the top base, and n edges joining the two bases, or 3n edges.  interior angle patterns",48,mtms2011-02-328a,,
"Motivated by the question of why honeycombs are in the shape of regular hexagons, students study the interior angles of polygons to then determine which regular polygons are candidates for tessellations. The standard approach is to divide the polygon into an appropriate number of triangles using diagonals emanating from any one vertex. Students can consider a pentagon, which can be divided into three triangles; hence, the degree sum of the interior angles in a pentagon is 3 • 180° = 540°. Since in a regular pentagon the 540 degree sum is spread equally across fi ve interior angles, the size of any one interior angle is 540° ÷ 5 = 108°. The pattern study for the angles is constructed much like the polyhedron problem, as shown in table 1. ",49,mtms2011-02-328a,,
Students have discovered basic  geometric  formulas through pattern recognition while building with  manipulatives.,50,mtms2011-02-328a,,
"It is important for students to  recognize that there are always two fewer triangles inside the regular polygon than the number of polygonal sides n, giving a degree sum of interior angles (n – 2)180° that is spread equally across n angles. Therefore, they will see an interior angle of (n – 2)180° ÷ n. I especially like this pattern problem because students experience a sophisticated geometric formula that is built piecewise from  the individual columns of table 1.",51,mtms2011-02-328a,,
The formula is the launching point  for many algebraic investigations. Students not only evaluate the interior angle formula for specifi c values of n but also solve for n from given information. The following would be a typical test question:   How many sides are in a polygon whose interior angle measures add to 2160 degrees?,52,mtms2011-02-328a,,
"Students need to solve the equation (n – 2)180° = 2160° by dividing each side of the equation by 180° and then adding 2. No formal algebraic steps are required, but students need to show their work and explain their thinking. An interesting result is that the majority of students know to divide each side of the equation by 180 degrees, but then some students either subtract 2 instead of adding 2 or forget about the 2 altogether.

"A linear pattern involving perimeter is shown pictorially in figure 5. A common response is to see a number sequence that starts at 6 and goes up by 4 each time. For n hexagons, the perimeter would appear to be 6 + 4n units. However, the sequence starts with one hexagon, rather than zero hexagons, so the 6 in the algebraic expression is incorrect. To point this out to students, I ask them to evaluate their expression for n = 1. One way to correct the mistake is to run the pattern back to 0 hexagons, which would mean subtracting 4 from 6 + 4n to get 2 + 4n units. Another approach is to apply guess and check to determine the proper constant to be added to the 4n term. ",59,mtms2011-02-328a,,
"Figure 6 shows nonlinear patterns; geometry plays an essential role in their discovery. Algebraic expressions are not created from the number sequence alone but rather from generalization based on the underlying geometry.

It is crucial to appreciate that these connections from geometric shapes to algebraic terms are based heavily on the number patterns discovered by students in the counting process. As students count their way through the problem, they recognize that the region represented by the shaded square contributes 4 • 4 squares for stage 4;  5 • 5 squares for stage 5; and so on, ",60,mtms2011-02-328a,,
