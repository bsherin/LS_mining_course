53,What Percent Is Above Average?,"SOLUTIONS 1. a.   Dilbert’s manager made a mathematical error by subtracting 76% from 100% and obtaining 36%. The correct difference is 26%. He also made an error in reasoning: It is unlikely that the other 26% of the managers surveyed “don’t know that they are above average.” More likely, they do not believe that they are above average.    h.  False. There are as many scores in the bottom 25% as in the top 25%. (The spread of the scores in the bottom 25% is greater, but not the number of scores.) i. True 3. a.  Mean: 79.25; median: 85   ([86 + 84]/2); mode: 95    b.  Mean: 83.16 to the nearest     b.  Sample answer: The entire  hundredth; median: 86; mode 95 population of managers is 100%; it makes no sense to talk about 110% of a population. On the basis of his manager’s incorrect arithmetic, Dilbert used the number 110%. But (even) suggesting that all managers are  in the top 100% is no compliment. It just means they are all part  of the population of managers— without regard to being above or below average.

57,What Percent Is Above Average?,"The conversation between Dilbert and his manager was quite comical, and my sixth-grade prealgebra students enjoyed the sarcasm! Percentiles and the interquartile range were new concepts in September for my students, and I used this cartoon activity as an opportunity to expose them to the concepts. I referenced their standardized test scores, which are reported as a box-and-whisker plot. Then I modeled a few conditions in which the interquartile range was large and then small, as well as a variation in whisker length. At that point, we discussed question 2 and voted true or false using whiteboards. Parts (c) and (d) were the most confusing, probably because I introduced box and whiskers and they were looking at quartiles. We reviewed the definition of percentile to clear up misconceptions. When we continued our data unit in January, we revisited Dilbert.",57,What Percent Is Above Average?
