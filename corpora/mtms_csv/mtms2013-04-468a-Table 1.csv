DADDY’S HOME by Tony Rubino and Gary Markstein,1,mtms2013-04-468a,,
Name ______________________________ 4. Would the results for question 3 be  c.  How does Dad’s rate (boards per  minute) compare with the slowest competitor in question 3?,2,mtms2013-04-468a,,
CHALLENGE 6. Another event at the Everyday ,3,mtms2013-04-468a,,
Olympics is planning a rectangular dog pen. The goal is to design a dog pen with the largest area using 144 boards that are each 6 inches wide. What are the dimensions of all the possible rectangular dog pens that could be made with the 144 vertical boards (without cutting any boards)? Which pen will provide the greatest area in which a dog can play?,4,mtms2013-04-468a,,
"OLYMPIC (PICKET) FENCING 1. What is wrong with the fence that  the Dad is building?  2. In one Everyday Olympics event,  competitors nail vertical boards for a picket fence around a rectangular yard. The yard is 12 ft. × 21 ft.    a.  If each vertical board is 6 inches wide, how many vertical boards will each competitor need?   b.  If each vertical board is 4 inches wide, how many vertical boards will each competitor need? 3. Three people compete in the ﬁ nals  of the event in question 2b:  •  Shawn, who can nail 4 boards  every 3 minutes.",5,mtms2013-04-468a,,
"different if the boards were a different width, say, 3 inches wide or 6 inches wide? Why, or why not? 5. The Dad decides to train for next year’s Everyday Olympics using boards that are 4 inches wide. Suppose the 8 vertical boards nailed in place in the cartoon represent 4/25 of the total number of vertical boards he will use. It took him 12 minutes to nail those 8 boards.",6,mtms2013-04-468a,,
"  a.  How many more vertical boards does he need to nail into place?   •  Marti, who can nail 5 boards    b.  How long will it take him to nail  every 4 minutes.    •  Maija, who can nail 7 boards  every 5 minutes.    Who will win the gold medal? The  silver medal? The bronze medal? all the boards? from the April 2013 issue of",7,mtms2013-04-468a,,

"SOLUTIONS 1.  Without any horizontal boards  or posts, the fence will not stay in place very long. It is not clear what the Dad is actually nailing.    So 7x = 5(198) = 990; x =990/7, or about 141.43 minutes. Maija will win the gold, Shawn will win the silver, and Marti will win the bronze.",9,mtms2013-04-468a,,
"2.  Since the rectangle is 12 ft. × 21 ft., the perimeter is 2(12 + 21), or 66 ft.",10,mtms2013-04-468a,,
"a.  Since each board is 6 in. wide, it  takes 2 boards for each foot of fence. Thus, it will take 2(66), or 132 boards.",11,mtms2013-04-468a,,
"  b.  Each board is 1/3 ft. wide. It takes 3 boards for each foot of fence. Thus, it will take 3(66), or 198 boards.",12,mtms2013-04-468a,,
"3.  Each competitor must nail  198 vertical boards. Shawn can nail 4 boards every 3 minutes. Set up a proportion to ﬁ nd how long the 198 boards will take. Let x = number of minutes: 198   So 4x = 3(198) = 594; x = 594/4, or 148.5 minutes. Marti can nail 5 boards every 4 minutes:  198   Therefore, 5x = 4(198) = 792;  x = 792/5, or 158.4 minutes. Maija can nail 7 boards every 5 minutes: 198 4.  Each contender’s rate is determined by dividing the number of boards by the number of minutes. Because each competitor’s rate remains the same, any changes to the size of boards would not affect the outcome of the competition. Although students may compute the exact answers for each case, it is not necessary. Using 4-inch boards, Shawn can nail 4/3, or approximately 1.33, boards per minute; Marti can nail 5/4, or 1.25, boards per minute; and Maija can nail 7/5, or 1.4, boards per minute.",13,mtms2013-04-468a,,
"5.  a.  If 8 boards comprise 4/25 of the fence, then 2 boards are 1/25 of the fence. Then the number of boards needed in all is 25 × 2, or 50. The Dad has already used 8 boards, so he needs to use 50 – 8, or 42 more boards. Another solution: Let x = the total number of boards. Then, (4/25)x = 8. Multiplying both sides of the equation by 25/4 yields x = 50. The number of remaining boards is 50 – 8, or 42.",14,mtms2013-04-468a,,
"b.  If 4/25 of the fence took him 12 minutes, then 1/25 of the fence would take 1/4 of 12 minutes, or 3 minutes. To do the whole fence would take  3 × 25, or 75 minutes. Another solution: Let x = the total number of minutes. Then, (4/25)x = 12. Multiplying both sides of the equation by 25/4 yields x = 75.     (Some students may not notice that part (a) asks about what is remaining to be done, whereas part (b) asks about the entire fence.) c.  The Dad’s rate is 2 boards  every 3 minutes, or 0.666 . . . board per minute. At 5 ÷ 4, or 1.25, boards per minute, Marti is the slowest competitor and his rate is about twice the Dad’s rate.  6.  Since there are 144 of the 6-inchwide boards, the perimeter of the pen will be 72 feet (each board is 1/2 ft. wide). The possible designs include the following:  •  1/2 ft. × 35 1/2 ft. •  1 ft. × 35 ft. •  1 1/2ft. × 34 1/2 ft. •  2 ft. × 34 ft.",15,mtms2013-04-468a,,
" •  17 1/2 ft. × 18 1/2 ft. •  18 ft. × 18 ft.  . . .    The largest rectangular pen will always be the pen that is closest to a square. With this perimeter, the largest area is created with an 18 ft. × 18 ft. square pen.",16,mtms2013-04-468a,,
FIELD-TEST COMMENTS,17,mtms2013-04-468a,,
The cartoon bafﬂ ed a few of my sixthgrade prealgebra students because they were looking for a mathematical problem in question 1. All laughed when they realized that the Dad was  missing horizontal boards to nail into.,18,mtms2013-04-468a,,
"Misconceptions were readily corrected by drawing a diagram for the second question. Once students drew the rectangular yard and reviewed the meaning of perimeter, the solution became obvious. Several students attempted to ﬁ nd the area, and others tried to mix units. A rich discussion followed about the relationship between feet and inches.",19,mtms2013-04-468a,,
"Questions 3 and 4 told me quite  a bit about my students’ problemsolving strategies. One student divided 198 by 4 and then multiplied by 3. Another student converted minutes to seconds to complete the calculations; another calculated the number of boards per minute. One student even calculated minutes per board. We compared the results and realized that minutes per board meant that the fewest minutes referred to the slowest person and the highest number of boards per minute identiﬁ ed the fastest person. Most students identiﬁ ed the least common multiple as 60 and rewrote the fractions with like denominators. They realized that the number of boards cut was not going to affect the outcome for the gold, silver, and bronze based on this information.",20,mtms2013-04-468a,,

"I tried this cartoon activity with my seventh-grade prealgebra class. We had only been in school for two weeks, so some skills were a little rusty; however, this group of students enjoyed the challenging problems.",24,mtms2013-04-468a,,
"I split the class into small groups to  tackle the questions. They were able to easily work through the ﬁ rst three questions. The groups tackled question 3 in a couple of different ways, but all found the correct answer. They either calculated the rate or devised a common denominator for the minutes. Question 5b was challenging for some because they had not done a lot of work with rate problems. I provided some hints to get them started. Although we ran out of time before we could tackle the challenge question, I think with some prompting they could have found the answer.",25,mtms2013-04-468a,,

"I used this activity with my eighthgrade algebra students. It took the entire forty-ﬁ ve-minute class period, and many students were not able to complete the Challenge activity. The students worked in groups of two and three. I had never used the Cartoon Corner with any of my classes before, so this was the ﬁ rst time they had tried this type of problem solving. I was impressed with how diligently they all worked to solve the problems. All the students enjoyed the cartoon and the activity. ",37,mtms2013-04-468a,,

OTHER IDEAS,43,mtms2013-04-468a,,
"If students are interested in the Olympics, design questions based on actual results from events. For example, in the 2012 Olympic pentathlon fencing event, David Svoboda of the Czech Republic won the gold medal. He scored 24 more points than silver medalist Cao Zhongrong of China, and 92 more points than bronze medalist Adam Marosi of Hungary. The sum of the points scored by the three medalists was 17,668. How many points did each medalist score?",44,mtms2013-04-468a,,
