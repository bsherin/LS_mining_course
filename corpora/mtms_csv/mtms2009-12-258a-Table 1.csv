"Active Involvement  for Clear Assessment mMath teachers want to know if students get it when a new mathematics concept has been taught. Because we are not our students’ mind readers, it is difficult to know who does and does not understand. Students often will not admit that they do not understand and are embarrassed to raise their hands when we ask, “Are there any questions?” ",2,mtms2009-12-258a,,
"Therefore, during the course of a lesson, we need a way to assess each student’s understanding to guide the continuation of the lesson. It would be great to find a way to assess student work rapidly and continuously while keeping all students engaged.  record their answers and draw diagrams, tables, graphs, number lines, function tables, or other items. When students finished recording their answers or responses, they could hold them up for the teacher to see. The only problem with this method was that students would have to redraw their diagrams, tables, graphs, number lines, or function tables to set up each response, making it time consuming and tedious.

"Electronic student response systems, such as Qwizdom® by Camcor, H–ITT® from Hyper-Interactive Teaching Tech- nology, Senteo® by Smart Technologies, and TI-Navigator™  by Texas Instruments, are now available. Student responses can be compiled and the data recorded on the teacher’s computer. This allows the teacher and students, if desired, to view each student’s results as well as that of the whole class. Although these electronic response systems can be very effective, they are costly.",4,mtms2009-12-258a,,
"A new type of response device is  similar to slates and white boards, but it has a new twist. The product is a clear plastic pocket-type sleeve, which students and teachers can write on with dry-erase markers. The sleeves are lighter and cleaner than white boards and slates and are much more efficient and flexible. I have been using a plastic sleeve-type device called the ",5,mtms2009-12-258a,,
"One common assessment is to  assign practice work or problems for students to complete. While they work, the teacher circulates to observe each student’s work. This type of assessment is time-consuming and the probability of reaching all students, especially in large classes, is low. Another common assessment is to ask students to respond in unison. However, the problem with this method is that many students will not respond for fear of answering incorrectly.",6,mtms2009-12-258a,,
"Until a few years ago, an effective means of instant assessment was the use of small chalk slates or personalsized dry-erase whiteboards, which could be reused easily by erasing. This method made it easy for students to ",7,mtms2009-12-258a,,

"Communicator® Clearboard, which was developed and marketed by LL Teach. Paper templates of any kind can be inserted into the sleeve and used repeatedly. A diagram, table, graph, number line, function table, or any other graphic can be inserted into the sleeve; students can then write just their answer on the plastic and respond to a question, reusing the template in the sleeve. In a middle school classroom, the students can be filling in function tables one minute and graphing the lines formed by these functions the next. This can be done using one back-to-back sheet; one side is the function table template and the other side is the graphing template. Using only one piece of paper is ecologically responsible.",9,mtms2009-12-258a,,
"Rather than making three or four copies of the same graph axis for the students to graph functions, only one graph is created and slid into the plastic sleeve. It can now be used repeatedly.",10,mtms2009-12-258a,,
This type of device gets every  student actively involved in the lesson and activity. Students enjoy the opportunity to write on something other than paper. I have used this method of response when tutoring one on one. Those students also preferred to solve problems or compute using the Clearboard rather than using paper and pencil. An inexpensive alternative to Clearboards are clear sheets of paper protectors that are available at most office supply stores. They are not as rigid or durable as Clearboards but can be used in the same way.,11,mtms2009-12-258a,,
"When I was a fourth-grade math  teacher, I used templates of clocks, coins, arrays, graphs, grids, hundred charts, number lines, geometric figures, rulers, fraction bars, and many other items. As a middle school math teacher, I use the Clearboards when my students work with function  tables, graphs, angles, triangles,  quadrilaterals, algebra tiles, two- ",12,mtms2009-12-258a,,
"Students generally enjoy writing with markers, especially on a surface other than paper.  dimensional nets for three-dimensional figures, and so on. These are just a few of the many options that are available commercially. Others can be created by the teacher; the ideas are limited only by a teacher’s creativity and ingenuity.  saMple lessons",13,mtms2009-12-258a,,
The following examples illustrate how I have used a Clearboard with a template in my sixth-grade classroom. ,14,mtms2009-12-258a,,
"Immediate Returns I had just completed a lesson on using fraction benchmarks to compare fractions. The students had learned to compare two fractions to 0, 1/2, or 1.  I wrote two fractions on the board, 1/3 and 5/8, to show one fraction that was less than 1/2 and one that was greater than 1/2. A paper number-line template was inserted in the Communicator Clearboard, and students were able to mark and add fraction labels where each of the fractions would be located on the number line. They then wrote a comparison of the two fractions, 5/8 > 1/3. On the count of three, all students held up their Clearboards for me to see. ",15,mtms2009-12-258a,,
"In seconds, I assessed who understood the concept and who did not. Students then erased their Clearboards, leaving the number line intact on the template. There was no need to create  another number line. I then gave them another two fractions to compare. This time I walked to the students who had displayed the incorrect answer the first time to help them with fraction placement and comparison. ",16,mtms2009-12-258a,,
"Reuse of Table and Graphs One lesson involved input and output function tables to determine missing values and to graph functions. Following a lesson on graphing linear functions, students placed a one-page template into their Communicator Clearboards that contained four x- and y-input and output tables on one side. A readymade pair of x- and y-axes that were already labeled and numbered with scales were placed on the other side. I drew some values on the board for the students to write for  some of the x- and y-fields of their first table. They then calculated and filled in the missing values in each column. Once their tables were complete, they flipped over their Clearboards to plot the points with their x- and y-values on the graph template. ",17,mtms2009-12-258a,,
"It is not necessary for students to  number their axes each time they create a graph. They can either plot different lines for each table on the same graph or merely erase the original line and start again on the next function. If they keep each line on the graph, they can compare the lines that each function ",18,mtms2009-12-258a,,

"Standards, especially Communication and Representation, in that it— •  gets every student actively involved  during the lesson or activity;  •  is inexpensive and cost effective; •  is simple to use because the templates for specific lessons can be switched in seconds; •  increases the opportunities for  students to use mathematical representations to share their ideas; •  allows the student to communicate  mathematically in other ways;  •  allows students to analyze and  evaluate the mathematical thinking of others by seeing how classmates solved a problem; and •  conserves paper.

"produces. A good exercise is to have the students create their own original axes and scales to place into their Clearboards so that they will not have to create a new one each time they need to plot values. This gives them the maximum amount of time for the concept they need to practice, which is plotting points and observing the slope of the line for the given function.",23,mtms2009-12-258a,,
