"What can We learn FroM the chinese perspectiVe? Overall, the perspective presented in the Chinese textbook is consistent with that of researchers and educators in school mathematics in the United States. That is, students need to learn more than just the algorithm for division of fractions. Moreover, the Chinese perspective includes several interesting approaches to what and how students learn beyond the algorithmic ",146,mtms2008-05-546a,,

"Move 20 miles in 2/5 hour procedure. In particular, the Chinese textbook makes good use of a problemsolving approach to help students construct the algorithm. Many American mathematics educators have advocated a similar approach (see, for example, Fosnot and Dolk 2002; Gregg and Gregg 2007; and Sharp and Adams 2002). The Chinese textbook begins with a multiplication-problem context to introduce both equal-sharing and measurement interpretations of division involving fractions (see fig. 2). It also uses the one-problem–multiplesolutions approach to provide students with a knowledge base to derive relevant computation procedures involving fractions (see figs. 3 and 4). The Chinese textbook emphasizes development of proficient computational skills and problem-solving abilities. Combined with the depth of content and the complexity of problems ",152,mtms2008-05-546a,,
"What do students need to learn about Fraction diVision? In terms of the algorithmic procedure, division of fractions is not overly difficult for students to learn and use to carry out computations. The ability to use this procedure, however, is not enough. As mentioned earlier, the topic of dividing fractions is open to rich conceptual explanations, but developing a conceptual understanding of the algorithmic procedure for dividing fractions is not an easy task for students or teachers. For this reason, both curriculum developers and teachers must consider the balance between the two aspects of the topic, the algorithmic process and the conceptual understanding. ",153,mtms2008-05-546a,,
"From the Chinese perspective, students are not expected to gain a full conceptual understanding of the  computational procedure for fraction division. In other words, students are not required to explain such terms or procedures as invert and change from division to multiplication. Providing a conceptual explanation of the computation procedure is the teacher’s responsibility, especially when students raise such questions in the classroom. Ma (1999) documented that most Chinese teachers in her sample were capable of providing a conceptual explanation. In contrast, researchers have found that some American teachers lack adequate mathematics preparation in this topic (see, for example, Ball [1990] and Ma [1999]). Thus, developing teachers’ conceptual understanding of fraction division should precede a similar expectation placed on their students. ",154,mtms2008-05-546a,,
"The Chinese perspective emphasizes students’ understanding of the meaning of fraction division as an inverse operation of fraction multiplication, a solid grasp of the computation rule, and more important, the ability to solve various application problems involving division and multiplication of fractions. In the Chinese textbook, the mathematical demands and richness of the topic are elevated through the inclusion of discussions of multiplicative relationships between quantities, complex application problems, and pictorial illustrations and an algebraic approach to solving application problems. In fact, the teacher reference book that accompanies the textbook suggests that four 40-minute lessons be devoted to teaching section 1 (the meaning of, and computational rule for, division of fractions) and six lessons be devoted to section 2 (application problems involving division of fractions). The implication is that Chinese students are expected to learn more than just the computational rule for fraction division. The emphasis placed on problem solving both as a means and an end for students’ ",155,mtms2008-05-546a,,
