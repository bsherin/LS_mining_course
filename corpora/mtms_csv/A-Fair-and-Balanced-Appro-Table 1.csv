0,A Fair and Balanced Approach to the Mean - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"If a Jeopardy answer were, Add em up and divide, the question might be, What is the mean? But this is not what the mean is; it is the algorithm for calculating the mean. The mean can be interpreted as a fair-share value and as a balance point. Standards documents, including Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSM) (CCSSI 2010), suggest focusing on both interpretations. We propose a sequence of five activities to help students develop these understandings of the mean, and we offer insights for implementing the activities. We include extensive use of representations, from concrete to abstract (Bruner 1966), to scaffold students experiences and sequence discussions.",,
1,A Fair and Balanced Approach to the Mean - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,ACTIVITY 1: DEVELOPING MEAN AS FAIR SHARE,,
2,A Fair and Balanced Approach to the Mean - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Data are numbers with context (Moore 1990); students enjoy exploring data when the contexts are meaningful. To explore the mean, we collected and used data for the number of books that each student read during August. These mostly single-digit yet variable values allowed students to use concrete manipulatives without being too cumbersome. The first activity includes data for this August book-reading context (see activity sheet 1).Each set has an integer mean to simplify calculations and to focus on important properties of the mean. We break the activity into parts and discuss each part to sequence strategies and to help students make connections among strategies.",,
3,A Fair and Balanced Approach to the Mean - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We first asked students to represent data to reveal trends (see activity sheet 1, question 1). Many students recorded the number of books in ascending order or created ordered displays, such as Abbys cube stacks (see fig. 1a). Students tendencies to represent each book for each person provided the impetus to explore mean as fair share.",,
4,A Fair and Balanced Approach to the Mean - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
5,A Fair and Balanced Approach to the Mean - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Students considered how many books each student would read if each read the same number (see activity sheet 1, Key Point 1). Although some students recognized the need for division by totaling the number of books and dividing by the number of students, most used cube or bar displays to find the fair-share value. We monitored students work to select and sequence their solution presentations according to the sophistication of their methods (Stein and Smith 2011). During students presentations, we asked questions, such as those displayed in table 1, to develop meaning within the context, explore relationships between ideas and representations, generate discussion, and probe and extend students thinking (Boaler and Brodie 2004). Throughout, we emphasized the importance of interpreting representations and values in context.",,
6,A Fair and Balanced Approach to the Mean - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
7,A Fair and Balanced Approach to the Mean - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We began a whole-class discussion by selecting a student to describe finding the fair-share value using cubes. For the data displayed in figure 1a, for example, Abby removed 4 cubes from the tallest stack, added 1 cube to each stack of 4, and added the remaining cubes to the shortest stack (see fig. 1). We prompted Abby to describe what she did (and why) to determine how many books each student would have read if everyone read the same number.",,
8,A Fair and Balanced Approach to the Mean - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"To move from concrete to pictorial representations, we asked a student who used ordered bars to share the solution and the thinking behind each step (see fig. 2). Meredith described moving 1 book from Danielle to Isla. She noticed that if she then moved 1 book to Carson, Riley, and Isla, each person would have read 5 books. Asking students to consider how books are represented in each solution and how the methods are similar or different can lead students to view the representations and processes used by Abby and Meredith as equivalent. Students moved cubes (representing books) to level, or equalize, stacks of cubes or moved bar segments (representing books) to level, or equalize, bars.",,
9,A Fair and Balanced Approach to the Mean - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
10,A Fair and Balanced Approach to the Mean - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The class considered the situation more abstractly when a student who totaled the number of books and then divided by the number of students presented his strategy. Students answered probing questions about why division was appropriate to connect fair share with partitive division: finding the size of each part (number of books) given the number of parts (students). Students also answered questions about how the total number of books, the number of students, and the number of books read by each student were represented in each solution method to make connections among representations and deepen their understanding of fair share. Continual focus on the context when comparing representations and describing the meanings of calculations supported students development of conceptual understanding of the mean.",,
11,A Fair and Balanced Approach to the Mean - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Additionally, students considered properties of fair-share values by responding to questions about what fair-share values revealed about data and comparing data sets with the same and different fair-share values (see activity sheet 1, questions 67, Key Points 23). Some students focused on characteristics that apply to some, but not all, data sets, such as fair-share values corresponding to the mode. Others highlighted properties such as fair-share values falling between minimum and maximum values or that they might not equal a data value. Students also identified characteristics of distributions, such as when different distributions had the same fair-share value; they also discussed what occurred when the fair-share value was higher for one distribution in that individual values may not follow the same trend. We encouraged students to test whether conjectures held in general by asking whether counterexamples existed and considering additional data sets. Repeatedly responding to questions such as those on the activity sheet and exploring multiple data sets supported students in making and testing conjectures to extend thinking.",,
12,A Fair and Balanced Approach to the Mean - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"An important property of the mean is that the sum of distances between the mean and values less than the mean equals the sum of distances between the mean and values greater than the mean. For example, for the data in figure 3, distances of 2, 1, and 1 for values less than the mean sum to 4, and a distance of 4 exists for the value greater than the mean. We asked students to consider distances in relation to the fair-share value by responding to questions 813 (see activity sheet 1). Discussion questions focused on deviations for values greater than and less than the mean and the relationship between the two using a table (see fig. 4). In particular, we asked students to consider whether observed patterns hold for both sets of data. To highlight the relationship among deviations, we added a row to each table to sum deviations. In general, students tentatively concluded that distances above and below the fair-share value balanced but suggested that working with the larger set of class data was too much. When students experience tedious calculations, it provides motivation to seek ways that are more efficient for finding fair-share values using alternative displays.",,

15,A Fair and Balanced Approach to the Mean - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,ACTIVITY 2: DISPLAYING DATA USING DOTPLOTS,,
16,A Fair and Balanced Approach to the Mean - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The dotplot at the bottom of figure 5 consists of a number line with dots stacked above the line to correspond to data values. In comparison with cube and ordered-bars displays, each dot in the dotplot represents an individual who read the corresponding number of books rather than a book or group of books.",,
17,A Fair and Balanced Approach to the Mean - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Students tended to struggle with changing from a focus on books and numbers of books when working with cubes and ordered bars to the focus on individuals and numbers of individuals when working with dotplots. To make this transition, we asked students to explore relationships among the three display types. We presented stacked graphs with aligned axes to compare the dotplot with the ordered-bar display and asked students to compare how each persons data were displayed, what the bars and dots represented, and how bars and dots were related. These questions helped students recognize that bar endpoints essentially were dropped to a number line for the dotplot, as illustrated by the arrows in figure 5.",,
18,A Fair and Balanced Approach to the Mean - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
19,A Fair and Balanced Approach to the Mean - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"To compare a cube display with its corresponding dotplot, students answered similar comparison questions to connect each stack of cubes to a dotplot dot (see fig. 6). Questions about how to display the data using a number line and stacks of cubes prompted some students to stand each stack of cubes on end to create a three-dimensional dotplot. Three- dimensional plots and explicit attention to connections among representations highlighted by the arrows in figure 6 enabled students to associate a dotplot with a top-down view of a three-dimensional plot.",,
20,A Fair and Balanced Approach to the Mean - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
21,A Fair and Balanced Approach to the Mean - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,ACTIVITY 3: TRANSITIONING TO MEAN AS BALANCE POINT,,
22,A Fair and Balanced Approach to the Mean - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Because each data value is a single dot in dotplots, they represent data more concisely than cubes or bars. Students work with the large set of class data often led them to value the conciseness of dotplots. However, students often could not determine fair-share values using dotplots. They tried to use processes such as those displayed in figure 2 with dotplots, but each dots representation of an individual rather than a book meant that students were leveling counts of students rather than counts of books. To help students determine fair-share values using dotplots, we asked students to use the three-dimensional dotplot to duplicate their work from figure 2 while placing newly formed stacks of cubes at proper values for each step. With input from students, we modeled the first step and asked students to complete the process to find the fair-share value. Figure 7 displays a top-down view of Mike and Megans progression from the initial three-dimensional dotplot to the fair-share plot.",,
23,A Fair and Balanced Approach to the Mean - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
24,A Fair and Balanced Approach to the Mean - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Although students could determine the fair-share value using the three-dimensional dotplot, reverting back to using cubes does not simplify the process. Students viewed the work as tedious, which led to an alternative method for finding the mean.",,
25,A Fair and Balanced Approach to the Mean - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,ACTIVITY 4: DEVELOPING MEAN AS A BALANCE POINT,,
26,A Fair and Balanced Approach to the Mean - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The fair-share value can be thought of as a mathematical point of balance. To help students make this connection, we asked students to determine the fair-share value for two people who read 5 and 15 books, respectively. Students then placed weights at 5 and 15 on a physical number balance (see fig. 8). We asked what students noticed about the balance point of 10 to establish that the fair-share value and the location of the balance point were the same for these data. We asked students to further explore balance points before making additional connections between the fair-share value and the balance point.",,
27,A Fair and Balanced Approach to the Mean - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
28,A Fair and Balanced Approach to the Mean - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"As outlined in activity sheet 2, students explored mean as a balance point by using physical balances to examine multiple distributions for samples of varying sizes. They connected physical representations with pictorial representations by creating dotplots to represent balances. As students worked, we monitored their responses and encouraged students to explore patterns and relationships to probe and extend their thinking. For example, we asked students to identify similarities among graphs in response to question 2 and create additional graphs as needed to recognize the symmetry around the balance point of 10; we then asked students to conjecture about whether data must be symmetrical about the mean for all data sets. Common student misconceptions about the mean included beliefs that the value of the mean must equal a data value, that data should be symmetrical around the mean, and that the mean and median were equivalent. Students confronted the first misconception when they found two different configurations for data sets of size 2. They confronted the remaining misconceptions as they determined configurations for data sets of sizes 4 and 5 (see activity sheet 2, questions 34).",,
29,A Fair and Balanced Approach to the Mean - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Through Key Points, students considered important properties of the mean by examining the relationship between the balance point and deviations from the balance point. Some students focused on characteristics, such as symmetry, to erroneously conclude that the balance point must be in the middle. Others highlighted properties, such as the balance point taking all data values into consideration. As students offered conjectures, they generated and explored additional data sets to determine whether counterexamples existed.",,
30,A Fair and Balanced Approach to the Mean - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"After students completed the exploration, we selected multiple student distributions with 5 weights (see fig. 9) and asked students to discuss similarities and differences among distributions. They identified similarities (such as a balance point of 10) and differences (such as variability). To connect the idea of mean as a fair-share value with mean as a balance point, students considered the sum of distances between the balance point and values to its left and the sum of distances between the balance point and values to its right in relation to their fair-share value work with deviations (see fig. 3) by constructing ordered bar graphs for each data set and making direct comparisons between displays. Throughout, we probed students thinking and had them explore relationships and consider the validity of claims. We let students know that the balance point, located at the fair-share value, was known as the mean.",,
31,A Fair and Balanced Approach to the Mean - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
32,A Fair and Balanced Approach to the Mean - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,ACTIVITY 5: CONNECTING TO THE ALGORITHM,,
33,A Fair and Balanced Approach to the Mean - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Some students enter sixth grade having experienced the mean as a calculation. The outlined activities move students beyond the algorithm by focusing on properties for the mean and interpreting the mean within context. Students experiences with the activities and whole-class discussions help them make connections to the algorithm for calculating the mean. We referred students to the ordered-bars representations in figure 2 to reiterate the number of students (6) whose data are represented and the fair-share value (5). Students then related the number of values, the mean, and the sum of all values with the following equation:",,
34,A Fair and Balanced Approach to the Mean - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,(Number of data values)  (Mean) = Sum of all data values,,
35,A Fair and Balanced Approach to the Mean - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,The standard algorithm to find the value of the mean emerged from this equation:,,
36,A Fair and Balanced Approach to the Mean - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
37,A Fair and Balanced Approach to the Mean - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Students also described how the three values in the number sentence are represented in graphs used to explore mean as a fair-share value (see figs. 1 and 2) and mean as a balance point (see fig. 9) to make connections among representations and tie together the sequence of activities.,,
38,A Fair and Balanced Approach to the Mean - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,THE MEAN AS MORE THAN AN ALGORITHM,,
39,A Fair and Balanced Approach to the Mean - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"By creating multiple distributions of values with the same mean, students can recognize that the mean is insufficient for describing data in context. Focusing on differences in variability among distributions can motivate the need for measures of variation, such as mean absolute deviation, to make distinctions among distributions. We also find benefit from the activities when we teach absolute value because students connect the balance point and distances from the point with the origin and distances between the origin and numerical values. Although this sequence of activities requires considerable class time, the benefits are well worth the investment and result in students who are more mathematically proficient and statistically literate.",,
