Think of any dusty surface. How did the dust get there? What is in dust? How many specks of dust can be found in one swipe of a dust cloth? ,4,mtms2010-02-368a,,
A single speck of dust weighs about 0.000001 grams. Use the conversion of 1 pound ≈ 453.6 grams in your calculations for the problems that follow.,5,mtms2010-02-368a,,

"Note to teachers: Providing correct labels is an important part of giving a correct answer. The recently released draft of the Common Core Standards states that a proficient mathematics student should be “careful about specifying units of measure” ( July 2009 Common Core Draft Standards, p. 6).",13,mtms2010-02-368a,,
"The solutions are appended to the online version of “Math for Real” at  www.nctm.org/mtms.  solutions to math for real (Continued from page 368) 1.  About 1 million specks of dust are  in 1 gram, or 1 × 106.",14,mtms2010-02-368a,,
"2.  453.6 grams per pound × (1 × 106 specks of dust per gram) = 4.536 × 108 specks of dust per pound. This is four hundred fifty-three billion, six hundred million specks of dust (or about four hundred fifty-four billion) specks per pound.",15,mtms2010-02-368a,,
"3.  40 pounds × 4.536 × 108 specks  of dust per pound ≈ 1.8144 × 1010 specks of dust, or one trillion, eight hundred fourteen billion, four hundred million specks of dust over an average lifetime.",16,mtms2010-02-368a,,
"Note: The mean lifespan for a female in the United States is about 80.36 years; that number is about 75.21 years for a male. For simplicity, these two numbers have been averaged to 78 years as the mean expected lifespan.  4.  40 pounds ÷ 78 years ≈ 0.513  pounds per year (or 8.2 ounces), which is about five hundred thirteen one thousandths, or  5.13 × 10-1.",17,mtms2010-02-368a,,
"5.  40 pounds ÷ (78 years × 365.25 days per year) ≈ 0.0014 pounds  (or 0.0224 ounces) of dead skin  per day, which is about 14 tenthousandths pounds per day, or  1.4 × 10-3 pounds per day.",18,mtms2010-02-368a,,
"6.  Students might use their calculation from problem 2 of 4.536 × 108 specks of dust per pound. The total number of specks of dust per day would be (4.536 × 108) × (1.4 × 10-3) ≈ 6.350 × 105                                     = 635,000. ",19,mtms2010-02-368a,,
"Alternately, students might use their calculation from problem 3 that a person produces 1.8144 × 1010 specks of dust per 78 years, which means about  2.326 × 108 specks of dust per year, or two hundred thirty-two million, six  hundred thousand. Then, 2.326 × 108 specks of dust per year ÷ 365.25 days per year ≈ 636,900 specks of dust per day, or 6.369 × 105 specks of dust per day, or six hundred thirty-six thousand, nine hundred. ",20,mtms2010-02-368a,,
"These two different calculations can lead to two important discussions about scientific notation:  1.  When students use scientific notation, two numbers can seem deceptively close. For example, the difference between 6.369 and 6.350 is 0.019, which students might think is a small difference. However, the difference between 6.369 × 105 and 6.350 × 105 is 1900, which is a much larger difference.  2.  When using scientific notation,  numbers are often rounded. Rounding numbers in different ways can have significant consequences for subsequent calculations. ",21,mtms2010-02-368a,,
