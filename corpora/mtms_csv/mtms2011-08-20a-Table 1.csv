"You know that 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. This makes 6 a very special number called a perfect number. A perfect number is equal to the sum of all its divisors that are less than the number itself. (These divisors are called the proper divisors of the number.) The numbers 1, 2, and 3 are the only numbers less than 6 that are divisors, or factors, of 6 (1 × 6 = 6 and 2 × 3 = 6).  1. People sometimes talk about being  “at a perfect age.” A mathematically perfect age can only happen twice in a lifetime. The ﬁ rst time occurred when you were 6 years old. How old will you be the next time your age is a perfect number? Hint: It will occur in your 20s.  2. The third perfect number is 496. ",2,mtms2011-08-20a,,
"To verify this fact, ﬁ nd all the proper divisors of 496 and show that they sum to 496.",3,mtms2011-08-20a,,
3. Two numbers are called amicable (“amicable” means friendly) if the proper divisors of each number sum to equal the other number. Pythagoras and other mathematicians discovered about 550 BC that the ﬁ rst pair of amicable numbers was 220 and 284. Show that the proper divisors of 220 sum to 284 and that the proper divisors of 284 sum to 220.,4,mtms2011-08-20a,,
"challenge 4. Mathematicians classify all whole numbers into three sets: perfect, abundant, and deﬁ cient. A number is abundant if the sum of all its proper divisors is greater than the number. The number 12 is abundant because 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16, and 16 > 12. A number is deﬁ cient if the sum of all its proper divisors is less than the number. For example, 8 is deﬁ cient because 1 + 2 + 4 = 7, and 7 < 8. Divide the list of numbers between 2 and 100 among your classmates and collaborate to classify them as perfect, abundant, or deﬁ cient.  soMe PeRFectlY aMaZing Facts •  Ancient Greek mathematicians found 4 perfect numbers (the fourth is 8128), but it took almost 2000 years before the ﬁ fth perfect number was discovered. The search for perfect numbers is currently an active area of mathematics.",5,mtms2011-08-20a,,

solUtions 1.  The second perfect number is 28:   1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28 2.  The factor pairs of 496 are 1 × 496; 2 × 248; 4 × 124; 8 × 62; and 16 × 31. Sum the factors (less than 496) to see that 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 31 + 62 + 124 + 248 = 496.,11,mtms2011-08-20a,,

We loved this activity! I asked my students to work on this assignment in pairs to review factors and multiples. They were especially interested in the patterns of numbers and were intrigued by the fact that these extraordinary numbers had their own special name. They had “mathematician discussions” with their partners (what I call their “talks” to remind the students to discuss math topics and  problem-solving techniques). Their discussions lasted several minutes longer than ones earlier in the year. Several students telephoned classmates at home that evening to continue their discussions.,16,mtms2011-08-20a,,
"The students took about one hour,  thirty minutes in total to complete the assignment. Producing the list of abundant and deficient numbers took the longest. They were so interested in discovering the patterns that they did  not complain about the time. In fact, I am not sure that they even noticed. They were fully engaged in this assignment for the complete class  period and had to be reminded to leave for lunch. Now that is engaged!",17,mtms2011-08-20a,,
"The facts about perfect numbers  at the bottom of the page greatly interested the students, which resulted in even more “mathematician discussions” about what discoveries the pair could make if students kept going ",18,mtms2011-08-20a,,

"Although I teach sixth-grade advanced math, some students struggle with topics found in general sixth-grade math. We had been working on operations with fractions with unlike denominators. I thought that this activity would be a fun way to find the factors of a number as well as learn some interesting facts about numbers. ",26,mtms2011-08-20a,,
The students had an easy time  understanding perfect numbers and thought that these numbers were “cool.” We were able to work through deficient and abundant numbers but needed to extend what was provided. ,27,mtms2011-08-20a,,
The students became stumped working with amicable numbers but were able to solve the problem with some practice. They found the facts interesting.,28,mtms2011-08-20a,,

A group of seventh-grade algebra 1 students completed this activity as they were starting a unit on exponent rules and polynomials. They had already reviewed the meaning of perfect squares and cubes and had discovered that there are many ways to classify numbers. That’s Perfect! was a natural activity to extend the lesson.

"All groups were able to name 28 as  the next perfect number by thinking through lists of factors. However, finding all the divisors of 496 produced a variety of strategies. Many used trial and error. A few used prime factorization. One group arranged the factor pairs in a T table and discovered that they could “move a 2 from one column to the other” several times, generating all the powers-of-two divisors. The class was so engaged in their number play that they were disappointed when the period ended because some students had not finished. After establishing that the number 6 may not be a perfect square but that it is rectangular and triangular, the students were excited to learn that it is also perfect.",36,mtms2011-08-20a,,
"In previous years, I have used The Number Devil: A Mathematical Adventure (Enzensberger 1997) to introduce this topic to my students. Later in the week, we used this activity with a group of fifth through eighth graders in a math club. The group had already explored ways to find pairs of factors using prime factorization. The eighth graders took on the role of teacher and led the activity. It was a great way to reinforce the use of divisibility rules.",37,mtms2011-08-20a,,
