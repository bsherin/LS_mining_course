6,Window on Resources  May 2014,"In this book, the authors describe five big ideas that are essential for students to understand conceptually. These ideas are discussed in detail in chapter 1, which includes essential understandings for each big idea. ",6,Window on Resources  May 2014

8,Window on Resources  May 2014,"The information provided is detailed enough for a teacher who might have little knowledge of statistics. In some cases, the authors include sources for teachers to gain such knowledge when needed. This chapter is easy to read, and the examples that are provided make the big ideas easier to understand. ",8,Window on Resources  May 2014
9,Window on Resources  May 2014,"In chapter 2, the authors describe  a progression for each big idea on how students transfer their informal reasoning to formal reasoning. Although this chapter is informative, I had hoped that there would be more information on each progression. ",9,Window on Resources  May 2014
10,Window on Resources  May 2014,"Out of all the chapters, I enjoyed  reading chapter 3 the most. The authors provide ways in which to develop good statistics questions, and they offer rubrics to assess sample student responses. I really liked seeing a moderately good question develop into a really good question, which involved including a context and an opportunity for students to provide interpretations and demonstrate their conceptual understanding. Throughout the entire book, questions were included that offered the reader an opportunity to reflect on what they had just read. As a mathematics educator, I thought about how I could modify these same questions to use in my classroom.  —E. Paige Gillentine",10,Window on Resources  May 2014

15,Window on Resources  May 2014,"As teachers, we may never fully realize how the little things that we do influence our students’ understanding of mathematics. As I read Baggett’s memoir of becoming a successful mathematician despite losing his sight in a childhood accident, I was reminded that the little things that we do to help our students learn can have a huge impact on how and what they understand about the world of mathematics, including their confidence in their mathematical abilities.",15,Window on Resources  May 2014

19,Window on Resources  May 2014,"In this book, appropriate for grades 9–12, Bill Hanlon discusses strategies to help struggling students learn mathematics. He describes protocols, expectations, and instructional strategies to help students memorize facts and algorithms. He also discusses test prep and teacher-student relationships and how they inﬂ uence student performance. ",19,Window on Resources  May 2014
20,Window on Resources  May 2014,"One strength of this book is its emphasis on the importance of balanced instruction in the classroom. The author discusses how vocabulary can be an obstacle for struggling students and that teachers need to spend time explicitly teaching vocabulary. Another strength is the strong  emphasis on building teacher-student relationships. “Remember, treat your students the same way you want your own sons or daughters treated by another teacher.”",20,Window on Resources  May 2014
21,Window on Resources  May 2014,"However, this book is extremely weak in presenting actual solutions for struggling students. The author suggests tactics that would contribute to math anxiety and alienate students. At one point, he indicates that teachers should call on students to recite memorized material in a straight line across the room, beginning on the side with students who are more engaged and then moving toward the students who are not engaged so as to raise their “anxiety and attention.” ",21,Window on Resources  May 2014
