"The Editorial Panel is presenting the following problem to stimulate submissions to “The Thinking of Students” department. We encourage teachers to try this problem with students and analyze the different ways that students solve it. Feel free to photocopy this problem for use in your classroom. Please send the following if students generate unique strategies:  •  A brief analysis of the specific  strategy •  Examples of students’ work •   Your name, the school name  and address, and    your e-mail address",2,mtms2007-08-37a,,
Teachers might want to have groups of students work cooperatively to solve this particular problem.,3,mtms2007-08-37a,,

"According to a September 2006 report by Forbes magazine, the combined wealth of America’s 400 richest people is $1.25 trillion. According to the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, a dollar bill is 2.61 inches wide and 6.14 inches long. It is also 0.0043 inches thick.",7,mtms2007-08-37a,,

"shares. Since A + C = 1/3, then –A – C = –1/3. Also, A + B = 1/2, so if we add corresponding parts of the last two equations, we find that B – C = 1/2 + –1/3, so B – C = 1/6. We also know that B + C = 1/5, so if we add corresponding parts of these last two equations, we find that 2B = 1/6 +  1/5 = 11/30, so B = 11/60. Thus, since B + C = 1/5, we find that C = 1/5 – 11/60 = 1/60. Finally, since A + C = 1/3, then A = 1/3 – 1/60 = 19/60.",9,mtms2007-08-37a,,
15. 95. We will start with 99 and work our way down until we find a twodigit number that is the product of different prime numbers and is used only once.,10,mtms2007-08-37a,,
"99 = (3)(3)(11), so 99 is not a product  of different primes that are used only once.  98 = (2)(7)(7); 98 is also not a product  of different primes that are used only once.  97 is prime, but it is the product of  only one prime number.",11,mtms2007-08-37a,,
"96 = (2)(2)(2)(2)(2)(3), which is also not a product of different primes that are used only once.  95 = (5)(19), so 95 is our solution.",12,mtms2007-08-37a,,
"Another way to state the original problem would have been to ask, “What is the largest two-digit number you can obtain from a product of two or more distinct primes?”  a Thursday. April 1 was a Friday, so April 29 was also a Friday, making the last day of April (the 30th) a Saturday. May 1 was a Sunday, so May 29 was a Sunday and therefore May 31 was a Tuesday. June 1 was a Wednesday, and so was June 29. June 30 was a Thursday, so July 1 was on Friday. Therefore, July 4, 2005, occurred on a Monday.

"Answers will vary. ● 16. Monday. January 1 was Saturday, so add 7s to this day to find other days that were also Saturdays: January 8, 15, 22, 29 (or add 28, the largest multiple of 7 that would make sense here, to find the last Saturday in January). January 31 was a Monday, so February 1 was a Tuesday. February 28 would have been a Monday and since there was no leap-year February 29 to add, March 1 was a Tuesday. Adding 28 days, we see that March 29 was a Tuesday, so March 31 was ",16,mtms2007-08-37a,,
