"Alex, a seventh-grade student in Meredith Schuster’s  mathematics  class  at  Carusi  Middle  School, Cherry Hill, New Jersey, sent the solution seen in figure 1. Alex first set up a table to show what he knew and what he wanted to know. Next, he determined the new height of the box by essentially setting up a proportion to find the amount of height to add to the original height (see fig. 2), then finding the total height of the new box. After finding the new-box height, he determined how much additional volume is added with the new height. Since 12 cm is added to the original height, then 12 × 30 × 20, or 7,200 cm3, will be added to the volume. Alex then determined how much to reduce the width of the box, since the length of the box is fixed, to reduce the volume by 7,200 cm3 and keep the volume of the new box the same as the original. To adjust the width, Alex determined what width will ",4,mtms2007-02-348a,,

"A  cereal  company  wants  to  change  the  dimensions of its boxes while keeping the same volume. The box designers are to increase the height (h) of the box by 30% and reduce the width (w). Before the change, the dimensions of the box are  l = 20 cm, h = 40 cm, and w = 30 cm. If the length (l)  of  the  new  box  remains  the  same,  what  will be its height and width, rounded to the nearest hundredth of a centimeter?",6,mtms2007-02-348a,,

It highlights students’ work, including projects, investigations, or creative solutions to the problems in the monthly “Solve It!” department. Original student work is included along with sufficient information  about  the  activity  so  that  readers  can  try  the ideas with their students.

"Fig. 1  Alex’s changing-sizes solution result in a volume of 7,200 cm3, given that the height and  length  are  52  cm  and  20  cm,  respectively.  He found that the width would be approximately 6.92 cm, which is how much must be subtracted from the original width to find the new-box width. This new width, 23.08 cm, along with the new height and length, will result in a box with 30 percent increased height and the same volume as the original box.",9,mtms2007-02-348a,,
"Alex’s solution focused on examining the amount of change. Another method to find the new dimensions is as follows. first, the new height must be increased 30 percent of the original height. Therefore, you can determine 130 percent of 40 cm, the original height of the box. The volume of the original box is 20 × 30 × 40, or 24,000 cm3, which is also what the volume of the new box must be. The new box has a height of 52 cm and a length of 20 cm. Divide the volume by the new height and length to find the new width, which is 23.08 cm.",10,mtms2007-02-348a,,
"An extension of the task is given in figure 3. In this case, the designers want to use 25 percent less material in the box. This requires students to examine the surface area. In this case, the surface area of the original box is 5,200 cm2. The new box, which must use 25 percent less material or have 75 percent of the surface area of the original box, will be 3,900 cm2.  Examples  of  boxes  that  have  a  surface  area  of  3,900  cm2  are  20  cm  ×  30  cm  ×  27  cm;  5  cm  ×  15 cm × 93.75 cm; and 40 cm × 10 cm × 31 cm. ",11,mtms2007-02-348a,,
Several factors can be considered when deciding on the dimensions of a cereal box. One factor is the height of shelves; there is no need to make a cereal box  that  will  not  fit  on  a  grocery  store  or  cabinet shelf. Another factor is the width; it is impractical to make a box that is too wide for a person to grasp. Another factor is the capacity of the new box; will the new  box  hold  a  reasonable  amount  of  cereal?  You may want to encourage students to make mock-ups of boxes to help them consider these factors. ,12,mtms2007-02-348a,,
