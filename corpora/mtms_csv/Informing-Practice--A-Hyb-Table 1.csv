3,Informing Practice: A Hybrid Perspective on Functions,What is a function? What is an example of a function? Teachers’ responses to these questions range from “a relationship between things that can be graphed” to “a connection between things that can be defined symbolically” to “a machine which you plug in something and get something out.” (See more examples in fig. 1.) ,3,Informing Practice: A Hybrid Perspective on Functions
4,Informing Practice: A Hybrid Perspective on Functions,"Consider these definitions in comparison with the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics’s (CCSSM) description of a function “as a rule that assigns to each input exactly one output”(CCSSI 2010, p. 52). At the same time, CCSSM suggests that eighth-grade students “use functions to model relationships between quantities” (p. 53). However, in many cases, students in eighth grade and beyond do not have understandings of function that reflect the definition in CCSSM. Figure 2 shows the exchange that occurred between a  mathematics teacher and an eighthgrade algebra student following a unit focused on functions.

5,Informing Practice: A Hybrid Perspective on Functions,"The responses given by the student, Brian, are illustrative of many eighth-grade students’ early conceptions of function (a machine and a picture). However, these images are disconnected from the notion of function described in CCSSM and its intended uses (e.g., modeling). One source of that disconnect may be that the notion of function as a rule of assignment (input-output, or function machine) is not necessarily productive for students conceiving of relationships between quantities because it does not entail an image of two quantities varying in tandem. For instance, if the requirement for an object to be a function is that it acts as a machine and that it has a picture of a graph associated with it, there is no sense of function representing variation between quantities.

7,Informing Practice: A Hybrid Perspective on Functions,"The research literature on students’ thinking about functions and teachers’ instruction related to the concept focuses on two dominant perspectives. To frame these perspectives, we consider an activity in which students used data collection devices to measure the speed of a toy car over a period of ten seconds at intervals of 0.5 seconds. Students were asked to determine whether the car’s speed was a function of time and justify why or why not, as shown in figure 3a.",7,Informing Practice: A Hybrid Perspective on Functions
8,Informing Practice: A Hybrid Perspective on Functions,"Jill’s response is reflective of the first perspective on function, called rule of assignment. This approach involves an image of mapping an input to an output (Breidenbach et al. 1992; Dubinsky and Harel 1992). A student thinks about function as a specific rule or formula. For instance, the student can imagine plugging in any number for x in the function, f, defined to get an output, y. In the rule-of-assignment approach, the relationship between quantities x and y is contained in the “black box” through which each input, x, passes. As a consequence, there is not necessarily a notion of a function representing an invariant relationship between quantities (as CCSSM describes).

Ethan’s response is illustrative of the second perspective, which is function as covariation (Carlson, Larsen, and Jacobs 2001; Castillo-Garsow 2010; Confrey and Smith 1995; Thompson 1994), based on Saldanha and Thompson’s  (1998, pp. 298-99) characterization of covariational reasoning as grounded in images of two quantities’ values varying simultaneously: ",16,Informing Practice: A Hybrid Perspective on Functions
17,Informing Practice: A Hybrid Perspective on Functions,"Our notion of covariation is of someone holding in mind a sustained  image of two quantities’ values (magnitudes) simultaneously. It entails coupling the two quantities, so that, in one’s understanding, a multiplicative object is formed of the two. As a multiplicative object, one tracks either quantity’s value with the immediate, explicit, and persistent realization that, at every moment, the other quantity also has a value. ",17,Informing Practice: A Hybrid Perspective on Functions
18,Informing Practice: A Hybrid Perspective on Functions,"For example, consider a situation in which a person is moving and there are two quantities: the amount of distance she has traveled and the amount of time elapsed since  she began traveling. One would be reasoning covariationally if (a) she conceived of both quantities and their individual variation (i.e., time varies, distance varies); and (b) she conceived of those quantities as varying simultaneously, so that when she thinks about a person’s distance traveled, she has an image of the amount of time needed to travel that distance. There is no sense of input or output required (although it may be present) within covariational reasoning, but it may be developed from notions of covariation. For instance, sticking with the example of the person moving, causation (i.e., elapsed time causes elapsed distance, or vice versa) arises because of the person’s conception of the situation, not because one quantity has ",18,Informing Practice: A Hybrid Perspective on Functions

27,Informing Practice: A Hybrid Perspective on Functions,"Drawing the distinction between function as a rule of assignment and function as covariation creates a dichotomy that some might perceive as a reason to choose one over the other. However, as we described above, thinking about a function as covariation does not preclude thinking about input and output or independence and dependence. Indeed, in many cases we want students to be able to think flexibly about function, which might eventually involve both approaches illustrated by Jill and Ethan’s responses in figure 3a and 3b, respectively.

28,Informing Practice: A Hybrid Perspective on Functions,"These questions must then be  asked: How can we support students in learning to use both approaches, and would it be useful?

As her response illustrates, using the hybrid approach, input-output can emerge once students imagine the function as a relationship between two quantities varying in tandem.

51,Informing Practice: A Hybrid Perspective on Functions,"It became apparent that students are accustomed to starting with an input and determining the resulting output. Textbooks as well as previous tasks and tests ask students to do this so often that any question including the word function or a symbol for one implicitly includes calculation. This situation automatically draws students’ attention away from thinking about a function as being a fixed relationship between quantities. One student, Tyler, noted the following:",51,Informing Practice: A Hybrid Perspective on Functions

60,Informing Practice: A Hybrid Perspective on Functions,"Another issue that emerged during observations of teachers and discussions with students was how to integrate covariational reasoning  into graphs of functions. For instance, students often worked with completed graphs that had accompanying questions asking when an input produced a specific output or when an output was produced by a specific input. This scenario does not help engender an image of quantities varying simultaneously but rather a focus on “fact finding,” as one student put it. A natural way to address this issue is to help students see the construction of a graph as reliant on covariation of quantities.",60,Informing Practice: A Hybrid Perspective on Functions
