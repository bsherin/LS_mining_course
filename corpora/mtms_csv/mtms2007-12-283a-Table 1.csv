(Solutions on page 295) the three Bears cookie store,4,mtms2007-12-283a,,
"The Bear family decided to open a cookie store that featured bear-sized cookies. Mama and Baby Bear decorated the cookies, and Papa Bear sold the cookies. Mama Bear could completely decorate a cookie every 7 minutes. Baby Bear could completely decorate a cookie every 12 minutes. Unfortunately, Papa Bear was eating one of the cookies every 9 minutes. If they open the store and have no cookies decorated, how long will it take them to produce 500 decorated cookies that can be sold? ",5,mtms2007-12-283a,,
