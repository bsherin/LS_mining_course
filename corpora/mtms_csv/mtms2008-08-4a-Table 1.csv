"The Representational Value of hats tThe literature that is available on the  topic of representations in mathematics is vast. One commonly discussed item is graphical representations. From the history of mathematics to modern uses of technology, a variety of graphical forms are available for middle school students to use to represent mathematical ideas. The ideas range from algebraic relationships to summaries of data sets. Traditionally, ",0,mtms2008-08-4a,,
"Jane M. Watson, Noleine E. Fitzallen, Karen G. Wilson,  and Julie F. Creed textbooks delineate the rules  to be followed in creating  conventional graphical forms, and software offers alternatives for attractive presentations. Is there anything new to introduce in the way of graphical representations for middle school students? This article presents a new data representation tool called the hat plot, which is a featured tool of the data analysis software ",1,mtms2008-08-4a,,

"TinkerPlots Dynamic Data Exploration (Konold and Miller 2005). TinkerPlots software gives students considerable freedom to create graphs to tell the stories of their data sets. Because the hat plot representation will most likely be new to middle school students, it is important to explore the concepts that the hat plot represents, how students use it, and how it links with students’ intuitive notions of distribution. Examples of student work illustrate the potential of hat plots as a representation that can be used to make sense of data.",4,mtms2008-08-4a,,
"Studies advocate that students  should be allowed and encouraged to create their own forms of graphical representation before being introduced formally to conventional graphs (Watson 2006). This constructivist approach to representing data inspired the developers of TinkerPlots to allow students considerable freedom in using  this graphing software. Data initially appear as haphazardly arranged icons in space (see fig. 1). Students then choose attributes they would like to display and how they would like the icons arranged, for example, in bins (see fig. 2) or stacked along a continuous scale (see fig. 3).

"Among the summary tools available is the hat plot, so named for its appearance resembling a hat with a crown in the middle and a brim on each side (see fig. 4). The brim is a line that extends to the range of the data set, and the crown is a rectangle that shows, by default, the location of the middle 50 percent of the data. The other important feature is that the hat plot is usually superimposed ",9,mtms2008-08-4a,,

Difficulties in understanding and explaining the representation, especially if the exact data values are not presented under the box-and-whisker plot, have led mathematics educators to suggest that the box-and-whisker plot not be introduced to middle school students but postponed until the secondary years (Bakker et al. 2005).",11,mtms2008-08-4a,,
"As can be seen by comparing  figures 4 and 5, a hat plot is a simplified version of a box-and-whisker plot, focusing directly on the center half of the data and the extreme quarters.

"For those familiar with recent  innovations in graphing, the hat plot is similar to a box-and-whisker plot. In a box-and-whisker plot, whiskers emanate from the ends of a box representing the middle half of the data. Straightforward box-andwhisker plots are shown in figures 5 and 6, with the whiskers extending to the lowest and highest values in the data sets. Another feature of a boxand-whisker plot is the representation of the median as a vertical line across the box showing the middle value of the ordered data set. Typically, boxand-whisker plots are shown without displaying the data they represent.",15,mtms2008-08-4a,,
"Although a box-and-whisker plot is  often used to represent data, researchers have found that students do not find it easy to interpret because of the inverse relationship between the size of the four sections of the plot and the spread or density of the values represented (Bakker, Biehler, and Konold 2005). In the box-and-whisker plot in figure 5, for example, the smaller left-hand portion of the central box represents the same number of data values as the larger right-hand portion of the box. This means that the left quarter of the central half is more ",16,mtms2008-08-4a,,
"The hat plot is a more general  tool than the box-and-whisker plot and is more flexible. TinkerPlots has four types of hat plots (see table 1), with each type using a different rule for constructing the central crown. The default locations of the crown edges can be adjusted by dragging the crown edges once the plot appears. In this way, for example, it is possible to make percentile hat plots that include 90 percent of the cases in the center part or standard deviation hat plots that range from –2 to +2 standard deviations. For the purposes of this article, students’ application of the default hat plot representation, which is most similar to the box-and- whisker plot, is explored.",17,mtms2008-08-4a,,
"The question for middle school  mathematics teachers is whether students find the features of hat plots useful in telling the story within the data set being studied. “Telling the story” in a hat plot is a representational transition to drawing an informal inference about the data being investigated. The rest of this article uses work from students in grades 5 to 7 to illustrate (1) how students used hat plots when analyzing data and (2) the connections students made between hat plots and significant aspects of spread and clustering in data sets. The students whose graphs are  shown in this article worked either in pairs with a teacher-researcher or in a class of about thirteen with their usual teacher and a teacher-researcher. During pair work, students worked with a single computer, whereas in the class environment each student had a computer. After introductory sessions, the students analyzed data sets collected from themselves and their classmates. As the final activity, the class group considered a data set provided with the TinkerPlots package. Some comments were written by students in text boxes within TinkerPlots, and other thoughts were jotted down by observers.",18,mtms2008-08-4a,,

"Given the results of research showing that students have difficulties interpreting box-and-whisker plots, it was somewhat surprising to teachers how easily these middle school students were able to use the hat plots, often on their own initiative. After teachers initially introduced the software, they reported observing most students employing hat plots when constructing graphical representations from new data sets, possibly because of the ease with which hat plots in TinkerPlots can be applied to a graph. Of more interest is the way in which students used the hat plot when further analyzing data. During the final teaching session, students were given three graphs that had been produced from a data set, which contained information about the heights of children at ages 2, 9, and 18 years (Konold and Miller 2005). The data from each of the age groups by gender were presented  in separate graphs, which included hat plots. Students were asked to consider and comment on the differences and changes in heights between the males and females at age 2, 9, and 18. Figure 8 shows the graph as presented to the students for the data at age 18 years.",22,mtms2008-08-4a,,
"Out of the fifteen students in the  class, twelve discussed the hat plot when referring to the central 50 percent of the data. The following three summaries illustrate students’ use of the hat plot.",23,mtms2008-08-4a,,
"I found that men continue to grow through all three graphs, but the female growth rate slows between 9 and 18. The range for the first graph is particularly small compared to the others. Also the men’s middle 50 percent is bigger than the females’ middle 50 percent on all three graphs. And the brims are very big on all 3 graphs.  2 years—the males are spread out more than the girls in the hat plots  as part of numeracy and part-whole reasoning, some were insecure in their application. When students discussed what their hat plots represented, the language of percents came to the fore. At times, students made comparisons based on the relative placements of the hats and where subparts of the data were in relation to one another.",24,mtms2008-08-4a,,
"There were also opportunities,  however, to use students’ comments from the text boxes to detect misunderstandings related to the part-whole nature of the percent representation in the hat. The following comment was made about the graph in figure 8:",25,mtms2008-08-4a,,
"The female’s height range is more clustered and all squashed together, whereas the male height range is more evenly spread out. When both the males and females are 18, the hat plots are starting to separate. And the crown is starting to hold more dots. ",26,mtms2008-08-4a,,
"Since the numbers of males and females were the same, the relationship of a wider crown to a greater spread rather than more values was confusing to this student. Teachers need to reinforce the interaction of quantity and spread at every opportunity.",27,mtms2008-08-4a,,

"Understanding percent as part of proportional reasoning is an important goal of middle school mathematics as are such links to fractions as 25 percent = one quarter and 50 percent = one half. For many students, the visual representation in the hat plot creates two links: one to the basic numerical fraction and percent facts involved and the other to a concrete context to see the utility of the part-whole relationship.",29,mtms2008-08-4a,,

Fig. 9 Graphs with hat plots of arm spans of middle school males and females and the hat plots overlap each other. 9 years—there’s not much difference between the middle 50 percent and most of the hat plots overlap each other. 18 years—there is a little difference between the middle 50 percent. The hat plots [the crown] start to separate from each other. ,31,mtms2008-08-4a,,
"On the plot where both males and females are at 18, it shows the majority of the males are taller than the females. In the last graph the hats don’t overlap as they did in the middle graph. The range is not the same between boys and girls. ",32,mtms2008-08-4a,,
"In relation to summarizing data, one student reflected, “The hat plots are the main help because they make it easier to compare the boys and the girls.” This idea was discussed in greater detail by another student: ",33,mtms2008-08-4a,,
"At the start the males and females are a close cluster but as they progress the male group spreads out, whilst the females stay together, the hats help us decide this by: there is not much difference at the age of 2 and at the age of 9, but when they turn 18 the hats show a significant difference, the girl’s crown stretches from 162.4 cm to 169.8, whilst the males stretch from 176.4 cm to 183.0 cm.

"MaKing the tRansition FRoM individUal data valUes to gRoUp chaRacteRistics Before the students in these middle school classes were introduced to TinkerPlots, they had little experience handling data. As such, they were typical of most students who are interested in individual values in the data set (Ben-Zvi 2004). When discussing a graph displaying the heights of students in their class, for example, they would focus on which student was the tallest or the shortest. Although this interest did not disappear with the appearance of the hat plot, it was complemented by an appreciation of group characteristics, such as the width of the brim or the spread of the data within a specific region. This is seen in reports written by grade 7 students about arm spans of boys and girls in the following examples.",35,mtms2008-08-4a,,
"The graph in figure 9 represents the  data associated with the relationship between arm span and gender collected from students in grades 5 to 8. In the graph, the males (m) and females (f) are separated, each with its own hat plot. The appearance seemed to influence a comment on spread in the text box that might not be expected in a novice: “There is a big difference in arm spans with the boys but the girls are all concentrated in the middle of the range.”",36,mtms2008-08-4a,,

"The application of the hat representation as a metaphor for summarizing data appeared easy for the middle school students to absorb. One grade 6 student, for example, offered this comment about a graph that included a hat plot, “You can learn more because you can see the stats.” This comment followed discussion of ranges, means, and medians in relation to comparing two data sets. Additionally, the notion that the brim on either side of the crown represented individually 25 percent of the data set was easy for students to relate to. When one student was describing the parts of a hat plot (see fig. 11) to another student, the following explanation was given.",43,mtms2008-08-4a,,
It doesn’t matter that this brim [right brim] is longer than the other. They both equal the same amount. It is just that the range of this side [left brim] is shorter than on the other side. The data is more spread out on the other side [right brim]. ,44,mtms2008-08-4a,,
"Although not as sophisticated as  might be expected from older students, these descriptions and the use of hat plots indicate their value as representations. As important to the representational strengths of the hat plot were three observed aspects of the students’ use of hat plots. The first aspect involved the natural way in which students either suggested the use of the tool on their own  initiative to analyze data or could interpret a hat plot presented to them by the teacher. Hence, the hat plot became both an intuitive and reflective part of data representation. Second, it was encouraging to note that hat plots gave students the opportunity to apply their underlying knowledge of percent in a familiar context and in some cases exposed students’ misconceptions. The third aspect was the observed focus from individual data values to characteristics of subgroups or aggregates of the entire data set. These aspects enabled students to be able to tell the story from the data in meaningful and descriptive ways. ",45,mtms2008-08-4a,,
