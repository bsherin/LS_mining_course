Modular Origami:  Moving beyond Cubes  Victoria L. Miles,1,mtms2011-10-180a,,
"Origami, or the process of paper folding, has been a popular activity among middle school math students. Numerous books and articles have been written on the subject of paper folding within a mathematical context. Modular origami, also called unit origami, requires two or more pieces  of paper folded into congruent shapes called modules or units. Two or more units are then assembled together to construct the final origami model. Modular origami provides an interesting vehicle for connecting the Standards of Geometry, Measurement, Algebra, and Communication. ",2,mtms2011-10-180a,,

"This Mathematical Exploration details an origami lesson that is suitable for middle school math classes. While working through the activity, students will— 1.  enhance their spatial reasoning ability by correctly folding and  assembling a unit origami model. 2.  be able to identify and define important geometric terms, because the model is permeated with twodimensional and three-dimensional figures.",5,mtms2011-10-180a,,
"3.  gain a deeper understanding of  area, in general, and surface area, in particular.",6,mtms2011-10-180a,,
"However, an overarching goal is for students to have fun while learning relevant mathematical content.",7,mtms2011-10-180a,,
"In my middle school math class, ",8,mtms2011-10-180a,,
"I introduce a few origami models before the December vacation. We begin with a simple rectangular prism constructed from one piece of paper. From there, we shift to a modular origami cube built using six congruent squares. Students enjoy the folding process. Mathematical communication is a natural outcome of creasing, assembling, and inspecting the models. Students are presented with an extra-credit opportunity over vacation to research new unit origami models. Assessment criteria include constructing models with precision, recording the folding directions, and being able to show me how to make their models.",9,mtms2011-10-180a,,
"The day after vacation, a female student walked spiritedly into class with a captivating paper model that I had not seen before. The model was a stellated octahedron, which is a star-like polyhedron containing eight congruent triangular pyramids. The polyhedron intrigued students, as shown by several female students wearing miniature stellated origami earrings. After the student skillfully taught me  how to make the folds and assemble the shape, I decided to teach this model to my math classes and use it as a tool to explore geometry and algebra concepts. ",10,mtms2011-10-180a,,
"During the first day, students worked with a partner on activity sheet 1. They constructed six modules each for a total of twelve modules that were necessary to assemble a stellated octahedron. Students followed an instructional video to fold the first piece. A document camera was also used to record a demonstration for the second piece. Students worked with their partners to fold modular pieces three and four. To fold modules five and six, students worked independently.  constRUcting the Model",11,mtms2011-10-180a,,
"As students work together through the directions on activity sheet 1, folding each module and constructing a stellated octahedron, give a few helpful hints to keep students moving on the right path. See the sidebar on page 182 for illustrated instructions.",12,mtms2011-10-180a,,
Folding Hints •	 Students	should	not	go	beyond	an	 existing crease when making a new crease. Doing so will cause interference in the remaining folds.,13,mtms2011-10-180a,,
•	 Students	should	stack	the	modules	 together as they fold. This is helpful because an incorrectly folded piece will be obvious immediately.,14,mtms2011-10-180a,,
"Assembling Advice •	 Identify	pockets	and	tabs.	The	 pockets are the smaller, acute triangles into which tabs will be inserted. The tabs are the pointed, acute triangles on both ends of the piece.",15,mtms2011-10-180a,,
"•	 Verify	that	students	are	able	to	construct and secure a pyramid. Partners need to support each other. Throughout assembly, whenever a tab is hidden, it must be lifted up and inserted into a nearby pocket.  a large model was generated by a pair of students.",16,mtms2011-10-180a,,
•	 Use	a	completed	model	to	show	 that each valley vertex will be surrounded by four pyramids.  inVestigating the oRigaMi Model,17,mtms2011-10-180a,,
"Who knew that an origami model would be so rich in mathematical content? I instructed the students to brainstorm with their group the geometry they saw in the model. I had not anticipated all the responses I received. After a brief group discussion, individual students were invited to go to the document camera and record their ideas. One by one, a steady stream of students listed the geometry they observed in the models. Initial notes included the terms triangles, pyramids, octahedron, right triangles, isosceles triangles, symmetry, 14 vertices, and 24 faces. See activity sheet 2.",18,mtms2011-10-180a,,
"A whole-class discussion enhanced the ideas. The terms pyramids became triangular pyramids. Triangles evolved into 24 congruent right isosceles  triangles. Octahedron was changed  to stellated octahedron, which led to a deeper discussion of an octahedron. I explained, “If you visualize chopping off the pyramids at their bases, you would have a polyhedron made of 8 congruent triangles.” A student conjectured that the triangles would  illustrated Folding instructions for a stellated octahedron",19,mtms2011-10-180a,,

"be equilateral. Just when I thought we had exhausted all the possible geometry associations, a male student conjectured that the interior angle measure totaled 2340 degrees. That conjecture inspired the class, because none of us had considered interior angle measure. We reasoned together  that the interior angle measure  could be calculated directly by  multiplying: 24 triangles × 180° per triangle = 4320°",22,mtms2011-10-180a,,
"With so much geometry saturating the model, students were intrigued to  learn that algebra connections can be found, as well. Students used conventional rulers to measure the base and height of the triangular faces to determine the area of each face. They multiplied the area of one triangle by 24 to find the total surface area. They were ready to transition to the  abstract. Activity sheet 2 includes the questions that led this discussion. When students were asked ",23,mtms2011-10-180a,,
"If the squares have side length x, what is the surface area of one model? a lengthy pause ensued. Students wavered as to how they might begin. After being given a hint to remove and unfold one of the modular pieces, students buckled down. They held the creased unfolded square piece of paper to the model, pinpointing a triangle congruent to a triangular face on the polyhedron. Most students used an area approach to determine that the area of one triangular face was equivalent to 1/16 the area of a single square piece of paper. Therefore, the surface area of the polyhedron was 24   16  x  square units, or (3/2)x 2 square units. We discussed why this was a surprising measurement. Although 12 congruent square papers were needed to construct one model, only 1.5 of those square papers were actually visible on the polyhedron’s surface. Students’ prior experience in modular origami prompted them to conclude that the rest of the paper was hidden for assembly and structural reasons. Following the brief whole-class discussion, students worked in groups to make discoveries and solve additional problems related to their models.  diFFicUlties stUdents encoUnteRed Undoubtedly,	the	biggest	mathematical challenge for students was determining the surface area of a model constructed from squares of side length x. When students unfolded a module and inspected it, the folded regions in the square (shown in ﬁ g. 1) were evident.",24,mtms2011-10-180a,,
a stellated octahedron was brought to class.,25,mtms2011-10-180a,,
"The larger (green) triangle in  ﬁ gure 1 is congruent to 24 congruent faces of the stellated octahedron. Students’ fraction sense and spatial reasoning helped them determine that 16 green triangles will cover the square. Therefore, if the square paper has side length x units, the area of one green triangle is (1/16)x 2 square units. ",26,mtms2011-10-180a,,
"Other students noticed that the  smaller (yellow) triangle is 1/32 of the square, so its area is (1/32)x 2 square units. Since two yellow triangles are required to cover a face of the origami model, the area of one face is (2/32)x 2 square units, or (1/16)x 2 square units.",27,mtms2011-10-180a,,
"It surprised me that no student implemented a more algebraic approach to determine the area of the larger (green) triangle. (See Darley’s [2009] discussion of number lines and algebraic reasoning.) If the side length of the square is x units, the base and height of the green triangle are (1/2)x and (1/4)x, respectively. Substituting those values into the formula for the area of a triangle, A = (1/2)bh, gives =  1 1 =A x x x       x  which simplifi es to A = (1/16)x 2 square units.",28,mtms2011-10-180a,,

"Deriving a formula for surface area of this modular origami model proved to be very diffi cult for students. Most understood that each triangular face was 1/16 the area of the square. Even (1/16)x2 square units as the area of one triangle was within students’ grasp. The challenge, however, was fi nding the surface area of the polyhedron while relying primarily on algebraic notation. Students who seemed over- whelmed could have simply counted and marked each of the 24 triangular faces of their model. For example, they could mark the fi rst triangular face and say, “(1/16)x 2,” then mark the next face and say, “(2/16)x 2, (3/16)x 2, . . .” until their last triangular face would reveal  extension ideas",30,mtms2011-10-180a,,
"This model lends itself to an independent study of the five Platonic solids and the thirteen archimedean solids. Students can construct these solids using paper or cardboard nets, Polydrons®, straws, and string.  •	 If	Platonic	solids	are	regular	polyhedra	and	Archimedean	solids	  are semiregular polyhedra, how might stellated polyhedra be  classified?  •	 Is	the	model	we	constructed	another	type	of	regular	polyhedra?	Why,	or	 why not? •	 Identify	the	vertex	configuration	for	each	of	the	Platonic	and	  archimedean solids. Do stellated polyhedra have unique vertex configurations? Why, or why not? •	 Consider	a	more	formal	investigation	of	Euler’s	formula	using	  two-dimensional doodle shapes as nonroutine sets of faces,  vertices, and edges.

"Revisiting origami with the stellated octahedron model was profitable for students. As Boakes (2009, p. 3) noted: ",33,mtms2011-10-180a,,
"By nature, Origami embodies these modalities—combining listening, watching, doing, and seeing with instruction. ",34,mtms2011-10-180a,,
"Visual	and	kinesthetic	learners,	auditory processors, and students with  high interpersonal or artistic intelligence thrive with origami. Questions prompting algebraic or numerical solutions will appeal to students of a wide range of mathematical abilities. All students’ spatial reasoning will be enhanced through paper folding. New life can be breathed into geometric concepts when students create their own models. Finally, students use a variety of approaches to investigate the surface area of a polyhedron, which is both challenging and rewarding. ",35,mtms2011-10-180a,,
