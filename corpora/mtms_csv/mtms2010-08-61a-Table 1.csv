"Although not intended for middle school students or teachers only, the third edition of Barron’s Dictionary of Mathematics Terms could easily serve as a reference for these two groups. ",2,mtms2010-08-61a,,
"This dictionary  gives the reader definitions for over  800 mathematics terms and includes illustrations for many of the terms, which aid understanding. Topics range from those appropriate for the middle school level, such as algebra, geometry, and statistics, to those that will serve students as they move to higher mathematics, such as trigonometry and calculus. Although the definitions are not as rigorous as those found in other math dictionaries, this one provides accurate, student-friendly definitions.",3,mtms2010-08-61a,,
"Also included for easy reference is a list of mathematical symbols and an appendix that provides key formulas for algebra, geometry, and trigonometry. One weakness is the lack of a pronunciation guide, something that other dictionaries provide. ",4,mtms2010-08-61a,,

"Although this book can serve middle school students as they continue to study math in high school and into college, it will also serve as a useful resource for middle school mathematics teachers, particularly those who teach varying content and levels, because this book spans both.  —Lorraine M.

"Danica McKellar, 2009. 331 pp., $15.00 paper. ISBN 978‑0‑452‑29540‑7. Penguin Group; www.penguin.com.",7,mtms2010-08-61a,,
"Kiss My Math hopes to make prealgebra both more palatable and more accessible to adolescent young women. To do so, examples in McKellar’s book are drawn from pop culture (e.g., Harry Potter and Zac Efron) and are placed in teenagerfriendly contexts (e.g., text messaging, dating, and chewing bubble gum). The topics explored are key to  the prealgebra curriculum—integers, exponents, inequalities, variables, and linear relationships. Pedagogically, an effort was made to get at the “whys” underlying many procedures. For instance, after offering a mathematical justification for exponent rules, the author states, “It sure is easier to follow the shortcuts, but it’s nice to know why they work” (p. 257).",8,mtms2010-08-61a,,
"That said, the book is not designed  for readers to use to investigate concepts and relationships for themselves. Rather, it can be used to guide readers  through examples that offer insights into given rules and procedures. ",9,mtms2010-08-61a,,
"McKellar provides an engaging way  for young women to think about pre- algebra as a topic that is relevant to their lives and interests. What makes it more than a dry mathematics textbook is the casual manner of speech used, the constant references to teenage-appropriate examples, and a healthy dose of “watch out” tips to avoid errors.",10,mtms2010-08-61a,,
"Some readers may bristle (and  others chuckle) at the often stereotypically gendered examples, but McKellar moves beyond the superficial to get her readers to consider how mathematics can empower them as people in terms of future academic goals and career choices. ",11,mtms2010-08-61a,,
"Since I am neither a teenager nor  a female, I asked a friend’s teenage daughter, Moriah, to share her perspective on this book, as well. Moriah admittedly thought math did suck in middle school and was often frustrated by prealgebra and algebra topics that seemed of little importance beyond their influence on one’s grade point average. What follows is her review: ",12,mtms2010-08-61a,,
"Horseback riding, dancing, musical  theater, cooking, reading. Do you see the word math in that list? I don’t think so. I am your average everyday teenager who in middle school thought math did suck. I became frustrated when I saw numbers and formulas and what seemed to be endless equations I could never make sense of. Although I always passed my math classes, it was never with a sense of “Yes, math, this is what is important!” ",13,mtms2010-08-61a,,
"In my opinion, the math “adventure” for most people begins with prealgebra when the curriculum goes beyond basic arithmetic—that’s when things can get really sticky. Now that I have fully  discouraged you from a math plan for middle schoolers, I do have a cure! ",14,mtms2010-08-61a,,
"Actually, Danica McKellar has the cure! She is sophisticated, witty, and, most important, a normal girl (aside from the fact that she was on The West Wing and The Wonder Years!). She wrote Kiss My Math, a sequel to her successful book Math Doesn’t Suck. In this book, she speaks specifically about integers, exponents, graphs, lines, equations, boys, and friends. Yes, you read correctly, I did say boys and friends. Aside from being a mathematically enhancing text, Kiss My Math gives real-life examples that relate to the lives of the typical sixth, seventh, or eighth grader. I know everyone remembers going through those times in middle school when math was not only hard but also plain uncool! ",15,mtms2010-08-61a,,
"I will be the first to admit that I didn’t want to be a math nerd! However, a quick look at this book shows you that girls who use math grow up to be women who are often very successful, like the finance director for Essence magazine. This and numerous other examples of women achieving because they are math smart helped me realize that this is something every girl should aim for. ",16,mtms2010-08-61a,,
"McKellar, who also shares social tips  for teens as a way to capture her readers’ attention, is really teaching math. For example, for concepts that might seem hard to grasp, McKellar puts them into a form that helps readers make a connection. For me, this works with her explanation of integers, which she transforms into “mintagers.” She explains that the negative mintagers give you progressively stronger stinky breath while positive mintagers help your breath smell better. If you combine −5 with 5, you can neutralize the effect to end up with 0 (or no change in your breath). It’s silly little connections like this that can help you remember correctly during a test. In later chapters, she talks about the dreaded word problem. But don’t fear. McKellar takes real-life situations, like talking on the phone, to help break down a problem in a way that makes it manageable and understandable. In the end, this approach is designed to encourage girls to do well in math. ",17,mtms2010-08-61a,,
"To support what you learn by reading, McKellar includes practice problems that you can do along with her or on your own. The answers are provided in the back of the book, with explanations on her Web site. I know that  when you grasp something in math, it feels great. ",18,mtms2010-08-61a,,
"I’m happy that Danica McKellar has  a book that finally places an emphasis on a subject that counts to everyone— girls, boys, women, and men. Her witty comments make learning math more engaging, which will help students really focus on what she has to say, including the math part. McKellar makes her readers feel empowered and smart, both when solving a math problem by drawing on a mnemonic device and when figuring out a social issue that involves dilemmas with boys. ",19,mtms2010-08-61a,,
"Her comments will make you laugh,  and her infusion of everyday teen life into math will leave you surprised by how much you have learned by the time you turn the last page.  —Mark Ellis, California State University−Fullerton, Fullerton, CA 92831 solving Word Problems for life, grades 6−8",20,mtms2010-08-61a,,

"Most teachers of middle school students realize that their students struggle with problem solving, and support in this area is  definitely needed. The focus of this resource is to provide a structured, scaffolded approach to solving problems to help struggling middle school students improve their skills. The structure is found in the format, which is presented as 180 separate “problems of the day.” These problems are presented within eleven units that each end with a quiz. The scaffolding is provided in the form of visual cues to remind students of which mathematical processes will be needed to solve the problems.",22,mtms2010-08-61a,,
"Although I agree with the overall  premise and think there is a need for such a resource, I have several concerns about this book. First, the quizzes that end each unit include the identical problems the students complete during the unit. A more effective assessment of whether the students are capable of working the word problems independently should include similar, not identical problems. ",23,mtms2010-08-61a,,
"I also have concerns with some  of the mathematical language in the resource. The author consistently uses the general term average when she is referring to mean. Also, the context and wording of the probability problems throughout this resource make them confusing and not mathematically sound. For example, one problem asks, “If he reaches into his suitcase, what are the chances he’ll find a pair of underwear?” Without specifying that he is randomly reaching in and selecting one item of clothing from the suitcase, this is not a valid probability question.",24,mtms2010-08-61a,,
"A final concern involves how to  best use this resource. The back cover states that the first 30 problems are sixth-grade standards, the next 30 are seventh-grade standards, and the last 30 are eighth-grade standards, but there are 180 problems in the resource. It appears that this resource is meant to be used as a daily problem of the day for sixth- through eighth-grade students, but the content of some may be difficult for sixth graders, especially early in the school year.",25,mtms2010-08-61a,,
"Although I believe there is a need  for this type of resource, I would recommend some changes to both the format and the content so that it is both mathematically accurate and more classroom ready for any grade level (6−8).",26,mtms2010-08-61a,,

April 2010’s “Palette of Problems”,28,mtms2010-08-61a,,
Problem 4 on p. 438 reads:  4. I am a prime number greater than 100 and less than 1000. Each of my digits is also a prime. I am the smallest prime number such that the difference between my hundreds digit and ones digit is positive. What number am I?,29,mtms2010-08-61a,,
The solution is 523.,30,mtms2010-08-61a,,
"Problem 10 on p. 439 should have read: 10. If C and D are positive numbers and C is 30 percent more than D, then C – D is what percent of C?",31,mtms2010-08-61a,,
"The solution follows: 10. Since C is 30% more than D, C = 1D + 0.30D = 1.3D. Therefore, C – D = 1.3D – 1D = 0.3D. To find the percent, construct and simplify this ratio:",32,mtms2010-08-61a,,
So C − D is approximately 23.1% of C.,33,mtms2010-08-61a,,
