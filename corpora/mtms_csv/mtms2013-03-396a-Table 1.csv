"The attributes of simple, easy, and efﬁ cient have been embraced and promoted in our daily lives, especially in commercial products such as cell phones, iPods®, televisions, cars, and so on. These attributes gradually penetrate other levels of our society, such as learning and teaching, for both students and teachers. Students ask for simple, easy, and efﬁ cient methods for performing mathematics; teachers simplify instruction by eliminating proofs or reasoning and convey efﬁ cient shortcuts, tips, or packed procedures for different types of problems. This article discusses how simplicity, ease, and efﬁ ciency kill reasoning and require little brain activity. Another consequence of embracing simplicity and efﬁ ciency is that skills are characterized as technical manipulations and operations. Four approaches to restoring reasoning in teachers’ instruction and students’ learning are described.",12,mtms2013-03-396a,,

HAS SIMPLICITY KILLED REASONING?,14,mtms2013-03-396a,,
"How do the attributes of simple, easy, and efﬁ cient kill mathematical reasoning? Let’s consider some examples. A simple and easy-to-remember rule when multiplying 3-2 × 3-3 is that you add exponents because the two terms have the same base and obtain the answer of 3-5. Students tend to have no problem understanding and applying this rule. The problem is how to make sense of the procedure. How many students can make sense of why we add −2 + −3? Based on my teaching experience, only a few students know why. What is concealed in the rule is the reasoning, shown in ﬁ gure 1, in which the exponential terms are written as fractions and then multiplied. ",15,mtms2013-03-396a,,
"One probably would argue that the reasoning is too long, too timeconsuming, not easy to remember, and too complicated. There is no need to repeat it every time when solving similar problems. Really? Do we know its beneﬁ t if we repeat it frequently? In fact, I have seen many students (sometimes, as many as half my students) repeating the same mistake, saying 22 × 23 is equal to 26 by applying some simple, easy, and efﬁ cient “rules” or “skills.” ",16,mtms2013-03-396a,,
"As another example, consider how  many students can make sense of 2 × 3 when evaluating × , which equals 1/6. The “rule” or “skill” is to multiply the numerators together and the denominators together when multiplying two fractions. However, where is the reasoning? Almost all the college students I have taught do not know why. First, 1/2 × 1/3 can be interpreted as 1/2 divided by 3 or as 1/2 shared among 3 persons. Something shared among 3 means that the item is divided into 3 parts. Therefore, the thing that is divided into 2 parts already is again divided into 3 parts. Consequently, the partition is 2 × 3 = 6 parts. ",17,mtms2013-03-396a,,
"This reasoning also exists in the  multiplication of the two fractions 4/5 and 2/3, which means that the partition is changed from 3 to 15 if considering as as × × .",18,mtms2013-03-396a,,
×4 ×4,19,mtms2013-03-396a,,
"Multiplying 2/3 × 1/5 means that a quantity divided into 3 parts is divided by 5 again or that each part of the 3 parts is divided into 5 parts again. Therefore, the partition is 3 × 5 = 15. The meaning of  15 is that 2/15 is added to itself 4 times, which is 15 15 15 15 = (222 15 15 3× 3× 3× 32 32 32 32 32 32 32",20,mtms2013-03-396a,,
"Fig. 1 In performing this simpliﬁ cation, many underlying understandings are applied.",21,mtms2013-03-396a,,
"The reasoning may be long, complicated, time-consuming, and difﬁ cult. However, the reasoning above makes sense of the multiplication of the denominators and the numerators. Indeed, it would be faster to just multiply the numerators and denominators together to get  4 2×4 2 4 2 5 3×5 3 5 3 15",22,mtms2013-03-396a,,
"One may say let students know how ﬁ rst and they will know why later when they grow up or when a teacher explores the topic in later grades. Really? The problem in fact is not about whether we will teach students why in their later grades but rather that we are teaching students a habit of simple, easy, and efﬁ cient mathematics practice that is full of gaps between how and why. In other words, we are teaching without reasoning. Therefore, reasoning is killed. ",23,mtms2013-03-396a,,
"Many easy, simple, and efﬁ cient “rules” or “skills” have been created in school mathematics that dismiss reasoning and create gaps between how and why, which lead students to manipulate rather than reason with numbers and symbols. Examples include— •  “canceling out” or “cross canceling out” numerators and denominators of fractions or the product of fractions; •  using cross multiplication with a  proportion; •  counting decimal places for the  location of the decimal point in the multiplication of decimals; •  using algorithms of column addition, subtraction, multiplication, and long division; and  3         = (two 1/3s1/3s1/ multiplied tdd td ogether) = iive 1/3s1/3s1/ multiplied together   = −   (three 1/3s1/3s1/ multiplied together) •  using algorithms to add and subtract  fractions, multiply fractions, transform equations, and translate word problems.",24,mtms2013-03-396a,,
REDEEM REASONING,25,mtms2013-03-396a,,
"Reasoning derives from understanding the meaning of (1) numbers and symbols, (2) properties and rules, (3) procedures, and (4) methods. The following illustrate how we can restore reasoning in these four phases of mathematics. ",26,mtms2013-03-396a,,
Making Sense of Numbers and Symbols,27,mtms2013-03-396a,,
"Misconceptions or mistakes can happen in the early stages of mathematical learning when fundamental entities, such as the meaning of numbers, symbols, number sentences, or algebraic expressions, are created and deﬁ ned. For instance, mistakes that students often make when simplifying the algebraic expression 2x + 3 + 5x result in  10x, 3 + 7x 2, 3 + 10x, or 3 + 10x 2. ",28,mtms2013-03-396a,,
"These kinds of mistakes usually occur because students are not making a connection to fundamental entities (e.g., symbols and variable terms).",29,mtms2013-03-396a,,
"One way to avoid such mistakes is  to show students the reasoning that connects the operations and the deﬁ nition of the three terms. For example, a teacher can discuss the expression 2x + 3 + 5x as follows: ",30,mtms2013-03-396a,,
"It means that two x, one 3, and ﬁ ve x are added, which is also asking how many x and numbers there are in total. Thus, there are 7x in total, and one 3. Can we add 7x and 3 to get 10x? Why can’t they be added together to total 10x? We have seven x, and do not know the exact value of x, so 7x  is unknown. Therefore, the best we can do is to just state the total as 7x + 3.",31,mtms2013-03-396a,,
"For students, reasoning is the coupling of the deﬁ nition of deﬁ ned entities with the basic operations on the entities.",32,mtms2013-03-396a,,
Making Sense of Properties and Rules,33,mtms2013-03-396a,,
"Isolated rules or properties that are not connected to their roots (e.g., definitions) are often misused or wrongly applied. For example, the addition property of equality states that the equality in an equation is held when adding the same number to both sides of the equation. The property is often used by students when simplifying algebraic expressions, such as multiplying the expression  +2 x+ x+ 2 2 x2 x2 x2 x2 by",34,mtms2013-03-396a,,
"Students also make a common mistake when performing the distributive law on 3(4x – 2). They multiply 3 and 4x only, which results in 12x – 2, or they  do not address the negative sign, which results in 12x + 6. When the reasoning between properties and their roots is absent, properties are easily misused because of the loss of context.",35,mtms2013-03-396a,,
"To avoid the misuse of rules and  properties, it may help to explain multiplication by showing the use of the distributive law based on the deﬁ nition of parentheses. For example, the operation 3(4x – 2) means that three times a group of terms is enclosed by the parentheses; in other words, three times the quantity 4x – 2. There are three groups of 4x – 2. When the parentheses are removed and the commutative and associative properties engaged, (4x – 2) + (4x – 2) + (4x – 2) can be rearranged to (4x + 4x + 4x) + (−2 + −2 + −2).",36,mtms2013-03-396a,,
"Therefore, we have 3 times each of the terms 4x and –2, or 3(4x) + 3(–2), or 12x – 6.",37,mtms2013-03-396a,,
"For students, reasoning is the coupling of the deﬁ nition of properties with the use of properties or rules.",38,mtms2013-03-396a,,
"Making Sense of Procedure A simpliﬁ ed procedure that skips or combines steps could cause students to miss the connection between rules or properties. Without understanding the connection between the rules or the properties, mathematics could become simply machine-like manipulation and operation. For example, one may simplify by “canceling out 4 and 2” by crossing out 4 and 2 and replacing 4 with 2, and “canceling out both y” by crossing ",39,mtms2013-03-396a,,
"Mathematics could become simply machine-like manipulations and operations without understanding the connection between the rules or the properties.  out y on the top and bottom of the fraction. The answer is the left term, which is 2. The term cancel out used in the procedure is, in fact, not mathematically correct. ",40,mtms2013-03-396a,,
What is missed is the reasoning. ,41,mtms2013-03-396a,,
"In the simpliﬁ ed procedure above, the rule of reduction by dividing 4 and 2 by the same number 2 (or the rule of division, dividing 4 by 2) is missing. Similar rules are applied to the two y terms. Furthermore, the principle behind the reduction is the equivalence of fractions, and the idea behind the division is the deﬁ nition of fractions.",42,mtms2013-03-396a,,
"A complete reasoning used to  simplify 4y/2y is illustrated in ﬁ gure 2. The reasoning necessary is the inference from the use of one property or rule to the use of another property or rule without gaps. Showing students the connection among properties, rules, and deﬁ nitions may change the typical conception of mathematics as machine-like or rote manipulation.",43,mtms2013-03-396a,,
Making Sense of Methods,44,mtms2013-03-396a,,
"Introducing a method for solving some problems without giving its rationale or purpose will result in a packed procedure, in which a student  follows a series of steps with no regard for their meaning. The problem with packed procedures is that, without students knowing why, they usually apply a method to the wrong problems or for the wrong purpose. For example, some students apply the idea or method of multiplying fractions by their common denominator to get rid of or simplify fractions. However, this method serves different purposes in solving equations (e.g., get rid of fractions) and in simplifying rational expressions (e.g., turn a complex fraction, the division of two fractions, into a simpler fraction), which, consequently, involve different procedures.",45,mtms2013-03-396a,,
"Without knowing the different purposes, some students make the mistake of using the method and its subsequent procedure to get rid of fractions in an equation and to simplify an algebraic expression. For example, students often multiply “both sides” by x + 1 when trying to simplify the rational expression +2 x+ x+ 2 2 x2 x2 x2 x2",46,mtms2013-03-396a,,
"Apparently, it is a mismatch of procedure. There is no “both sides” for an algebraic expression. The reasoning behind the method is the different purposes of equation solving and of simplifying algebraic expressions, as ",47,mtms2013-03-396a,,
Fig. 2 The complete reasoning used to simplify the rational expression is the inference from the use of one property or rule to the use of another property or rule without gaps.,48,mtms2013-03-396a,,

If the connections are not explained and not emphasized, but instead shortcuts, tips, and simpliﬁ ed or packed procedures are promoted, then the development of skills will move toward rote symbolic manipulation.

If these ideas are the reasons to create or use shortcuts, tips, and simpliﬁ ed or packed procedures to solve problems, which dismiss connections among deﬁ nitions, properties, rules, and problem-solving methods, then they do kill reasoning. To restore reasoning is to restore the connections within skills for solving problems.",52,mtms2013-03-396a,,
"If we represent the development  of skills as a continuum, then the extremes would be rote symbolic manipulation on one end and proof on the other (see ﬁ g. 3). If the connections  well as the rationales for their subsequent procedures (for achieving the purposes). For example, to get rid of fractions (the purpose) in solving the equation + =+ = , one may use the multiplication property of equations (the rationale) to multiply both sides of the equation by the common denominator of the fractions (8) in the equation (the procedure). Similarly, to simplify the complex rational expression t 1+ ÷÷÷ (the purpose), one may use the property of equivalent fractions (the rationale) to multiply the numerator and denominator of the overall complex rational expression by the common denominator of the overall numerator and denominator (t + 1).
