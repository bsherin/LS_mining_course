"Ratio, rate, and proportion have been treated traditionally as interrelated topics in these ways: (a) a ratio as a quotient of two quantities, (b) a rate as a ratio with different kinds of measures,  and (c) a proportion as an equivalence of two ratios. Instead of making connections between ratios and proportions, many students tend to focus on the techniques for solving ratio-comparison tasks (e.g., Which is a better buy: 16 oz. of mixed nuts for $6.00 or 10 oz. for $3.25?) and missing-value tasks (e.g., 16 oz. of mixed nuts costs $6.00; how much would 10 oz. cost?). Consequently, students tend to rely too much on techniques for proportional tasks to solve arithmetic word problems that are presented in a missingvalue format. For example, Cramer, Post, and Currier (1993) observed  that thirty-two out of thirty-three preservice teachers in a mathematics methods class apply the proportion algorithm to solve this problem: ",6,mtms2009-04-492a,,

"These preservice teachers set up a proportion, such as 9/3 = x/15, which is conceptually more difficult than the correct additive approach of 9 – 3 = x – 15, or 15 – 3 = x – 9. Hence, “we cannot define a proportional reasoner as simply one who knows how to set up and solve a proportion” (Cramer, Post, and Currier 1993, p. 160).",8,mtms2009-04-492a,,
"To deeply understand proportional  reasoning, students must be able to differentiate proportional situations from nonproportional situations. Unfortunately, the emphasis on the use of proportional strategies in middlegrades mathematics has led students to develop a disposition to associate certain characteristics of problem formulation with the use of proportional strategies. Van Dooren et al. (2005) found that the use of proportional strategies to solve a constant-difference running problem, similar to the problem described above, was highest among sixth and seventh graders, as compared with third, fourth, fifth, and eighth graders, in Belgium.

"Feinstein (1979) has cautioned  about the danger of overgeneralization in mathematics and argued that “to enable students to discriminate effectively, several ‘nonexamples’ must be included in their experiences” (p. 22). Discriminating effectively requires students to understand the structural differences between proportional and nonproportional situations. Lamon (2007) proposes that “proportional reasoning means supplying reasons in support of  claims made about the structural relationships among four quantities, (say a, b, c, d) in a context simultaneously involving covariance [italics added] of quantities and invariance [italics added] of ratios or products” (p. 638).

"burning rate is constant, or invariant, the ratio x/50 should also be equal to 0.6 mm/min. Hence, the two ratios should be equal to each other, specifically, x/50 = 12/20. Solving this proportion will determine that x = 30. ",23,mtms2009-04-492a,,
"If all the missing-value problems that students encounter involve proportional situations, then checking the equivalence of two ratios in a proportion soon becomes redundant and counterproductive. Nonproportional situations must occasionally be incorporated into students’ problem-solving experience to instill the habit of checking whether two quantities are indeed covarying in a proportional manner. A missing-value problem (part a  of each task in fig. 1) can be designed with quantities that vary so that a specific relationship between them remains invariant. For example, the ratio between the two varying quantities in a proportional situation, such as task 1 or task 5, is invariant. Alternatively, the two quantities may covary such that their sum (task 2), their product (task 3), or their difference (task 4) is invariant. ",24,mtms2009-04-492a,,
"Using a single context for all the tasks in figure 1 highlights the fact that a typical missing-value problem whose quantities vary proportionally can be rewritten so that quantities vary according to a constant sum, product, or difference. In task 2, the original height of the candle is invariant, although its value in unknown. At any moment in time, the sum of the length of candle burned, x, and the height of the candle, h, should equal its original height. Hence, 30 + 75 =  h + x for 0 ≤ h ≤ 105 and 0 ≤ x ≤ 105. In task 3, the duration of the festival is invariant. Since 24 candles, lasting 7 hours each, are needed, the festival should last 24 × 7 hrs., which equals 168 hours, or 1 week. In general,  n candles × t hours/candle should be equal to 168 hours. Hence, 21 × 7 = n × t, where n is a natural number.  fig. 2  A student’s work depicting use of a proportion to solve both task 4a and  task 5a  student A’s solution to task 4a                student A’s solution to task 5a (a)  (b) fig. 3  A student’s work depicting use of an additive strategy for both task 4a and  task 5a  student b’s solution to task 4a  student b’s solution to task 5a (a) (b) fig. 4 A student’s work depicting correct solutions for task 4a and task 5a student C’s solution to task 4a  student C’s solution to task 5a (a) (b) fig. 5 An activity to identify quantities and covariations in task 5",25,mtms2009-04-492a,,

"Task 4 and task 5 seem similar, and they both involve 2 burning candles. Since the candles in task 4 are burning at the same rate but are lit at different times, the difference between the burned lengths of candle A and candle B is constant. Because the candles in task 5 are lit at the same time but are burning at different rates, the ratio of the burned length of candle P to the burned length of candle Q is invariant.  preservice teachers’ responses to two  Missing-value proBleMs",32,mtms2009-04-492a,,
"Tasks 4a and 5a were used in a mathematics course for preservice teachers of grades 4−8. The goal was to necessitate an analysis of the two problems to understand why a proportional solution is applicable for task 5 but not task 4. The preservice teachers were asked to show their work and submit their solutions. Afterward, they discussed their solution to tasks 4a and 5a in small groups before a whole-class discussion.",33,mtms2009-04-492a,,
"On the basis of their written  responses, few preservice teachers noticed the structural difference between the two tasks. Task 4 is an additive situation in which the difference of 8 mm is constant, whereas task 5 is a proportional situation in which the ratio of 1.6 is constant. In their written response, twenty-three of twenty-eight participants used the same approach for the two tasks. Seventeen students used a proportional strategy for both tasks; thirteen students set up a proportion and solved for the missing value; and four students used a unit ratio strategy, as shown in figure 2. Five students used an additive strategy for both tasks (see fig. 3). One student used an incorrect strategy involving division for both tasks; another used a unit ratio strategy for task 4a and wrote “not enough information to determine how fast candle P is burning” for task 5a. Only four students appropriately used an additive strategy  for task 4a and a proportional strategy for task 5a (see fig. 4). ",34,mtms2009-04-492a,,
"Although more preservice teachers  obtained the correct answer for task 5a than for task 4a, they appeared to have greater difficulty with conceptual understanding of the solution for task 5a than for task 4a. None of the students who used a proportional strategy for task 5a explained the meaning of the ratio 16/10 or the ratio 35/10 in their written response. The lack of explanation among students was possibly a consequence of being asked to show their work; they were not explicitly asked to explain their work. From my experience, preservice teachers generally do not pay close attention to the meaning of ratios when they set up a proportion to solve a missingvalue problem.",35,mtms2009-04-492a,,
"On the other hand, students who used an additive strategy for task 4a seemed to have a referential meaning for the 18 mm difference (see fig. 3) or the 8 mm difference (see fig. 4). When one student explained her solution for task 4a, most of her classmates could understand why the “difference” method works. However, they could not explain what was wrong with using a proportion to solve task 4a, and why proportions such as 16/10 = x/35 or 35/10 = x/16 could be used for task 5a. At that juncture, many students seemed to need further explanation.",36,mtms2009-04-492a,,
"Seeking to understand the structural difference between task 4 and task 5 was not a habit of mind that these preservice teachers had. One preservice teacher even inquired about the use of key words, such as “burning at the same rate” and “lighted at the same time,” to decide between an additive strategy and a proportional strategy. To understand why the conditions in task 5 make the situation proportional, one needs to visualize the constantly changing heights of the two burning candles and mentally  fig. 6 A teacher’s drawing to illustrate the problem situation for task 2a and for  task 3a   (a) (b) fig. 7 A teacher’s chart to highlight the two ratios in task 1 2.5",37,mtms2009-04-492a,,

The first question of each task in figure 1 is appropriate for sixth- to eighth-grade mathematics students. ,41,mtms2009-04-492a,,
"Part b of each question, however,  must not be used prematurely. Students must first be given ample “opportunities to explore situations in which they have to reason explicitly in terms of quantities and quantitative relationships” (Sowder et al. 1998, p. 131). In undertaking a quantitative  analysis of the problem situation, students identify the quantities in  the problem and the relationships among the quantities. The activity in figure 5 is designed deliberately for students to identify quantities and relationships, as well as to differentiate among givens, unknowns, and variables. This activity helps students build their capacity to visualize covariation of quantities in a problem. Whenever possible, students, as  well as teachers, should mentally act out the problem situation and draw diagrams to depict the problem situation. In figure 4a, a student drew two number lines to coordinate the burned lengths of candle A and candle B for task 4a. Since the candles in task 5a are burning at different rates, the student had to create a chart to coordinate the burned length of candle P with that of candle Q. The diagrams in figures 6a and 6b were drawn by  fig. 8 burned length versus time graphs for task 4a fig. 9 burned length versus time graphs for task 5a in-service middle school teachers working on task 2a and 3a. They illustrate how diagrams can help students understand the problem situation and determine the invariant, or constant, quantity where the original height of the candle is invariant (in task 2a) and when the duration of the festival is invariant (in task 3a). Another teacher used a diagram (see fig. 7) to highlight two different multiplicative relationships among the four quantities (20 min., 50 min., 12 mm, and the answer of 30 mm) in task 1. These explanations were given:  1.  The ratio of 3/5 refers to the  invariant burning rate: “No matter how long the candle has been burning, it will always burn 3/5 mm per minute until the candle no longer exists.”  2.  The ratio of 2.5 is a multiplicative comparison: 50 minutes is 2.5 × 20 min., so the answer of 30 mm is also 2.5 × 12 mm, because the candle burns 12 mm every 20 minutes.",42,mtms2009-04-492a,,
"Activities can also be designed  for students to represent the covariation between two varying quantities graphically and interpret those graphs meaningfully (see figs. 8 and 9). For example, the difference in vertical intercepts in figure 8 can be interpreted as the 8 mm head start that candle A has over candle B. Students can also practice making connections between the problem situation and its graphic representation. Doing so, they will recognize that the ratio of candle P’s burning rate to candle Q’s burning rate corresponds to the ratio of the slopes of the two lines in figure 9. ",43,mtms2009-04-492a,,
"Students should be challenged to reason algebraically whenever the opportunity arises. For example, students may be asked to show why the ratio of the burning rate of candle P to that of candle Q is 1.6. The proof, as a constraint that forces the values of the quantities to vary in a particular manner according to an invariant relationship that is specific to the problem situation. Some students may even realize that if the equation relating burned length, y, and time, x,  k is the burning rate for candle Q, then the equation for candle P is y = 1.6kx (see fig. 9), because the candles were burning at different rates but lit at the same time.

"Discriminating effectively requires students to understand the structural differences between proportional and nonproportional situations for candle B is y = mx, where m is the burning rate for candle B, then the equation for candle A is y = mx + 8 (see fig. 8) because the candles were burning at the same rate but lit at different times. Likewise, if the equation for candle Q is y = kx, where  the slope of a line and the burning rate of a candle as well as the association between the x-intercept and the time at which the candle is lit. Students’ algebraic reasoning can be strengthened from investigating the covariation of quantities in these  requires students to pay attention to the time quantity. By explicitly identifying the time T1 between the moment the candles were lit and  the first moment, denoted by T1 in figure 9, students can reinforce their understanding of rate as a quantity whose value is equal to the ratio of two other quantities.
