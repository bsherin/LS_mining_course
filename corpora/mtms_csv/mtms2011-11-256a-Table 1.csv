The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)’s new diagram of its dietary guidelines (http://www.choose myplate.gov/index.html) is a pie chart. It does not place a preferential order on types of foods but instead suggests a balance of foods. ,2,mtms2011-11-256a,,
"The plate can be a bit confusing: Half of the plate is fruits and vegetables, but when dairy is added, fruits and vegetables are no longer half. It is also difficult to determine how grains and proteins relate to each other—grains are clearly more than half of the protein and grain portion of the plate.",3,mtms2011-11-256a,,
"proBleMs 1.  Assume that fruits and vegetables divide the plate’s diameter into a 4:5 ratio (as do protein and grains).  a. What is the ratio of their areas?    b. On the basis of (a), what percent  of the entire plate is vegetables (not counting dairy)? What percent of the entire plate is fruits? 2.  When the dairy plate is combined  with the entire plate, dairy takes about 12% of the area. Using that fact, about how much of the total percent of daily calorie intake should be in— a. vegetables? b. protein? c. dairy? ",4,mtms2011-11-256a,,
