Some jokes are more suitable for individuals with some background knowledge. It is improbable that elementary students will appreciate that “graphing rational functions is a pain in the asymptote.” The context and content of each joke should always be judged for appropriateness. ,1,mtms2011-02-382a,,

"empowering the Mentor of the Beginning Mathematics teacher Gwen Zimmermann, Patricia Guinee, Linda M. Fulmore, and Elizabeth Murray, eds., 2009. 69 pp., $22.95 paper. Stock no. 13477. ISBN 978‑ 0‑87353‑620‑2. National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,  www.nctm.org. ",6,mtms2011-02-382a,,
"Too often, enthusiastic new mathematics teachers find themselves overwhelmed and isolated, which causes the most disillusioned of them to leave the profession entirely. A good mentor can make all the difference. Balancing a variety of roles that include sounding board, cheerleader, colleague, collaborator, procurer of supplies, and interpreter of acronyms, a mentor eases stress and offers guidance while leading a colleague through unfamiliar territory. Ideally, this relationship benefits all involved. New teachers feel supported; mentors can, by association, learn about the latest instructional methods ",7,mtms2011-02-382a,,

"But how does such a synergistic relationship develop? How does a mentor determine how to help, when to help, and how much to help? That is the focus of this NCTM publication. A compilation of brief articles by mathematics teachers at all levels, Empowering the Mentor offers anecdotes, suggestions, warnings, checklists, questions to consider, and research results for optimizing the mentor-mentee relationship. ",9,mtms2011-02-382a,,
"Far from presenting a step-by-step, how-to recipe, Empowering the Mentor acknowledges the complexity inherent in the mentoring relationship. Although the book loosely groups its articles by topic, each article could stand-alone. In other words, the chapters do not need to be read in order. ",10,mtms2011-02-382a,,

This book and CD package provides a complete unit for middle-grades students studying the volume and surface area of rectangular solids. ,19,mtms2011-02-382a,,
"The use of graphic-novel-style readings called “comics,” instructional video clips called “animations,” and authentic measurement experiences make this an extremely useful product for engaging middle school students in the study of rectangular solids.",20,mtms2011-02-382a,,
"Each of the five lessons introduce  students to the day’s objective with a comic that explains the topic and  important terms in a brief and appealing way. The comics come in slide form or as printable PDFs. Investigations include making a net from cereal boxes that students bring from home, cutting and assembling nets from six rectangles, and sketching “boxy buildings” on isometric drawing paper. Students fill the boxes they create with linking cubes to calculate volume; their use of isometric paper to draw reinforces the vocabulary of vertices, edges, and faces.",21,mtms2011-02-382a,,
"Students sketch and record their  investigations on student worksheets, also included in PDF format on the CD. Each lesson includes a “video help” clip for the teacher, which provides an overview of the lesson, demonstrations, and important ideas to emphasize. A glossary of terms and a review of the mathematics being taught (“The Story of Measurement of Rectangular Solids”) make this  material easy for new teachers to use.",22,mtms2011-02-382a,,
"The material is appropriate for fifth-grade and sixth-grade lessons, and for seventh-grade and eighthgrade students for remedial or review work. The assessments at the end of the unit would make good pieces for fifth-grade and sixth-grade math portfolios.",23,mtms2011-02-382a,,
