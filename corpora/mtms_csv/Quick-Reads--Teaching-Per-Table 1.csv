3,Quick Reads: Teaching Perseverance through Differentiated Homework,"All teachers want students to work hard and push through difficult problems on their own. Students who are working in cooperative groups can rely on one another for help during the school day, but what happens when they are alone at home doing their homework? For several years, I have been refining a differentiated homework system that I have found to be quite successful at teaching perseverance. This idea of perseverance has become a national focus with the recent adoption of the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics in forty-five states (CCSSI 2010). But why the attention to perseverance?",3,Quick Reads: Teaching Perseverance through Differentiated Homework
4,Quick Reads: Teaching Perseverance through Differentiated Homework,"In this digital age, in which  students gravitate toward immediate gratification through social media, academic success and success in general are best achieved by developing the skills that maintain focus in solving complex and unfamiliar problems.

It requires finding the learning edge of each student and then giving him or her ample time to work out and reflect on appropriately challenging problems. Differentiation has traditionally been used in the context of classroom instructional techniques that modify the content, process, product, or learning environment to meet the needs of each student (Tomlinson 2000). However, I suggest that this idea can be broadened to include homework assignments. ",5,Quick Reads: Teaching Perseverance through Differentiated Homework
6,Quick Reads: Teaching Perseverance through Differentiated Homework,"At the beginning of each school year, the incoming students at our school take the Measures of Academic Progress (MAP) test to ascertain the grade level for which they are instructionally ready (NWEA 2012). State testing results are an option for schools not using the MAP test.

12,Quick Reads: Teaching Perseverance through Differentiated Homework,"Level A problems are those bare- bones essential tasks that are necessary to understand the current concepts. Level C problems include most level A problems but also incorporate additional items and problems connecting to previous and future concepts. Level E problems usually substitute some of the level A problems for high  school-level tasks. At the midyear, I reassess, make changes to homework levels when appropriate, and encourage students to work above their assigned level if they so desire. By assigning each student to a homework level, I challenge students, although during the fall months I am still getting to know my students.

I suggest that students read the problems often during the week. If difficulties arise, students are welcome to ask for additional help, explanations, or directions during their study hall, but I refrain from giving the answers. Weekly after-school help sessions are offered in which students can work with peer tutors in a more intimate setting. By allowing an entire week to complete homework assignments, I give students multiple opportunities to seek help and revisit problems.",29,Quick Reads: Teaching Perseverance through Differentiated Homework
30,Quick Reads: Teaching Perseverance through Differentiated Homework,"During the first five minutes of each class, students check in with their group mates regarding any questions they have thus far. During this time, I walk around and stamp each student’s homework, indicating progress. I require at least one stamp on each student’s homework before the due date to dissuade students from completing the entire assignment over the weekend, when no help is available. In addition, students learn to prioritize their schedules and start taking responsibility for long-range planning.",30,Quick Reads: Teaching Perseverance through Differentiated Homework
31,Quick Reads: Teaching Perseverance through Differentiated Homework,"Finally, when the homework is  due, each student is given an answer key and is required to correct his or her homework in red pen before self-assessment and my grading. This  answer-key check provides immediate feedback to students and an opportunity for me to gain insight into their mistakes. If someone does not understand a problem at that point or cannot make sense of the answer key, he or she can then ask for help. This is when my feedback makes the most sense. Homework is graded primarily on effort, including the effort expended in making corrections. Students learn that it is okay to take risks and fail, but it is not okay to write “IDK  [I don’t know]” on their work.",31,Quick Reads: Teaching Perseverance through Differentiated Homework
32,Quick Reads: Teaching Perseverance through Differentiated Homework,"This system has been a work in progress over the past three years. I have made mistakes and learned from them, such as trying to boost all students to at least a level C, except for those with certain learning disabilities. Frequently, however, frustrations arose and tears were shed. If students are operating at a lower grade level, then simply assigning them “at grade level” work can be too challenging, and perseverance is lost. I feel that this system promotes perseverance when following through on these items: 1.
