6,Classroom Strategies to Make Sense and Persevere,"Three middle-level mathematics teachers (grades 7 and 8) and a university mathematics educator formed a yearlong professional learning community (PLC) (DuFour, DuFour, and Eaker 2008). The objective was to collectively look at how we were promoting the Standards for Mathematical Practice (SMP) (CCSSI 2010) in our classes. Our monthly discussions followed an iterative cycle in which we continually shared instructional strategies and discussed their effectiveness in helping our students demonstrate the SMP (see fi g. 1). We followed the ",6,Classroom Strategies to Make Sense and Persevere

8,Classroom Strategies to Make Sense and Persevere,"As a team, we discussed which instructional strategies were effective and why they were effective in helping our students become more aware of their mathematical practice behaviors. In some cases, an instructional strategy needed to be enhanced  or modifi ed to promote more explicit use of the practices by students. For example, we decided to use the strategy of emphasizing perseverance themes and discussions in every class. In one meeting, we shared that simply discussing perseverance was not enough. Therefore, we decided to have our students keep a perseverance log (described later in the article). We found this iterative cycle helpful in guiding our discussions on enhancing the use of the math practices. ",8,Classroom Strategies to Make Sense and Persevere

28,Classroom Strategies to Make Sense and Persevere,"How do we get students to reread a problem and check their answer to see if it makes sense? Although we often remind students to do just that, as well as check their answer using a different method, our students tended to rush through a problem just to say, “Done!” without revisiting the answer or the question posed. To show students the benefi ts of checking their answer to see if it makes sense, teacher A scanned student answers (without student names) to open-ended questions from the prealgebra curriculum and put them into a PowerPoint® presentation. Class time was used by students to look at each answer and analyze why the solution did not make sense. Students discussed what a reasonable answer might be and the possible errors that may have been made that resulted in the incorrect answer. The teacher also asked the students to share possible strategies to fi nd the solution. The following conversation occurred in the class when the teacher discussed problem A (see fi g. 2a).",28,Classroom Strategies to Make Sense and Persevere

This strategy is helpful for students who are solving multiple-choice-type problems, such as those often found on state assessments. We wanted to use the POE strategy to help students think about and identify  possible versus impossible solutions.

74,Classroom Strategies to Make Sense and Persevere,"Our third strategy began by explicitly teaching students what it means to persevere and how to track and evaluate their progress. We created a Perseverance theme for our classrooms and shared examples of famous individuals and how and where perseverance paid off. For example, we explored Thomas Edison’s quote, “I have not failed. I just have 10,000 ways that won’t work” (www.goodreads.com), and discussed his attempts at inventing the lightbulb. We also touched on Milton Hershey’s work to create a chocolate company. We wanted to emphasize to students that perseverance means sticking with it and not giving up. We also wanted to help them realize that concentrated effort and deep thinking are rewarding. Therefore, we focused on their successes when they exhibited the behavior of sticking with problems.",74,Classroom Strategies to Make Sense and Persevere
75,Classroom Strategies to Make Sense and Persevere,"For this strategy, we selected open- ended problems that addressed the Common Core’s standards for mathematical content. While they worked on these problems, we required our  algebra 1 students to analyze the givens, constraints, relationships, and goals, as described in SMP 1. We asked students to keep a log describing how they persevered to solve problems and what they learned from the problems. We allowed them to work with a partner to discuss the givens and constraints, how they should be considered in the problem, and to share solution strategies. For example, students were presented with the problem in figure 3, which addressed the Common Core high school standard, “Solve linear equations and  behaviors resulted? mathematical behaviors are  expected?",75,Classroom Strategies to Make Sense and Persevere

The teacher posed questions to pairs of students to help scaffold their thinking about the constraints for the values of x. She asked one pair, “What does ‘at most’ mean in the problem?” and “How would you represent ‘at most’ in mathematical form?” She wanted them to think about this question as she moved on to query another pair of students. The teacher continually reminded students to be sure they persevered and checked their solutions.",79,Classroom Strategies to Make Sense and Persevere
80,Classroom Strategies to Make Sense and Persevere,"To review the problem, the teacher selected one pair of students to share their work at the board and describe how they worked through the problem. As they shared, several other students in the class could be overheard whispering to their partners, “We didn’t even think about the fact that you can’t have a negative side length” and “If we had checked all our answers, we would have found our mistake.” Many students wrote in their logbooks that they thought they had persevered and found all the solutions but with further checking realized that the problem required only positive values for the lengths of the sides (see the examples in fi g. 4).",80,Classroom Strategies to Make Sense and Persevere

Discuss what perseverance means, and share examples of how various individuals became successful after persevering. Select examples from curriculum materials and other resources that require students to apply their conceptual understanding and knowledge of givens and constraints to solve the problems.

Several students shared their ideas and offered suggestions to correct the mistakes. In all our classes, we encouraged students to view “understanding the approaches of others” (SMP 1) and analyzing solution methods as learning experiences. The Analyzing Incorrect Responses  strategy helped our students recognize their errors in a discreet way and hear from classmates why an answer or a strategy did not make sense. The activity helped students think critically about the appropriateness of the mathematical process used and the reasonableness of the solution found.

By implementing these strategies, we helped our students explicitly focus on both the solutions and the strategies and think about whether they made sense. By the end of the academic year, we noticed fewer unreasonable answers and fewer students giving up on problems. Instead, students were circling their answers and often saying, “But does it make sense?” or “I found an answer, but it doesn’t make sense to me.” They were also recognizing both the need to persevere and how they persevered to solve a problem.
