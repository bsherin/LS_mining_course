"James Hohman, and Karen Hickman hHow middle school students view  mathematics is a function of what they learn and how they learn it. Evidence from actual classrooms shows that a serious disconnection sometimes occurs between what students think mathematics can deliver and the real world (Burrill 1997). Students must have the opportunity to discover multiple ways to solve real-life problems through problem solving, using estimation and conjecture, and developing critical communication skills in the classroom.",2,mtms2007-10-164a,,

"Mathematics specifies that middle- level students should engage in contextual and meaningful computation to obtain computational fluency. “Students’ understanding of computation can be enhanced by developing their own methods and sharing them with one another, explaining why their methods work and are reasonable to use, and then comparing their methods with the algorithms traditionally taught in school” (NCTM 2000, p.  germaine taggart, gtaggart@fhsu.edu, is the interim chair for the Department of Teacher Education at Fort Hays State University, Hays, KS 67601.

220). The flexibility of representation that comes through the use of problem solving and estimation skills allows students to more deeply understand numbers and to develop the number sense and computational fluency that is advocated by the NCTM’s Standards.,5,mtms2007-10-164a,,
"Results from the Sixth National Assessment of Educational Progress (Kenney and Silver 1997) imply that students in eighth grade have little sense of the relative magnitude of numbers. This statement is cause for concern, since middle school students “should develop a sense of the magnitude of very large numbers . . . and become proficient at reading and representing them” (NCTM 2000, p. 217). We live in a world of numbers that are both large and small in magnitude. We view international budgets in the trillions of dollars, and describe molecules and atoms with minute values. One strategy that can address the value of working with numbers of magnitude is the use of Fermi questions. ",6,mtms2007-10-164a,,
What are FerMi Questions?,7,mtms2007-10-164a,,
"Fermi questions are attributed to Enrico Fermi, a physicist who came to America from Italy before World War II. His work led to the first nuclear fission reaction and contributed to the construction of the first atomic bomb. He received the Nobel Prize for his work with neutrons (Nobel Foundation 2007). Fermi had the unique ability to do rapid calculations and estimations based on limited information. He not only estimated quantities in the physical world, he also dealt with such questions as this: “How many piano tuners live in New York City?” This habit of mind and method of estimation became identified as Fermi questions. Fermi questions are “the estimation of rough but quantitative answers to unexpected questions about many aspects of the natural world. Fermi delighted to think up and, at once, to discuss and to answer questions which drew upon deep understanding of the world, upon everyday experience, and upon the ability to make rough approximations, inspired guesses, and statistical estimates from very little data” (Morrison 1963, pp. 626–27).",8,mtms2007-10-164a,,
"Fermi questions provide students  the chance to sharpen the skills of problem solving, estimation, numerical reasoning, communication, and questioning. A Fermi question is posed, and limited information is given. The goal is to determine an order-of-magnitude answer by making reasonable assumptions about the situation, not necessarily relying on definite knowledge for an exact answer. The order of magnitude used is typically a power of ten.",9,mtms2007-10-164a,,
"Fermi questions can be used in  the classroom by having small groups or pairs of students solve a problem, with the teacher acting as facilitator. NCTM emphasizes communication that supports a sense of community within a classroom, which enables  students to express ideas without fear of ridicule (NCTM 2000). Fermi questions, when used as a pedagogical strategy, can help build a sense of community and mathematical confidence through discussion and justification of students’ problem-solving processes, as described below. ",10,mtms2007-10-164a,,
"What are other FerMi Questions, and Where can you Find theM? Consider the following two examples. “How many drops of water are there in Lake Erie?” (University of Western Ontario 2001). This question requires an estimate of the volume of a drop of water, the volume of Lake Erie from approximate dimensions, and conversion of units. The answer would ideally be an estimate accurate within a factor of ten. The second example is this: “How many balloons will it take to fill the school gymnasium?” (Math Forum 1996). Student groups will need to ask these additional questions: “How big is each balloon?” and “What are the approximate dimensions of the school gym?” Additional Fermi questions can be found at www.",11,mtms2007-10-164a,,

"As students begin to work through  these examples, they realize that the answer to a question is at times less important than the steps taken to find the answer. Fermi questions encourage multiple approaches, emphasize process rather than product, and promote nontraditional problemsolving strategies. Students are challenged to do much more than just provide an answer to questions. After working with Fermi questions, students will begin to strengthen many of their mathematical skills. In addition, students will learn that solutions will often take multiple routes, as demonstrated in the following lesson.",14,mtms2007-10-164a,,

Assessing student knowledge,16,mtms2007-10-164a,,
"The prerequisite knowledge required to solve a Fermi question is proficiency in unit conversions, such as centimeters to meters, by using scientific notation or other methods. Teachers may elect to assess their students through such process strategies as concept mapping, Socratic dialogue (an extensive discussion of the topic), paper-and-pencil assessments, or from observing skills. ",17,mtms2007-10-164a,,
"Teachers may ask, “How much does  one cubic meter of pennies weigh?” Such a question prompts students to consider representing data, solving the question through multiple processes, and thinking flexibly about number sense because estimation can provide an appropriate response to such a question. This question also provides a means of assessing students’ initial abilities to deal with estimation and the calculations dealing with exponentials. ",18,mtms2007-10-164a,,
Lesson introduction,19,mtms2007-10-164a,,
"Ask students what makes a valid approximation. The right answer, a reasonable guess, a number that answers the questions asked, or evidence that the approximation is reasonable might be a few possible responses. Once students understand approximation, discuss the rationale for Fermi questions. Give students information about Enrico Fermi and some of the questions that he has been credited with asking. Web-based examples are useful for providing students with models for solving Fermi questions (Lentz 1993). ",20,mtms2007-10-164a,,
"Middle school students may be  uncomfortable working with problems that do not have an exact answer or do not have an algorithm leading to a definitive solution. Our experience in using Fermi questions to develop estimation and number sense with middle school students indicates that visual or hands-on materials can help students develop a mental model for solving  an abstract problem. For example, a  seventh-grade algebra class was asked to estimate the number of grains of rice eaten in China each year. Students initially had difficulty until one student brought in a bowl of cooked rice after having counted the number of uncooked grains it contained. From this concrete starting point, students could estimate the number of grains eaten in a day by estimating the number of meals, and so on, to make a realistic estimate for the number of grains of rice eaten each year. Depending on the developmental level of the class, you could discuss the economic importance of estimating the amount of rice that farmers in the United States could potentially export to China.",21,mtms2007-10-164a,,
Concept development,22,mtms2007-10-164a,,
"The class, before dealing with a complex Fermi question, should discuss the stepby-step process by working through one mathematical example found on the Web. The teacher can facilitate the discussion by pointing out the rationale used for estimation, alternate ways of starting the problem, and cultural and personal experiences in determining reasonable starting points for estimation. Depending on the developmental level of the class, a few examples may be needed to show the relevance and power of estimation in dealing with significant real-world problems drawn from the news. The example provided here is from 2005, Hurricane Katrina.",23,mtms2007-10-164a,,
"This section of the lesson begins  with a discussion of some of the problems associated with the hurricane, leading to the issue of fresh water for the survivors remaining in New Orleans after the storm. The question we posed from a review of the news was this: “How many semitrailer loads of bottled water [16.9 fluid ounces] were needed by New Orleans’ refugees in the week following Hurricane Katrina?” Before the students work on the  problem, they should brainstorm or list key questions that need to be consid-",24,mtms2007-10-164a,,
"Fermi questions give students the chance to sharpen various mathematical skills ered in finding a solution. The following list of questions were identified as being essential for solving this question. The estimations we used were based on reviewing Internet news sources, “common knowledge,” and guesses.  •  How many refugees were estimated to have remained in New Orleans in the week following Hurricane Katrina? (20,000–25,000 people, based on initial reports) •  What quantity of water is recommended for a person to drink per day? (4 to 6 bottles, with 16 ounces per bottle, is 64 to 96 ounces) •  What is the total amount of water  needed for 25,000 refugees for a week? (Using the upper estimate of 6 bottles: 25,000 refugees × 6 bottles per refugee per day × 7 days is approximately 1,000,000, or 1 × 106, bottles) •  What are the interior dimensions of a semitrailer box? (53 feet × 8 feet × 8.5 feet, or approximately 3,600 cubic feet. These values were researched using the Internet.) •  What is the carrying capacity of a  semitrailer with the dimensions listed above? (40,000 pounds. This value was researched using the Internet.) •  What are the typical dimensions  of a 24 pack of water in cubic feet? (15 inches × 10 inches × 8 inches = 1,200 cubic inches; there are 1,728 cubic inches in 1 cubic foot, which is approximately 1,800 cubic inches; 1,200/1,800 = 2/3, or  0.7 cubic foot per package) •  How many packages of bottled water would fit into one semitrailer? (3,600 cubic feet ÷ 0.7 cubic foot per package ≈ 5,000 packages) •  How many bottles of water would  fit into the semitrailer? (approximately 120,000 bottles) •  How many pounds of payload could a semitrailer carry safely? (Each bottle has approximately 16 fluid ounces of water, which has a weight of approximately 1 pound. Therefore, our estimated weight is 120,000 pounds of water, which is about three times more than the semitrailer’s capacity. Even though a semitrailer could hold 120,000 pounds, the payload capacity is limited to no more than 40,000 bottles per semitrailer.) •  How many semitrailer loads of bottled water were needed by New Orleans’ refugees in the week following Hurricane Katrina? (1,000,000 bottles ÷ 40,000 pounds per semitrailer = 25 semitrailers)",25,mtms2007-10-164a,,
"Depending on the classroom environment, students can be divided into groups and assigned roles, such as recorder, presenter, mathematician, and researcher, to find information through Internet search engines, newspapers, and reference books. Or approach this activity as a class, with teams working on a cluster of questions to obtain a value. In so doing, the class as a whole will work through the calculations.",26,mtms2007-10-164a,,
"Prompt students to work together  in small groups to find logical estimates. Each group can then prepare the chain of logic and calculations on a whiteboard or other classroom display board. Each group has one minute to present its solution. Each team, regardless of organization, would state its approximation, derived values, and reasoning for these values.",27,mtms2007-10-164a,,
evaluation,28,mtms2007-10-164a,,
"After students explain how they reached their solutions and estimates, give them feedback and ask them to work together in groups and find another Fermi question on the Internet or devise one of their own. The groups should determine a solution for their Fermi question and be prepared to share and present it to the class. The total instructional time for this activity should be limited to ensure that time is spent on task; we have generally allowed fifteen minutes for this task. Also helpful would be role designations for each individual in the group to foster equitable participation.",29,mtms2007-10-164a,,
