"The Percent  Predicament hHave you ever thought that a student  grasped the ideas you were hoping they would learn only to find out that you were mistaken? It is often perplexing for teachers to— correct understanding in new  situations.   1.  learn how students have internalized certain ideas about mathematics, both correct and incorrect; and 2.  be certain that students will apply ",2,mtms2010-03-374a,,

Through the use of models, their work with these ideas emphasized the meaning of percent. They used benchmark quantities in judging the size of fractions and could represent quantities using equivalent forms of fractions, decimals, and percents (NCTM 2000). By conducting regular reviews of the relationship of percent notation to decimal and fraction forms, the teacher’s intent was for students to consolidate these representations and deepen their understanding. ",5,mtms2010-03-374a,,
"Most students in the class could  distinguish between fractions and fractional percents and could apply the benchmarks of 0, 1/2, and 1 to assess the magnitude of quantities written in different forms. For example, when comparing 2/3 with 2/3 percent, some students reasoned that 2/3 was more than 50 percent whereas 2/3 percent was less than 1 percent. They referred to the 100-grid model, saying that 2/3 percent would not fill in one small square. Dusty often emerged as a student  who could explain a solution. Therefore, the teacher asked him to pose a question about comparing two numbers for other students to solve. Dusty asked everyone whether 5/7 was the same as 5/7 percent. ",6,mtms2010-03-374a,,
"The next class period began with Dusty’s problem. To generally assess students’ thinking, the teacher took a poll after giving students the following choices:  5/7 = 5/7% 5/7 > 5/7% 5/7 < 5/7%",7,mtms2010-03-374a,,
"To the teacher’s surprise, all the  students, including Dusty, chose  5/7 = 5/7%. What a predicament! Since no student could be called on with another point of view, as usually happened in class, the teacher could not begin to address the misunderstanding by building on students’ ideas. The only choice was to unveil more of the students’ thinking. ",8,mtms2010-03-374a,,
"Students had already learned how to represent fraction-decimal relationships on a 100 grid, so the teacher gave each student two grids and asked them to show a representation of 5/7 on one grid and 5/7 percent on the other grid. Before starting to work, students asked, “What is 100 ÷ 7?” This question was unexpected. ",9,mtms2010-03-374a,,
"The teacher expected students to  approach the problem by dividing the square into 7 parts and shading 5, which was the strategy most often used with an area model to represent fractions. Although the strategies can be equally effective, dividing the square into 7 parts and shading 5 is different from dividing 100 by 7 to find how many squares to shade. When the teacher asked why they needed to know the quotient of 100 ÷ 7, Alyssa explained that to show the correct percent on the grid, the 100 needed to be divided by 7 and that result multiplied by 5.

"The teacher was uncertain why the students took this particular approach, but he answered that 100 ÷ 7 was “14 point something.” This response, however, did not satisfy the students. They again asked, “What is 100 ÷ 7?” This time the teacher answered, “14 2/7.” Again, the information did not satisfy the students, who vigorously explained that they wanted to know the real answer and to use a calculator to find it. They did not specify what they meant by a real answer. ",13,mtms2010-03-374a,,
"While agreeing to the use of a fraction calculator, the teacher  thought about how he might use this request as a teachable moment to probe, challenge, and understand their thinking. He decided to use the fraction keys to enter the fraction 100/7, aware that the calculator would not display a fraction in any other form. He showed the students that the calculator just displayed 100/7 (see fig. 1) and asked them what to do next. After seeing the fraction, the  students informed the teacher that he must have done something incorrectly: “One hundred over seven [100/7] is one hundred sevenths, not 100 divided by 7!” indicating that these forms, 100/7 and 100 ÷ 7, were “not equivalent” representations. The teacher used a conversion key to change 100/7 to a decimal (see fig. 1b), which produced 14.28571429, and then entered  100 ÷ 7 (see fig. 1c). The outcome surprised the class and led to a short discussion about why these two actions produced the same result. With the equivalence of 100 ÷ 7 and 100/7 established and the value of 100 ÷ 7 = 14.28571429 determined, the students continued the task of showing 5/7 and 5/7 percent on two different grids. After several minutes of work, students were ready to share. ",14,mtms2010-03-374a,,
"Michael explained his method for  representing 5/7 on one of the 100 grids. He rounded 14.28571429 to 14.2, found that 14 × 5 = 70, and then added the 0.2 back in to come up with 70.2 percent. Although no one questioned his reasoning, there was general agreement that 5/7 was close to 70 percent. ",15,mtms2010-03-374a,,
"Neither Michael nor the other students deviated from their earlier assertion that 5/7 was equal to 5/7 percent. Dusty then asked for a calculator, pushed some keys, and said to Michael, “The calculator disagrees with you.” The other students asked for calculators and used the Fraction Line of the NUM/FRACT LINE application as they investigated Dusty’s claim. ",16,mtms2010-03-374a,,
"Figure 2 shows calculator screens  from four students. Each screen displays both 5/7 and 5/7 percent on a number line: 5/7 is shown on the top, and 5/7 percent is shown on the bottom. Note that the calculator represented 5/7 percent as .71428571432%. After seeing the comparison of 5/7 and 5/7 percent, most students were able to verify Dusty’s claim that the calculator disagreed with Michael. Although the screens were not identical, the students recognized that 5/7 and 5/7 percent were not even close to being equal. When someone said that it looked like 5/7 percent might even be the same as 0, it was helpful to have one screen that showed some distance between 0 and 5/7 percent. This input helped Dusty remember his thinking from the previous day as he explained that “5/7 percent is not 0, but it is less than 1 percent.” He used a grid to show just how small 5/7 percent is, demonstrated that 5/7 is “over half,” and concluded that the two numbers 5/7 and 5/7 percent are not equal. He then added, “I get it. They are not the same. I was thinking if you changed 5/7 to a percent the percent value would be the same as 5/7.” In other words, Dusty had confused the idea of 5/7 as a number with the procedure he had been shown outside of math class for changing a score given as a fraction, such as 5 out of 7, or 5/7, to a percent representation. Everyone agreed that 5/7 was not equal to 5/7 percent. The percent predicament was resolved.  teaching and leaRning iMplications",17,mtms2010-03-374a,,

What would have happened if each  student had a calculator earlier in the discussion?  2.  If the teacher had not provided an  answer, how would the students have used the calculator to determine 100 ÷ 7?  3.  If a 100 grid had not been pro- vided, what model would students have chosen to represent 5/7 and 5/7 percent? ",20,mtms2010-03-374a,,
"On another level, the percent predicament is a reminder of the complexity of the many notations related to fractions, decimals, and percents, which can result in these questions:  1.  What was at the core of the stu- dents’ thinking about this problem? 2.  Why was their approach so different  from what the teacher anticipated? 3.  Was the discrepancy rooted in the context of the question, the models provided, or previous experience? ",21,mtms2010-03-374a,,
"Although teachers’ pedagogical choices can impact students’ thinking, the flip side is also true in that students’ thinking affects pedagogy. The direction of that relationship may not always be clear at the end of a problem. ",22,mtms2010-03-374a,,
