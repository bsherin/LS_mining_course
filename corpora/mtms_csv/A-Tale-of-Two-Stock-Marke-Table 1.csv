0,A Tale of Two Stock Markets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Introducing the stock market to students during math class makes both economics and mathematics more meaningful, teaches mathematical concepts using real-world data, and fits in well with the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSM) (CCSSI 2010b). Furthermore, fluctuations in the stock market can lead to valuable student insight about change in function values over time.",,
1,A Tale of Two Stock Markets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In addition to developing financial literacy, a stock market project places mathematics within an authentic setting. Teaching mathematics through a problem-based format enhances student engagement and promotes understanding beyond the typical curriculum as it builds context for learning. Citing the Cognition and Technology Group at Vanderbilt (1990), Boaler (2002) writes that problem-oriented approaches to learning help students view mathematical concepts as useful tools that they can use in different situations rather than as algorithms only used in school (p. 123).",,
2,A Tale of Two Stock Markets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"This article describes two different projects using the stock market as a context for learning. For both projects, students bought shares in individual companies, tracked stock prices for a period of time, and then sold their shares at a gain or loss. The projects are adaptable for students in late elementary school through high school and tie in well with CCSS for both mathematics and English language arts.",,
3,A Tale of Two Stock Markets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Stock market project 1,,
4,A Tale of Two Stock Markets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Mr. Piercey, Ms. Larkin, and Ms. McCloud team-taught the first stock market project in two fifth-grade classes over a three-week period. During a brief introductory discussion, students learned that companies sell stock to raise money and that shares of a company can be bought and sold in a stock market.",,
5,A Tale of Two Stock Markets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The first phase, called the  Pepsi/Coke Challenge, involved tracking the stock of both Pepsi and Coke for two weeks. At the beginning of each day, Larkin and McCloud projected an online stock quote for both companies on the board. The students recorded these values as the daily price of a share of stock in each company. At the end of each week, they used these observations as a representative data set and created a double-line graph (similar to the student work in fig. 1) to show the value of the stock (in dollars) over time.",,
6,A Tale of Two Stock Markets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
7,A Tale of Two Stock Markets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"During class discussion, students used the graph to respond to questions comparing the market performance of Coke and Pepsi, requiring students to analyze data using a graphical representation. Unfortunately, almost all the students thought that Coke was a better investment than Pepsi because the stock price of Coke was always higher than that of Pepsi. This indicated that students focused on the values of the functions themselves, not how the functions were changing. This concept is  specifically addressed in Project 2.",,
8,A Tale of Two Stock Markets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"During the second phase of  Project 1, students selected their own stocks from a list of familiar companies. Using the schools computer lab, students learned some of the basic elements of a stock quote using Google Finance (www.google.com/finance), a website that displays both real-time and historical stock market data along with relevant news articles. Students recorded the current price of their selected stock to represent the purchase price. During the next visit, students looked up the quote again, wrote down the new price, and determined their gain or loss. Some students looked at news links and even expressed surprise when their stock price rose in spite of what they interpreted as bad press for a particular stock choice (a robbery of a Dominos employee while out on a delivery). This phase involved students gathering information from digital sources, assessing credibility, and paraphrasing the data of others, all found in the Common Core State Standards for English Language Arts and Literacy (CCSSI 2010a, p. 44).",,
9,A Tale of Two Stock Markets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Stock market project 2,,
10,A Tale of Two Stock Markets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Mrs. Hunley and Ms. Hine team-taught a similar month-long project in a single fourth-grade classroom. To introduce the project, the class simulated the stock market using slips of paper representing shares of Facebook. For purchasing power, students were randomly given pieces of paper labeled as $200, $500, or $1000.",,
11,A Tale of Two Stock Markets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Hine held up a sheet of paper that represented Facebook stock (see fig. 2). She narrated, Pretend I own Facebook. I want to expand it by buying a new server that costs $4000. How do I get the extra money? I can sell pieces of my company.",,
12,A Tale of Two Stock Markets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
13,A Tale of Two Stock Markets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"She then cut up a portion of the Facebook company/paper into 8 shares. Who will pay me $500 to own a piece of Facebook? she asked. Students acted excited to buy a share of a well-known company. Some students could not afford a share, and one student (Kendra) bought two shares. Hine sold 8 shares but explained that she still had control because she kept most of her company. The class briefly talked about what students actually bought: It was just a little piece of paper indicating part-ownership in Facebook.",,
14,A Tale of Two Stock Markets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"She described that an increase in Facebook popularity could inflate the stock price and asked if anyone wanted to buy or sell Facebook stock if the price rose to $1000. Some students clamored to trade, although not everyone wanted to sell. They did not want to give up a piece of Facebook so easily. Kendra sold both of her shares for $1000 each, and the class analyzed the outcome of the trades. Kendra now had $2000. When asked how much money she made, many students incorrectly wanted to say $2000. As in Project 1, students had difficulty distinguishing the change in value from the value itself. The class discussed the situation and ultimately decided that Kendra made $1000.",,
15,A Tale of Two Stock Markets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Hine next introduced a competitor website called Facespace, which could deflate the stock price for Facebook. If website users move to Facespace, investors may no longer want to own Facebook stock, or they may think the value of Facebook stock will rise again. This time, Hine asked if anyone wanted to trade Facebook shares at $200. After an eruption of excited trades, the class evaluated what happened. Matthews investment decreased from $1000 to $200, so he lost $800. The class quickly determined the correct amount that Matthew lost, demonstrating a better understanding than before of changes in function values.",,
16,A Tale of Two Stock Markets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"After this activity, students wrote for three minutes in their mathematics journals about what they learned. Multiple students wrote that they learned that a stock is a piece of a company. Students also shared that stock markets can cause disappointment because people could lose money. Statements such as stock markets can increase and decrease demonstrated a conceptual understanding of change over time, although it would have been better for students to have written that stock values, notstock markets, can change. Journal entries such as that in figure 3 demonstrated understanding of an intermediate step between a company selling stocks and making more money; the company uses the capital to improve its products.",,
17,A Tale of Two Stock Markets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
18,A Tale of Two Stock Markets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Hine started a chart on the board with the values of Facebook shares for the previous week (see table 1). The class talked about how much money they would have gained or lost if they bought 100 shares of stock on April 4 and sold it on April 9. It would be more challenging and more realistic to ask students to invest $1000 in the stock market. Then students would have to calculate the number of shares purchased and the current value of the stock, requiring multistep calculations with decimals. The class also filled in the current share price from Google Finance. While students clustered around the computer, the value of Facebook stock changed from $28.02 to $28.01. This real-time change excited the students and presented another opportunity to distinguish between values and changes in values over time.",,
19,A Tale of Two Stock Markets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
20,A Tale of Two Stock Markets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Next, students chose their own groups and selected a company from a student-friendly list of stocks: Facebook, Coca-Cola, Hersheys, McDonalds, Apple, and Disney. Group members looked up the value of their stock daily and recorded both the share price and the value of  100 shares.",,
21,A Tale of Two Stock Markets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"After two weeks, the students had enough data for a graphing lesson. Hine copied one students chart on the board and asked students how to create a graphical representation of the data. The session took place organically as students shared what they remembered about graph titles, units, and labeling axes. Following student suggestions, Hine plotted the data on a coordinate plane drawn on the board. The class connected the points with line segments, creating a graph similar to that in figure 4. The class then talked about the changes in the values of the stock price over time.",,
22,A Tale of Two Stock Markets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
23,A Tale of Two Stock Markets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Hine stood on the left side of the graph, at April 11, and asked, If we pretend that this graph is a slide, will I slide up or down? She walked along the x-axis, moving forward in time. After repeating this a few times, nearly all the students said that Hine would slide down and then slide up. Throughout this discussion, the students demonstrated an intuitive grasp of increasing and decreasing functions. To finish the session, each student plotted his or her own teams data.",,
24,A Tale of Two Stock Markets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"After another two weeks of data collection, Hine reviewed basic stock market concepts with the whole class. The class knew that companies sell stocks to make money that can be used to buy other things. Students offered that McDonalds might buy more tables for seating or Facebook might buy a bigger server. These suggested infrastructure purchases demonstrated greater knowledge than on the first day when students said companies sold stock to make money. The students finished their graphs and analyzed the data. Each group calculated its total gain or loss and offered a possible reason for the change. The class discussed the results for all six teams, including why students thought certain stocks gained value whereas other stocks lost value.",,
25,A Tale of Two Stock Markets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Hunley and Hine asked the students to write what they learned from the project and why they thought their stock produced a gain or suffered a loss. This question required students to write an argument to support their statement. Several students wrote that they learned people can buy and sell stocks and that values do not stay the same.,,
26,A Tale of Two Stock Markets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The journal entries showed that students understood gain and loss; some students explained how to calculate changes in value or created an example demonstrating the calculation. The students also displayed a good grasp of potential reasons for stock price changes. For example, one student thought that Facebook stock lost value because people currently use other websites instead of Facebook (see fig. 5).",,
27,A Tale of Two Stock Markets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
28,A Tale of Two Stock Markets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Another student, DeVaughn, wrote this journal entry about his Apple stock:",,
29,A Tale of Two Stock Markets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,1. I learned that stocks can go up and down in a different amount of time.,,
30,A Tale of Two Stock Markets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,2. I liked putting down information.,,
31,A Tale of Two Stock Markets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,I made money because they are coming out with the new iphone 6 and ipod 5.,,
32,A Tale of Two Stock Markets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Hine also interviewed students to determine what they gained from the project. Jason learned that stock markets dont stay the same and you can either lose a whole bunch of money or you can gain a lot of money. The students also learned why companies sell stocks. Paige explained, Companies sell stocks because they want to earn money, make money so they can buy new stuff, supplies they need. Cindy elaborated that companies sell stock so they can make more money and they can get more things for [their company] so they can make a lot more money.",,
33,A Tale of Two Stock Markets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"When asked why people buy stocks, each student responded that people buy stocks to sell them for more money, indicating that students grasped the idea of change in function value. Jeffrey shared, People sell stocks to get money to buy new stocks so they can sell that and make money. They can also buy stock and sell it for more, and I know that it is called a profit. And then if you lose money, then its called loss.",,
34,A Tale of Two Stock Markets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"All the students who were interviewed knew that people do not always make money, although Paige thought that because Apple is a good company, investors would make money. Cindy said that people cannot predict if their stock will go up or down. Jason summarized, Its all about people going to your website, or like buying . . . stuff that youre selling. The students knew that the value of a company depends on how consumers interact with the company.",,
35,A Tale of Two Stock Markets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Extensions,,
36,A Tale of Two Stock Markets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The project could be extended to higher grades by introducing the difference between continuous and discrete data. The class could compare a graph of a single days data with a graph of a few months of data from a single stock. The varying level of detail visible on each graph would help students realize the difference between real-time data and tracking one data point per day. This extension demonstrates how discrete data can represent continuous data, emphasizing that the students capture only a daily snapshot of their companys performance. This is an important concept, especially because the stock market metric often reported is the closing price, which is just a representation of overall activity.",,
37,A Tale of Two Stock Markets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The project could also be extended by allowing students to create a stock market portfolio with an initial fixed dollar amount. This activity more realistically represents choices that employees have to make when selecting pension and retirement plans. It also illustrates diversification. Free websites, such as www.marketwatch.com/game/, allow teachers to manage a more complicated stock market game.",,
38,A Tale of Two Stock Markets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Reflections,,
39,A Tale of Two Stock Markets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"One particular challenge faced by students was distinguishing between the value of a stock at a point in time and the change in the value over a period of time. As students collected the data, Larkin and McCloud asked which stock would have been a better investment. The students overwhelmingly selected the stock whose value was highest, even if that stock value had decreased and the other had increased. This was addressed fairly successfully in Project 2 by focusing on gain and loss. In future projects, this could be addressed by generating tables, such those shown in table 2, that show stock values and their changes. Students could be directed to use the changes to justify their decision of a better investment.",,
40,A Tale of Two Stock Markets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
41,A Tale of Two Stock Markets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In addition, it is important for students to understand the risk involved when investing in the stock market. Students should not think of stocks as a source of easy money. Both projects addressed this issue, with Project 2  improving significantly on Project 1  by repeatedly addressing the risk of loss. Students should also learn that higher risk entails both the possibility of greater reward as well as more likelihood of loss.",,
42,A Tale of Two Stock Markets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Future versions of this activity could also employ preproject interviews or journaling to assess what students know prior to the project. This would provide additional qualitative evidence of growth in financial literacy to supplement students self-assessment of what they learned. (See the sidebar for suggested questions.),,
43,A Tale of Two Stock Markets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Stock market project promotes student engagement,,
44,A Tale of Two Stock Markets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Teaching mathematics with projects has the potential to enhance student engagement. Both teaching teams observed that nearly all the students remained on task throughout each session dedicated to this project. Students were enthusiastic about the project and eager to check the stock prices, even outside of mathematics class. These budding financial analysts were interested in looking up not only their own but also the stock prices of their classmates.",,
45,A Tale of Two Stock Markets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"During both projects, students who had previously performed poorly in mathematics were inspired to participate more actively during class. In one class, a student who was not usually academically successful raised a hand for the first time all year to respond to a question. After the project, engagement continued to improve, and the student joined the classroom community, ultimately achieving a meets score on the state standardized test. Although the stock market project cannot be given credit for this achievement, it did start this student down the road to success.",,
46,A Tale of Two Stock Markets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Anchoring mathematics in real-life provided natural opportunities for learning. It made sense to the students to make graphs because the class needed a way to represent the data. Instead of expecting students to learn concepts so that they could use skills later, teaching mathematics in context demonstrated the need of skills now. This created a time for telling because the students were prepared to absorb the significance of the lesson (Schwartz and Bransford 1998).  Furthermore, the teaching teams believed that the use of familiar companies helped the students engage with the project and reason through profit and loss. Through their own knowledge of the companies, students could make sense of the business purpose for raising capital as well as how product announcements and public opinion could affect stock prices, allowing students to become the experts and draw their own conclusions.",,
47,A Tale of Two Stock Markets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"During these projects, students learned important mathematical lessons that align with state standards, such as constructing graphs and determining where functions are increasing or decreasing. The projects incorporated deeper levels of mathematical literacy as students constructed meaning to the mathematics. For example, students connected numerical data to a real event when they acted surprised to see an increase in the value of Dominos stock despite a negative news story. Many students who participated in Project 2 demonstrated that they learned the difference between a stocks value and the change in a stocks value. Hunley and Hine addressed function change over time through class discussions about stock value and thinking of the graph as a slide.",,
48,A Tale of Two Stock Markets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Beyond the mathematical lessons, this project introduced students to stock market investment. Students learned that people buy and sell shares of companies and that investment entails risk. By introducing sophisticated financial concepts at a young age, teachers give students time to wrestle with critical life skills. Although these students still have much more to learn about investing, they have gained important foundational knowledge about the stock market.",,
49,A Tale of Two Stock Markets - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Best of all, the projects provided students with a reason to engage with mathematics.",,
