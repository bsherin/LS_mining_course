33,Are You Ticketed to Win or Lose_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
34,Are You Ticketed to Win or Lose_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"b. Sample answer: No. The issue should not be whether or not Brutus buys a losing ticket. Rather, he should realize that purchasing 2 tickets would double his chances of winning.",,
35,Are You Ticketed to Win or Lose_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Sample answer: Yes. Buying raffle tickets is usually a losing a proposition. The fewer you buy, the less money you lose.",,

39,Are You Ticketed to Win or Lose_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Sample answer: This is not a good investment because for each ticket he buys, he would be investing $25 to win, on average $20.",,
40,Are You Ticketed to Win or Lose_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"4. a. Yes. The 400 single tickets sold will produce 400  $25, or $10,000. The 200 people taking advantage of the special offer will generate 200  $75, or $15,000. With this pricing model, the park district will generate $25,000, leaving a $5,000 profit.",,
41,Are You Ticketed to Win or Lose_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"b. 1/1,200. The total number of tickets in the raffle is 400 + 800, or 1,200. (The 200 people who buy 3 and get 1 free will each have 4 tickets.)",,
42,Are You Ticketed to Win or Lose_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,FIELD-TEST COMMENTS,,
43,Are You Ticketed to Win or Lose_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I completed this lesson with sixth-grade math students working in small groups after three lessons on probability near the end of the school year. My students liked the cartoon and got into some interesting discussions about Brutuss logic. The results of the discussions carried over into their answers for question 2. They either completely agreed that one ticket had a 100 percent chance of being a losing ticket or they still thought that because he had 2 tickets there was a 50 percent chance of winning. To help the students understand why 1 ticket was guaranteed to be a losing ticket, I gave them red and yellow discs. I asked them what if red were the winning color, what was the likelihood that yellow would win? They understood the situation once the discs were in hand. We then discussed the tickets.",,
44,Are You Ticketed to Win or Lose_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"My students did not understand in questions 3 and 4 that they needed to include the $20,000 prize with the $5,000 profit when calculating the number of tickets to be sold. After I checked the work from my first two classes, I realized that they had not included the $20,000, so I talked about that in my other two classes. The students who did not include the $20,000 completed their calculations correctly for the $5,000. Therefore, I knew they understood the probability concepts and selling the ticketsthey had just calculated for the wrong amount of money. The following day, I had the first two classes revisit their work, and they were all able to quickly make the corrections. They suggested that it might be helpful to be more specific about the amount of money the raffle needed to make.",,
45,Are You Ticketed to Win or Lose_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,My students enjoyed this cartoon and the discussions it produced. They thought it was really cool that this cartoon went right along with the probability that we had just studied.,,

49,Are You Ticketed to Win or Lose_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Ed. note: As a result of this feedback, we adjusted problem 3 to clarify that the $5,000 profit must occur after the $20,000 prize money is paid out.",,
50,Are You Ticketed to Win or Lose_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The consensus of my sixth-grade prealgebra class was that Brutus should focus on winning rather than on losing! In the first question, he is determined not to lose and be one of the 99 losers rather than doubling his chances of winning by purchasing two tickets. Of course, because we live in Las Vegas, my students are well aware of the probability of winning it all!",,
51,Are You Ticketed to Win or Lose_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Calculating the number of tickets that the park district must sell to make a profit was a mental math calculation. Students realized that if the $20,000 grand prize was awarded, then the raffle had to take in at least $25,000. Since each ticket was sold for $25, it was a quick calculation to figure out that 1,000 tickets must be sold. Adding the buy 3 get 1 free component to the last question provided a new challenge. With Brutuss probability of winning now at 1/1,200, they sent him the message, May the odds be in your favor!",,

My students understanding of math is at a variety of levels, so I allowed them to work with a partner on this activity. Since we were at the beginning of our unit, I found that allowing partner work was helpful in generating student discussions.",,
56,Are You Ticketed to Win or Lose_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Most students were able to determine the answers easily for the first question, but they did not indicate that Brutuss chances would double if he bought 2 tickets rather than 1 ticket (although they stated that his chances would be 2/100). Furthermore, no one understood the expected value question, so I had to provide some instruction.",,
57,Are You Ticketed to Win or Lose_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"A quick, informal survey showed that two-thirds of the students enjoyed the task. Overall, I believe this activity was challenging enough for the students without being overwhelming.",,

61,Are You Ticketed to Win or Lose_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I assigned this cartoon to my seventh-grade prealgebra class. I asked them to work on it independently at the completion of a unit on probability. My students were able to easily do all parts of questions 1. I liked that the question reinforced that the sum of the probabilities of an event occurring or not occurring is equal to 1. I also liked question 2s increase of Brutuss ticket purchase to 2. This scenario made the students think about how probability can change. With this question, some students did not think about the fact that if 1 ticket is drawn, and you have 2 tickets, at least 1 has to be a losing ticket.",,
62,Are You Ticketed to Win or Lose_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In question 3, many students did not take into consideration that to make a profit they would have to raise enough money to cover the prize of $20,000. This resulted in incorrect answers to part b as well. Without my assistance, most were unable to do part c, even though the equation that they needed was in the question. I think the best way to handle this question is to let them stumble through as best they can and then to point out their errors.",,
63,Are You Ticketed to Win or Lose_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I do not like yes or no questions, such as question 4, because most of my students are not adept at explaining their reasoning. Therefore, I would change the question to the following:",,

We had covered a complete probability unit a few months before the cartoon was assigned; therefore, I had to refresh some of the students memories with probability basics using dice and a spinner. I introduced the cartoon as a class project, and we discussed the absent-minded quality exhibited by Brutus.",,
69,Are You Ticketed to Win or Lose_ - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The boys were very surprised that Brutus did not know that buying an extra ticket would increase his chances. I asked the boys to work in groups to complete the questions. On questions 1 and 2, the students needed little direction from me. However, they struggled with the multiple steps required in questions 3 and 4. This activity worked well as a review and gave even low-achieving students confidence in basic probability.",,
