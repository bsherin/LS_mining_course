0,By way of introduction_ Probability and Statistics - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Were we to poll classroom teachers on which strand of mathematics is most neglected, there is a good chance that they would nominate probability and statistics.",,
1,By way of introduction_ Probability and Statistics - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In some classrooms, working through a probability and statistics unit is a fun, highly engaging way to kick off the school year. Students collect and analyze data about themselves and their classmates, participate in hands-on activities, and generate beautiful graphs and charts. Then October arrives, and it is time to learn about rational numbers, solve equations, and calculate area.",,
2,By way of introduction_ Probability and Statistics - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In other classrooms, a unit on probability and statistics might be saved for the end of the year, when playing and analyzing games of chance and using manipulatives keep students engaged after state exams have been administered and as summer approaches. Year after year, students and teachers focus on content that needs to be mastered so that students can march through the usual course sequence of algebra, geometry, trigonometry, andâ€”if all goes according to planâ€”calculus.",,
3,By way of introduction_ Probability and Statistics - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The irony is that probability and statistics are not only fun and engaging topics but also relevant to the daily lives of students and adults. Sports-obsessed middle school students devour books like Michael Lewisâ€™s Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game and possibly devote more energy to fantasy sports team trades than they do to their math homework. Schools continuously collect and analyze data about their students and make decisions about grades and course placement. Our online searches are analyzed by software to determine what we are likely to purchase. Election results are often called before all ballots are counted on the basis of samples taken  at polling stations. The list goes on and on, and the opportunities for learning are endless.",,
4,By way of introduction_ Probability and Statistics - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"These topics might be challenging and sometimes confusing, but they are naturally interesting because any topic can be viewed through the lens of probability and statistics, as shown by the feature articles in this issue. For example, Ann Wheeler and Joe Champion describe a novel use of geoboards to connect the study of area with both discrete and continuous probability values. Jennifer N. Lovett and Hollylynne S. Lee work backward; their students research the numeric data and figure out possible contexts. Matt B. Roscoe uses information about best-selling cars to explore relationships in bivariate  data. Carmen Petrick Smith and Kris Kenlan leverage their studentsâ€™ interests to analyze whether or not math games actually help them learn other math content. Susan A. Peters, Victoria Miller Bennett, Mandy Young, and Jonathan D. Watkins have their students thoroughly explore multiple ways of representing and calculating the mean of data that can be gathered about any topic. These articles include a mix of both hands-on materials and software-based alternatives.",,
5,By way of introduction_ Probability and Statistics - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"We hope that you enjoy the articles and that they inspire you to try something new in your classroom beyond whirling spinners, tossing dice, and pulling colored cubes from a bag.",,
