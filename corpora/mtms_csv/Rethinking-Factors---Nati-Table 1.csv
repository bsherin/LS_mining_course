0,Rethinking Factors - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"How do you think your students would define the term factor? Many learn that a factor of a number is an integer that can be multiplied by  another integer to get the number (e.g., 4 is a factor of 20 because  4  5 = 20). Another view is that  a factor of a number is an integer  that divides evenly into the number  (e.g., 4 is a factor of 20 since  20  4 = 5 with no remainder). Unfortunately, these definitions limit students understanding of factors and ability to solve more challenging problems, such as this example:  Is 25 32 7  11 divisible by 63?",,
1,Rethinking Factors - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"This article describes an exciting exploration-based activity in which students develop an alternative definition of factor that can help them solve problems like the one presented above. Students work in groups to collect data, analyze the data to make conjectures, and then spend a significant amount of time debating and justifying their conjectures. Although designed for prospective teachers (Teppo 2002), the activity can be modified for middle school classrooms. Details are given about how to implement the activity in a middle school classroom as well as what we learned from past enactments with prospective elementary teachers. It concludes with a discussion of the activitys potential to impact students related work with greatest common factors (GCF) and least common multiples (LCM).",,
2,Rethinking Factors - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Why Are Factors Important?,,
3,Rethinking Factors - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Factors are part of a larger field of study called number theory, which includes topics such as prime numbers, composite numbers, divisibility, prime factorization, greatest common factors, and least common multiples. According to the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSM), students should be learning number theory topics from kindergarten through high school (CCSSI 2010). In fourth grade, for example, students find factor pairs of whole numbers less than 100 and recognize that a whole number is a multiple of each of its factors. In sixth grade, they compute the GCF and LCM of two whole numbers. In high school, they factor quadratic and other polynomial expressions.",,
4,Rethinking Factors - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Factors and factoring concepts support a wide range of mathematical topics across grade levels. They help students identify the relationship between a factor and its multiples and make sense of important properties such as the distributive, associative, and commutative properties. Factors also support students ability to find least common denominators when adding and subtracting fractions. They also play a special role in helping students understand why a fractions decimal representation terminates or repeats. In the secondary grades, students can use factors to simplify algebraic expressions. For example, factoring polynomial and rational expressions allows students to identify relationships between their factors and zeros; they can then use this information to identify intercepts, extreme values, end behaviors, and asymptotes when graphing them on a coordinate plane (CCSSI 2010).",,
5,Rethinking Factors - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Another important concept closely tied to factors and factoring is prime factorization. Typically, students learn to find the prime factorization of a number in the middle grades. This important concept is expressed by the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, which states that each positive integer greater than 1 can be factored into a unique product of prime factors  (i.e., its prime factorization). For  example, the number 72 can be decomposed into several different factorizations (e.g., 2  3  12;  8  9), but assuming that order does not matter, it can be written in only one way using only prime factors(i.e., 23 32).",,
6,Rethinking Factors - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Although there is little research on middle school students understanding of number theory topics, research with prospective elementary teachers suggests that working with prime factorization can support a deeper understanding of divisibility, a greater ability to solve and make sense of GCF and LCM problems, and a more meaningful conceptual understanding of algebra concepts (Brown, Thomas, and Tolias 2002; Zazkis and Campbell 1996). The little research that does exist on middle school students understanding of number theory topics supports these findings (Zazkis and Gadowsky 2001).",,
7,Rethinking Factors - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Despite its importance, students struggle to use prime factorization even when they know how to find it. For example, when they are asked if m = 33 52  7 is divisible by 7, many students compute the value of m first and then divide it by 7 using long division; they do not recognize that 7 must be a factor of m because it is part of ms prime factorization (Zazkis and Gadowsky 2001). Two explanations for these difficulties are that students (1) usually think of a factor as one of two integers multiplied together and (2) are not accustomed to working with prime-factored representations of natural numbers. By giving students more opportunities to explore numbers in prime-factored form, they can improve their ability to work with prime factorization (Zazkis and Gadowsky 2001).",,
8,Rethinking Factors - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Describing the Activity,,
9,Rethinking Factors - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The primary goal of this activity is to help students change the way they think about factors by helping them understand that a factor of a number can be viewed as the product of any combination of the numbers prime factors. Depending on students prior knowledge of factors and prime factors, this activity can last several (25) class periods. It is suggested that lessons leading up to this activity teach students how to find factor pairs of a number, define prime and composite numbers, and construct factor trees to find the prime factorizations of positive integers. The activity has two main parts: making conjectures and justifying conjectures.",,
10,Rethinking Factors - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Part 1: Making Conjectures,,
11,Rethinking Factors - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"To begin the activity, the teacher asks students to work in small groups of three or four to find several examples of numbers that have exactly 2, 3, 4, or 5 distinct factors. When circulating from group to group, the teacher should look to see which methods students use to find the factors of a number. Some might use trial division, whereas others may generate lists of factor pairs. As each group identifies different positive integers with the required number of factors, they record these numbers in the factors table (see table 1). Some students struggle to identify numbers with exactly five distinct factors because such numbers are quite large. If they cannot find any examples, the teacher should encourage them to move on because they will have opportunities to fill in the table later.",,
12,Rethinking Factors - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
13,Rethinking Factors - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The first part of the activity can be beneficial for students because it allows them to review previously learned methods for finding factors while generating some data about numbers and their factors. As the activity continues, students will refer to their table to help them construct, verify, and refute any conjectures. Teachers can also quickly assess how well students are able to find a numbers factors and pause to review more productive strategies if students are struggling or using inefficient methods. If the class has already done a significant amount of work with factors and prime factorization, this part may be assigned as prehomework to the main activity.",,
14,Rethinking Factors - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Once groups find a few examples of each category, they begin to make conjectures about the types of numbers that have 2, 3, 4, or 5 distinct factors. For example, students often notice that numbers with exactly 2 distinct factors are prime numbers or that numbers with exactly 3 distinct factors are square numbers. (Note: This latter conjecture is incomplete.) Other claims are more difficult to make, such as the types of numbers that have  4 or 5 distinct factors. At this point, the teachers role is to press students to support their claims using the data. As students provide empirical arguments, they can begin to make sense of their data. For example, if a student makes an incorrect claim (e.g., all square numbers have 3 distinct factors), others can check their data and provide counterexamples (e.g., 16 is a square number, but it has 5 distinct factors). As the teacher asks, Do the data you collected support your claim? or Can you find a number that goes against your claim? students will think more carefully about their data.",,
15,Rethinking Factors - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Once groups have had a few minutes to discuss their ideas, the teacher should facilitate a whole-class discussion in which each group presents its conjectures, resisting the temptation to reveal which conjectures are correct or incorrect. Instead, students should have the opportunity to comment on one anothers ideas. Through debate, students can reflect on and revise  their own conjectures (e.g., squares of prime numbers have exactly  3 distinct factors) and fill in any missing parts of their factor table. The entire class may or may not agree on a set of conjectures (see table 2); regardless, the teacher should instruct students to move on to the next part of the activity without revealing the correct conjectures.",,
16,Rethinking Factors - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
17,Rethinking Factors - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Part 2: Justifying Conjectures,,
18,Rethinking Factors - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In the second part of the activity, students justify their conjectures from part 1. While working in their groups, they first find the prime factorizations of the numbers in their factor table(see table 1)typically by constructing factor treesand record this information in a new table called the prime factorization table (see table 3). If necessary, the teacher can review the factor tree method beforehand to help students find the prime factorizations.",,
19,Rethinking Factors - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The teacher should instruct students to work with their groups to use the prime factorizations to confirm or refute their previous conjectures. The purpose of this part of the activity is to help students develop more robust and generalizable arguments that focus on the relationship between prime factorization and factors. When circulating from group to group, the teacher should listen for the types of arguments students make. Comments such as I know every number with 3 factors must be a perfect square because 9 is 32 and it has 3 factors, 1, 3, and 9 are quite common as students struggle to generalize their thinking beyond individual examples. Asking questions can help students make more general arguments about the relationship between the prime factorization of a number and its factors. Such questions might include the following:",,
20,Rethinking Factors - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,1. What do all the prime factorizations of numbers with three factors have in common?,,
21,Rethinking Factors - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,2. Construct a new prime factorization of a number with 4 factors; what might it look like?,,
22,Rethinking Factors - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"For students who continue to struggle, the teacher should ask them to find the factors of a particular number using its prime factorization. The following represents a typical way that students have responded in the past:",,
23,Rethinking Factors - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The prime factorization of 21 has 3 and 7, so both 3 and 7 are factors. Since a number is always a factor of itself, 21 is a factor. And, since 1 is always a factor of any number, 1 must be a factor of 21 as well. Thats 4 factors!",,
24,Rethinking Factors - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Having students repeat this process for several numbers across one number type has helped many students begin to make a connection between prime factorization and factors. Such discussions meet the third Standard for Mathematical Practice: Construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others (CCSSI 2010, p. 6).",,
25,Rethinking Factors - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Exploring factor trees may also be a useful strategy to help students make this connection, but they should only be used for numbers with simple prime factorizations, such as 21 = 3  7, in which all the factors of 21 are visible in its factor tree (see fig. 1a). For more complex prime factorizations (e.g., 24 = 23 3), a factor tree should not be used because it can obscure some of the composite factors (see fig. 1b).",,
26,Rethinking Factors - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Once groups have begun to recognize the usefulness of prime factorization in identifying factors, the teacher should bring everyone back to a whole-class discussion to present their justifications. Typically, students use specific examples from their data, such as the explanation for 21 and its factors. The teacher can then ask the class to identify similarities across these specific examples. In past enactments, students used these examples to generalize their thinking to types of prime factorizations. For example, they would say that numbers whose prime factorizations can be represented as the product of two different prime numbers have 4 factors: the two primes, 1, and the number itself. This type of explanation promotes the idea that the factors of a number can all be found from the numbers prime factorization. The generalizable nature of this argument is challenging for students to understand, so teachers should expect this discussion to last a significant amount of time (up to  30 or 40 minutes).",,
27,Rethinking Factors - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Once students are able to make more general arguments, the teacher should provide a variety of more complex examples for students to recognize that a factor of a number is a product of any combination of the numbers prime factors. Ask the following questions:",,
28,Rethinking Factors - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,1. Find all the factors of 24 using only its prime factorization.,,
29,Rethinking Factors - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"2. Given n = 25 32 7  11, decide if each of the following numbers is a factor of n: 2, 5, 6, 15, and 63.",,
30,Rethinking Factors - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Such questions force students to construct factors by multiplying various prime factors together. In past enactments, students would write the prime factorization of 24 as 23 3 and list different combinations of prime factors to find them all (see table 4). They would also recognize that if a number can be found in the prime factorization of n, then it must be a factor (e.g., 63 must be a factor of n because 32 7 is in its prime factorization). Justifying this claim has also led to interesting conversations about the associative and commutative properties. Providing additional composite numbers, such as 12 or 30, and asking students to find all their factors using only their prime factorizations was essential in helping them recognize how factors and prime factors are related. The end result was that students were able to identify all of a numbers factors without even needing to know the numbers value or doing any long division.",,
31,Rethinking Factors - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,THE Impact on GCF and LCM,,
32,Rethinking Factors - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"This activity can not only help students develop a deeper understanding of factors and their relationship to prime factorization but also support their understanding of other number theory topics. To illustrate this potential, consider the following problem:",,
33,Rethinking Factors - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Find the GCF and LCM  of 150 and 84.,,
34,Rethinking Factors - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"A typical solution strategy to find the GCF is to repeatedly divide each number by consecutive positive integers starting with 2 until the greatest counting number that divides evenly into both is found. To find the LCM, students usually make a list of consecutive multiples of each number and stop once they find a multiple that appears on both lists. Both methods are extremely tedious, prone to errors, and require little understanding of the meaning of greatest common factor or least common multiple.",,
35,Rethinking Factors - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"By thinking of a factor as a product of any combination of prime factors, students can recognize that for any two integers",,
36,Rethinking Factors - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"a. the GCF is the product of all their shared prime factors, and",,
37,Rethinking Factors - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,b. the LCM is the product of all their prime factors excluding repeated prime factors.,,
38,Rethinking Factors - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,The two statements represent a reconceptualization of GCF and LCM based on the new definition of factor. Figure 2 shows two strategies that students can use to find GCFs and LCMs using this reconceptualization.,,

40,Rethinking Factors - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
41,Rethinking Factors - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,A Surprising Discovery about Factors,,
42,Rethinking Factors - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"This rich activity allows students to explore complex mathematics and make a surprising yet useful discovery about factors. By viewing a numbers factor as the product of any combination of the numbers prime factors, students can work with number theory topics much more flexibly and efficiently. The activity described in this article can be modified for use with a wide variety of middle school students. For example, teachers can focus on numbers with relatively few factors and simpler prime factorizations for students with a limited understanding of prime factorization.",,
43,Rethinking Factors - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"For students with more substantive prior knowledge, the teacher might consider including numbers with more factors or asking them to generalize using algebraic symbols (e.g., represent all numbers with 4 factors as the product of two primes, p  q). Regardless of the modifications made, this activity can engage middle school students in important mathematical practicesexploring, explaining, justifying, and generalizingaround a central mathematical concept.",,
