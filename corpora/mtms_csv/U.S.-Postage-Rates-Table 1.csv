4,U.S. Postage Rates,The cost of first-class postage in the United States has been on the rise for nearly a century. The table at right contains data from the U.S. Postal Service on the cost of postage from 1928 to 2014. Use the table to answer the questions below.  1.  Determine the rate of change  in the cost of first-class postage between the two given years:   a. 1928 to 1932  b. 1958 to 1963   c. 1928 to 1974   d. 1958 to 1981  e. 1988 to 1991 f. 1928 to 2014 2.  Is the rate of change constant? ,4,U.S. Postage Rates
