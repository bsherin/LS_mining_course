1,Using Tools to Make Sense of Right Triangles,"Terri L. Kurz and Mi Yeon Lee sSometimes, teaching mathematics  with a focus on conceptual understanding can be challenging. With the advent of standards and principles (CCSSI 2010; NCTM 2014) an emphasis has been placed on using tools for deeper mathematical understanding and learning with understanding. Specifically, there has been a movement to include opportunities for learners to engage in sense-making activities when exploring mathematical concepts (Schoenfeld 1992). Tools can be used to support sense making and the development of mathematical ideas, and numerous tools can support learning in geometry (e.g., geoboards, pattern blocks, three-dimensional shapes, and linking cubes). We focus on AngLegs®, which are linking rods that are becoming more common in the classroom.",1,Using Tools to Make Sense of Right Triangles

3,Using Tools to Make Sense of Right Triangles,"AngLegs are straight plastic tools that can be used to create polygons by easily connecting and disconnecting plastic pieces to test and retest conjectures. These tools are more effective than pencil-and-paper explorations in that they are durable, hands-on tools; they provide visual support so learners can easily measure angles or compare features without tedious constructions or calculations. There are six colors (lengths) that can be used to build polygons, along with a protractor. Pieces are of different colors, each color representing a different length; a decimal or whole-number value is printed on each: 7.07 cm, or 5 2 cm), 8.66 cm, or 5 3 cm), orange (5 cm), purple ( green ( yellow (10 cm), blue ( 12.24 cm, or 5 6 cm), and 14.14 cm, or 10 2 cm).",3,Using Tools to Make Sense of Right Triangles

Among other ideas, AngLegs can be used to help learners develop right triangle concepts. The activities discussed here introduce the use of AngLegs to explore the Pythagorean theorem, irrational numbers as lengths of right triangles, and two special right triangles (45-45-90° and 30-60-90°). Although the activities were used  with future teachers, they can also be implemented with middle school students because the activities align with middle school course content.

The emphasis was on making sense of right triangle features, moving beyond just memorizing and applying formulas. PSTs worked in pairs with one set of AngLegs per pair. The explorations took place over two days for approximately one and a half hours per day. ",13,Using Tools to Make Sense of Right Triangles
14,Using Tools to Make Sense of Right Triangles,"To support the visualization of  the Pythagorean theorem, the PSTs were first asked to build, describe, and classify four different right triangles. Verification of right angles could be made using the protractor attachment. After building the four right triangles, they extended each leg and the hypotenuse of the triangle into squares. Figure 1 displays the image of what learners might produce when asked to create squares from each leg of the triangle. Note how the PST explained that the sum of the areas of the smaller squares is equal to the area of the largest square in figure 2. PSTs were also encouraged to test this observation with other findings that were listed in their table.",14,Using Tools to Make Sense of Right Triangles
15,Using Tools to Make Sense of Right Triangles,"Then, the Pythagorean theorem (a2 + b2 = c2) was connected to their discovery. After seeing the connection, one PST stated, “The Pythagorean theorem is literally squared. It means that the sides of the triangles are literally turned into squares.” The PSTs then tested a nonexample against their conjecture by building a nonright triangle and testing whether the extended squares worked. After building an equilateral triangle, one PST said, “No, because the areas of the squares would [all] be equal.”",15,Using Tools to Make Sense of Right Triangles
