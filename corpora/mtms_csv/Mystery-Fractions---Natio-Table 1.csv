0,Mystery Fractions - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Making math more engaging for students is a challenge that every teacher faces on a daily basis. We are constantly searching for rich problem-solving tasks that cover the necessary content, develop critical-thinking skills, and engage our studentsâ€™ interest. The Mystery Fraction activity focuses on a key number theory concept of divisibility and connects it to many important concepts in middle school mathematics, including place value, fraction sense, scale factors, reasoning and proof, and counting.",,
1,Mystery Fractions - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The puzzle-like flavor of this problem-solving activity is an important element in helping capture studentsâ€™ interest (King 2014). Our activity is designed to foster studentsâ€™ skills related to critical thinking, reasoning, and problem solving. It also aligns with the Mathematics Teaching Practices found in NCTMâ€™s Principles to Actions: Ensuring Mathematical Success for All (2014), which encourage teachers to â€œimplement tasks that promote reasoning and problem solvingâ€ (p. 10). In addition, the activity addresses several of the Common Coreâ€™s Standards for Mathematical Practice (CCSSI 2010), including making sense of problems, persevering in developing a solution, constructing viable arguments, and critiquing the work of others. This activity is therefore ideal for students in grades 6, 7, and/or 8; the problem is challenging enough for eighth-grade students, yet accessible at the sixth-grade level.",,
2,Mystery Fractions - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,CENTRAL OBJECTIVES,,
3,Mystery Fractions - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,The main focus of this activity is to explore possible strategies to determine a mystery fraction that must satisfy certain conditions and is equivalent to a given number. The first problem is this:,,
4,Mystery Fractions - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Find a three-digit integer ABC, where A, B, and C represent different digits, such that",,
5,Mystery Fractions - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
6,Mystery Fractions - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Students may begin by looking at various fractions equivalent to 5/6 and use trial and error to find a fraction that meets the given conditions. Along with developing strategies for solving the problem, students should be encouraged to keep a record of what does and does not work in their process of investigating the problem.",,
7,Mystery Fractions - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,TEACHER NOTES FOR IMPLEMENTATION,,
8,Mystery Fractions - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"This activity is intended to take approximately one 90-minute class period. Students should work in small groups throughout the activity and discuss their reasoning within groups. After working in their small groups, the students should come together as a whole class to share their results.",,
9,Mystery Fractions - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"To introduce the activity, we suggest reviewing basic divisibility rules by asking students to describe their experiences with divisibility. For example, ask students what comes to mind when they think of the phrases â€œdivisible byâ€ or â€œa divides b.â€ Record the studentsâ€™ ideas on the board or overhead as a starting point for a class discussion on what divisibility means and then formalize the definition: a divides b if b = aq for some integer q.",,
10,Mystery Fractions - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,DIVISIBILITY RULES AND REASONS,,
11,Mystery Fractions - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In the first part of the activity, ask students to complete a table of divisibility rules and give reasoning for why the rules work. Then have a class discussion about the divisibility rules and the appropriate reasoning for these rules. These written rules will be useful references at various points in the activity.",,
12,Mystery Fractions - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Question 1 of the activity sheet presents the main problem of this activity, to find distinct integers A, B, and C, such that",,
13,Mystery Fractions - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
14,Mystery Fractions - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"An observation that some students in our classroom made was that ABC <CBA because its equivalent fraction 5/6 is less than 1. Using place value understanding, the students should conclude that A<C. A second observation made by students in our classroom was that the numerator, ABC, must be a three-digit integer and divisible by 5. This led the students back to the divisibility rule for 5 to conclude that C must be 0 or 5. Similarly, the integer in the denominator, CBA, must be divisible by 6. This forces A to be an even number and C to equal 5. An example may be in order here, showing that the multiples of 5 in the numerator and multiples of 6 in the denominator must both be scaled with the same factor.",,
15,Mystery Fractions - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Students may connect the possible choices for A and C, determined earlier, to maintain the fraction ratio of 5/6. Here the teacher should encourage the students to discuss their reasoning. The use of the divisibility rules for 2, 3, 5, and 6 can be useful tools for further narrowing down the possibilities for the three digits. If ABC is a multiple of 5, what can we say about any of the digits? If CBA is a multiple of 6, what can we say about any of the digits?",,
16,Mystery Fractions - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,The student work in figure 1 illustrates a systematic approach to solving the problem.,,

24,Mystery Fractions - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"(with the same sign in the numerator and denominator) will maintain the same ratio of 5/6. This student began with 500/600 and performed this operation by subtracting 5 from the numerator and 6 from the denominator. In using a scale factor strategy, the students should recognize that a ratio of the form 5x/6y with x not equal to y would not work. Also, note that y must not be 0 for this to work. A challenging moment arose in our class when students were uncertain why one could subtract 5 from the numerator of the fraction 500/600 and 6 from the denominator, obtain 495/594, and claim that this result was equivalent to 5/6; recall above that when we multiplied the numerator and denominator, to maintain the same ratio, we multiplied by the same number. A class discussion ensued about whether the ratio",,
25,Mystery Fractions - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Â,,
26,Mystery Fractions - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,where x â‰  0 is maintained when subtracting a number p from the numerator and q from the denominator. The class determined that the ratio will be maintained as long as,,
27,Mystery Fractions - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
28,Mystery Fractions - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,the ratio will not be maintained otherwise.,,
29,Mystery Fractions - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
30,Mystery Fractions - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"we obtain 6 â€¢ ABC = 5 â€¢ CBA. We can observe from this that ABC must be divisible by 5, or C must be 0 or 5. Because CBA cannot begin with 0, C must be 5. Then we notice that since CBA must be divisible by 6, A must be even, so 2, 4, 6, or 8 (A cannot be 0 for the same reason that C cannot). Since ABC must be smaller than CBA, we have that A must be 2 or 4. We consider the two cases below:",,
31,Mystery Fractions - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"â€¢ In the case of A = 4, we have",,

34,Mystery Fractions - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,6(400 + 10B +5) = 5(500 + 10B + 4),,
35,Mystery Fractions - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,or,,
36,Mystery Fractions - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,2400 + 60B + 30 = 2500 + 50B + 20,,

43,Mystery Fractions - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In our class, we had our students make a poster (see fig. 2) of different strategies they came up with in solving question 1.",,
44,Mystery Fractions - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
45,Mystery Fractions - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Question 2 considers a variation of question 1, which uses the same principles but is slightly more complex because there is more than one answer possible. Again, some students may approach it through the divisibility method by keeping an organized list, whereas others may try the scale factor method and systematically reason until they discover all possible answers.",,
46,Mystery Fractions - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Students should connect the reasoning in this question to the reasoning in the previous problem. From prior knowledge, the students might multiply both the numerator and denominator by the same nonzero number and keep the same ratio. They must, however, limit this to multiplying by numbers that do not produce a number with more than three digits. Some students may take an algebraic approach to the problem in conjunction with their knowledge of divisibility rules. Figure 3 shows a sample of student work using this method.",,
47,Mystery Fractions - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
48,Mystery Fractions - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Question 3 asks students to think of another strategy to solve the problem and to find all possible solutions. Teachers are encouraged to have a class discussion about various strategies that students find. Groups of students can give a brief presentation of their work.,,
49,Mystery Fractions - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,AN EXPLORATION WITH MULTIPLE STRATEGIES,,
50,Mystery Fractions - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In this activity, students discover a â€œmystery fractionâ€ based on a few constraints. They will enjoy the process of limiting the possibilities as they engage in an exploration of divisibility rules, use of reasoning, and important attributes of fractions. By considering a mystery fraction that satisfies certain conditions for the numerator and denominator, there is a satisfaction in finally finding the unique answer. Then, by relaxing the constraints, the number of solutions increases. An important aspect of this problem is that multiple strategies that students may initially try are all accessible to middle school students, such as using divisibility rules or beginning with a natural choice of fraction, such as",,
51,Mystery Fractions - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
52,Mystery Fractions - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"and manipulating it. Thus, engaging in this type of problem not only strengthens studentsâ€™ problem-solving strategies but also deepens studentsâ€™ understanding of important middle school mathematics concepts.",,
