A compound probability task and rich classroom discussion  promote high-level understanding.,1,mtms2010-11-208a,,
"iIt is important to use rich problem- solving tasks to develop students’ understanding of important mathematical ideas (NCTM 2000). Rich tasks are complex, nonalgorithmic, and nonroutine, requiring reasoning, problem solving, and communication of thinking. ",2,mtms2010-11-208a,,
"Stein and Smith (1998) called these items tasks with higher-level  cognitive demand. They employ multiple representations, require students to make connections between procedures and concepts, and do not have a clear-cut path to a solution. These tasks create opportunities for student-centered class discussion: They are deep enough to be worthy of continued analysis and open enough to generate a broad variety of student  solutions and realizations that will sustain a productive class discussion.",3,mtms2010-11-208a,,
Evidence has shown that using rich tasks in student-centered classrooms is especially conducive to productive student learning (Stein et al. 2000; Wertsch and Toma 1995; Wood 1995). Yet research also shows that using complex tasks and developing student-centered classrooms  can be intimidating and challenging (Borko and Livingston 1989; Chazan and Ball 1999; Heaton 2000). What is the best way to use student-generated work on such tasks to guide a productive whole-class discussion? ,4,mtms2010-11-208a,,
"The “five practices” model outlines how to do just that (Smith et al. 2009; Stein et al. 2008). Through the use of these five practices emphasizing planning and extending instructional decision time, the model makes studentcentered discussions more manageable and more mathematically productive. These five practices, or steps, include the following: ",5,mtms2010-11-208a,,
"Step 1:   Anticipating student responses  to tasks,",6,mtms2010-11-208a,,

"Step 3:  Selecting student responses to be shared in whole-class feedback discussions,",8,mtms2010-11-208a,,
"Step 4:  Purposefully sequencing the student work to be shared in a mathematically productive order, and ",9,mtms2010-11-208a,,
Step 5: Helping students make connections between different students’ responses and between student responses and important mathematical ideas. ,10,mtms2010-11-208a,,
We also added a precursory first step:,11,mtms2010-11-208a,,
Step 0: Selecting the appropriate rich  task to meet the intended mathematical goal(s). ,12,mtms2010-11-208a,,
We will show how we used these six practices to implement a rich probability task with preservice K−8 teachers.  iMpleMenting the practices,13,mtms2010-11-208a,,
"Step 0: Selecting the appropriate rich task to meet the intended mathematical goal(s). For this unit, our mathematical goal was to build an understanding of compound probability, which  includes knowing how and why we multiply the probabilities of two independent events to determine the probability of the compound outcome. That, in turn, requires understanding what independent events are, how to break down a given outcome into its separate events (getting a sum of 3 on two successive rolls of a die means getting a 1 and then a 2, or a 2 and then a 1), and why considering independent events is necessary. Understanding why requires making the connection between multiplying in a discrete tree-diagram model and multiplying in a continuous-area model, such as when using a spinner.",14,mtms2010-11-208a,,
"Instead of initially giving students techniques for calculating compound probabilities, such as generating tree diagrams, we followed the recommendations in the Grade 6−8 Data Analysis and Probability section of NCTM’s Standards: Students should first predict probabilities and then collect experimental data to compare with their predictions (NCTM 2000). We engineered a rich task requiring the students to confront misconceptions and recognize key aspects about determining likelihoods. We deliberately wanted to postpone giving them techniques for calculating compound probabilities until we thought they were ready, after they had gotten a chance to make and share their realizations. The rich task we selected was the “double spin game” (see fig. 1). Before reading on, think about how you would design the spinner if given this task.",15,mtms2010-11-208a,,
"Step 1: Anticipating student responses to tasks. We focus on the important realizations, strategies, and ideas that students will make as they work. From past experience, we anticipated that many students would divide their spinners into equal sections, and that some would place the same number in several different, separated sections of the spinner. We also expected many ",16,mtms2010-11-208a,,
"Fig. 1 With the “double spin game,” students design their own spinners and find out which design works best.  ",17,mtms2010-11-208a,,
"You and your partner will each design a spinner. You may choose how and where to draw the sector lines and which numbers go in each sector. Play the following game against  your partner: When it is your turn, twirl your spinner twice and record your double spin—the sum of the two numbers—on your tally chart. Your partner then takes a turn and records the double spin on his or her tally chart. Continue taking turns until someone wins the round. The winner is the first person to record each of the following sums: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.",18,mtms2010-11-208a,,

"students to eventually recognize the need to increase the size of the sections devoted to 1 and 4 to make the outcomes that were more rare, like 2 and 8, more probable, but we expected few students to use probability calculations to defend such a choice.",24,mtms2010-11-208a,,
"Step 2: Monitoring student responses to tasks. This phase occurs while students work on the task and before they submit their results. While students were at work, we observed them and listened to their discussions with group members. We asked questions about their reasoning and requested that they record more detailed descriptions of their reasoning on the activity sheet, when necessary. Students worked on the task for most of day 1 and day 2 (50-minute class sessions). After day 2, all class work was collected. The activity sheets were reviewed to determine the strategies that students used and the reasoning behind those strategies.",25,mtms2010-11-208a,,
Steps 3 and 4: Selecting student responses to be shared in whole-class discussions and purposefully sequencing the student work. These steps require a deliberate selection and ordering of student work to be shared in class the following day. The idea is not to simply pick some examples of basic and advanced student work but to select examples that display important realizations about the task and challenge misconceptions observed during the monitoring phase. The work should also support the mathematical goal of determining compound probabilities. We sequenced the papers by paying attention to the way that some realizations relied on others. ,26,mtms2010-11-208a,,
Step 5: Helping students make connections. The following discussion of student work elaborates on this step.,27,mtms2010-11-208a,,
Determining the realizations  requires background knowledge and experience. We have found that the clearer one is in setting out the math-,28,mtms2010-11-208a,,
"Using a rich task and student work to teach a concept requires flexibility on the part of  the teacher.  ematical goals of the unit, the easier it will be to determine the important realizations to focus on when selecting student work. For instance, one goal was for students to learn why to multiply the probabilities of two independent events to determine the compound probability. This idea required breaking down the outcome into equally likely events, such as equally likely ways to get a 4 on two spins. It also required believing that the two spins were independent. By recognizing when a student has made such an important realization, it can be used to guide a productive class discussion.  selecting and seQUencing stUdent WorK",29,mtms2010-11-208a,,
"Here are, in order, the six responses that we picked for students to present on day 3 and the important realizations about the task.  1. Brigid. To start the class, we  asked Brigid to show her first spinner, the results of her first game, and her revised second spinner to the class (see fig. 2). She was also asked to explain why she made the changes: “Mine before was 1−6 and my numbers were too large most of the time.” She deleted the 5 and the 6, thus eliminating the possibility of the extraneous outcomes of 9, 10, 11, and 12. This work resulted in our first realization.",30,mtms2010-11-208a,,
" Realization A: Excluding numbers other than 1, 2, 3, and 4 eliminates extraneous outcomes. ",31,mtms2010-11-208a,,
"Fig. 2 Brigid needed to eliminate numbers other than 1, 2, 3, and 4 to avoid extraneous outcomes.",32,mtms2010-11-208a,,
(a) Brigid’s first spinner (b) Brigid’s first game (c) Brigid’s second spinner,33,mtms2010-11-208a,,
"The spinner of our next presenter, Allison, displayed this idea more completely.  2. Allison. Allison’s results from her second game, her third spinner (see fig. 3), and why she had modified her spinner were discussed next. Her work was chosen for two reasons. Her second spinner could be used to introduce the notion of independent events. On her activity sheet, Allison wrote, “I put the two same numbers diagonally from each other so that they would be as far apart as possible.” She thought that spins were not really random: If your last spin landed in a ",34,mtms2010-11-208a,,
"Fig. 3 In addition to demonstrating sector size, Allison’s spinners helped students think about independent events.",35,mtms2010-11-208a,,
Fig. 4 Lisa’s second spinner (a) alongside Allison’s third spinner (b) led to a discussion of whether number placement matters.,36,mtms2010-11-208a,,
"(a) Allison’s second spinner (a)  (b) (b) Allison’s first game (c) Allison’s third spinner particular sector, your next spin was less likely than usual to land in that same sector. Unless the class could agree with realization B (below), we would be unable to establish realization C (also below):  Realization B: Consecutive spins are independent events.",37,mtms2010-11-208a,,
 Realization C: Placement of the numbers on the spinner does not matter. ,38,mtms2010-11-208a,,
"In class, the teacher discussed how learners have difficulty understanding  when consecutive events are independent. For instance, if a student flips a coin and gets heads four times in a row, instead of viewing the next flip as having equal odds for heads or tails, he may believe that he is due for a tails or that he is on a streak and will get heads next. ",39,mtms2010-11-208a,,
The second reason we chose  ,40,mtms2010-11-208a,,
"Allison’s spinners was to emphasize the connection between probability and sector size. On her activity sheet, she said that in the second game she always seemed to be waiting on the 2 and the 8. So she increased the size of a 1 and a 4 to better her chance of getting 2s and 8s.  3. Lisa. We placed Lisa’s second  spinner next to Allison’s third spinner (see fig. 4) on the overhead projector to foster a discussion of realization C. In addition, Lisa had written this on her activity sheet: “I would also advise making the sections 1 and 4 larger than the sections for 3 and 2. I found this is more successful because it is hardest to spin 2s and 8s.”   Realization D: Numbers with a larger space on the spinner have a greater probability of being landed on. Specifically, larger spaces for 1 and 4 increase the probability of getting a sum of 2 or 8.",41,mtms2010-11-208a,,
"A number of other students had  also made this realization. When they played the games, they saw that 2 and 8 were the toughest outcomes to get and that making the 1 and 4 areas larger would help make these outcomes more likely. But how much larger should they be? Was there any way to determine mathematically how large to make the 1 and the 4 compared with the 2 and the 3? 4. Mary. We chose these spinners and reasoning to discuss the idea of enumerating the different ways to get each outcome (see fig. 5). Mary wrote, “I realized I needed more options to get the ‘hard to get’ numbers (like 7 and 8 and 2 and 3). I had lots of ways to get 4, 5, and 6.” Because Mary, unlike Lisa, paid attention to the number of ways to get each outcome, she could produce a reason why 2 was tougher to get than 5: “The only way to get a 2 is two 1s.” She used tables to show how she counted these combinations. Her work suggests that she was trying to figure out how to “equalize the probability of getting each number.” Mary’s method of counting was not quite correct because she increased the number of sectors without really changing the areas allotted to each number. Nevertheless, she made the next crucial point:",42,mtms2010-11-208a,,
Fig. 5 Mary’s second and third spinners (a) helped explore how to enumerate the ways to achieve each outcome (b) and (c).,43,mtms2010-11-208a,,

There also was less of a chance of getting a really high number like 9 or 10 because there is only a 1/8 probability that we could get a 5.” Her explanation produced the next realization.,45,mtms2010-11-208a,,
 Realization F: The probability of spinning a particular number on one spin is the same as the total fraction of the pie taken up by that number.,46,mtms2010-11-208a,,
" Realization E: Part of determining probability is counting the number of ways to get each outcome.  5. Alyssa. We picked Alyssa to  present her third spinner to address the shortcomings in Mary’s work, specifically, to highlight the fact that probability depends on the size of the desired sector rather than the number of the desired sectors (see fig. 6). Alyssa had written this on her activity sheet: “This spinner design is superior to my first one because there were more ways to get lower numbers because there was a 1/4 probability to  getting particular outcomes after two spins. We had planned to have the teacher ask the class, “If Alyssa is correct that the probability of spinning a 5 is 1/8, then what is the probability of spinning a 10 on two spins?” However, the class discussed this without the teacher having to ask. ",47,mtms2010-11-208a,,
"Two different answers were proposed by students: (a) 2/8, because  1/8 + 1/8 = 2/8; and (b) 2/16, because if you put two identical spinners side by side, two sectors with the number 5 each take up 1/16 of the total area, for a combined proportion of 2/16 of the total area. A lively discussion commenced about the respective merits of these two techniques.",48,mtms2010-11-208a,,
"6. Jesenia. The final presenter was Jesenia, not because her spinner was best but because she proposed a third way to calculate probability: by using multiplication instead of addition. She explained that applying her technique to figure out Alyssa’s chance of getting a 10 produced answer (c): 1/64, because 1/8 × 1/8 = 1/64. Jesenia’s explanation became the next important point to discuss.",49,mtms2010-11-208a,,
"After this discussion, we wanted the class to use Alyssa’s strategy to do what Mary had been trying to do, namely, to calculate the probability of   Realization G: The probability of event A and then event B happening on independent trials is  P(A) × P(B). ",50,mtms2010-11-208a,,
"Class time was running out, so the teacher summarized the three proposed methods of calculating compound probabilities. ",51,mtms2010-11-208a,,
FolloWing Up,52,mtms2010-11-208a,,
"We did not expect the students to get a full understanding of the techniques for calculating compound probability from the spinner task and the discussions alone. The task was meant to produce the crucial realizations that readied the students for understanding these techniques. For this reason, the teacher presented an activity with two coin flips and an activity with two dice on day 4. She showed the students how to make tree diagrams to determine the number of equally probable ways of getting a particular outcome compared with the total number of outcomes.",53,mtms2010-11-208a,,
"By appealing to the combinations  model of multiplication, the class could then discuss why the best of the three proposed ways to calculate the compound probability of independent events was by multiplying two probabilities, not adding. Equipped with realization G, the students were asked on day 5 to revisit their spinners and determine which spinner in each group was best by calculating probabilities.",54,mtms2010-11-208a,,
"At the end of day 5, our students  had achieved our learning goals about compound probability, but they still did not all agree on an optimal spinner design. We think this is one feature of a rich task—it keeps the door open for further mathematical exploration.  discUssion",55,mtms2010-11-208a,,
"Teachers often voice concerns that they do not have time to implement rich tasks and student-centered discussion in the classroom. We believe that we got better results by spending four days exploring and productively discussing one rich task, plus one interposed day of supplemental activities, than by dedicating the same week to lecture and textbook exercises ",56,mtms2010-11-208a,,
"The clearer someone is in setting out the  mathematical goals  of the unit, the easier it will be to  determine the  important  realizations to focus on when selecting  student work.",57,mtms2010-11-208a,,
on compound probability. ,58,mtms2010-11-208a,,
"Although the task in itself did not address every element of compound probability, it served as an engaging and mathematically rich context in which to build important mathematical ideas. The activities on day 4 gave students techniques for calculating the probabilities associated with their spinners. Our students were very interested in determining whose spinner was best so they were motivated to understand compound probability as a tool to evaluate spinner quality.",59,mtms2010-11-208a,,
"By teaching compound probability in this way, we learned that it really is possible to use a rich task with a few augmentations to teach an important mathematic concept. We were delighted to see how— 1.  engaged and motivated the students were by the task, and 2.  they demonstrated understanding  of compound probability on the final test.",60,mtms2010-11-208a,,
"In fact, they clamored to have a difficult compound probability problem on  the final test, which they all answered correctly. Although the focus of the lesson was on the mathematics, our students noticed that we were purposely using their work to structure the lesson. This created an opportunity to have discussions with our preservice teachers about using student work in their own classrooms. ",61,mtms2010-11-208a,,
"We were fortunate that our students generated or provided entry points to discuss the realizations we felt were critical to build the important concepts of compound probability. However, there were gaps in their reasoning, and we addressed these  accordingly. In particular, the activity on day 4 was not fully planned prior to the students working on the “double spin game” but rather was selected to resolve the questions generated by students about the correct method for calculating compound probabilities. ",62,mtms2010-11-208a,,
"Using a rich task and student work  to teach a concept does require flexibility on the part of the teacher to respond to issues, manage discussions, and fill in gaps as they arise. However, we found the benefits in student engagement and learning are well worth the effort.",63,mtms2010-11-208a,,
