0,A Classroom Hands-on Tool_ Exploring Height - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Measurement is a prominent topic of study in mathematics because of its practicability in so many areas of life (CCSSI 2010; NCTM 2000). Solving triangle area problems appears in the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSI 2010) for grade 6 geometry. The focus is on understanding the area formula for triangles by relating the shapes to rectangles. It is crucial to have a concrete understanding of how to find the height of a triangle to apply the area formula for triangles.,,
1,A Classroom Hands-on Tool_ Exploring Height - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"As teachers, we see our students (irrespective of grade level) struggle when working with the height of a triangle. Although students may be comfortable finding the height of acute triangles with horizontal bases, confusion arises when the triangle is obtuse or when the base is not horizontal to the bottom of the page. The concept of height is confusing because the height may lie either inside or outside or on a side of the triangle.",,
2,A Classroom Hands-on Tool_ Exploring Height - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,The activity described here provides students a hands-on approach to problem solving. These activities can be used with middle school students who have knowledge of perpendicular and parallel lines.,,
3,A Classroom Hands-on Tool_ Exploring Height - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,ACTIVITY 1: FINDING TRIANGLE HEIGHT,,
4,A Classroom Hands-on Tool_ Exploring Height - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,A triangle is a closed shape in a plane with three straight sides and three vertices. The base of a triangle can be any one of the three sides of the triangle. The height of a triangle is the line segment perpendicular to the base that connects the base or an extension of the base to the vertex of the triangle (not on the base) (Beckmann 2010).,,
5,A Classroom Hands-on Tool_ Exploring Height - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In a more systematic way, one can explain height in the following steps:",,
6,A Classroom Hands-on Tool_ Exploring Height - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Step 1: Choose a base of the triangle.,,
7,A Classroom Hands-on Tool_ Exploring Height - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Step 2: Locate the vertex that is not on the chosen base (i.e., find the vertex of the triangle that is different from the endpoints of the chosen base).",,
8,A Classroom Hands-on Tool_ Exploring Height - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Step 3: Draw a perpendicular segment from the vertex to the base or the line that includes the base of the triangle. The perpendicular line segment is the height of the triangle.,,
9,A Classroom Hands-on Tool_ Exploring Height - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"After briefly discussing the height of a triangle, give students activity sheet 1 consisting of different types of triangles with a marked base. Ask them to draw the height of the triangles. In my classes, all the students usually respond correctly when the triangles are acute triangles. However, very few of the students draw the height correctly when the triangles are obtuse. Figure 1 shows various responses concerning the height of one of the obtuse triangles.",,

11,A Classroom Hands-on Tool_ Exploring Height - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,ACTIVITY 2: MAKING THE L-SHAPED TOOL,,
12,A Classroom Hands-on Tool_ Exploring Height - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The three steps described above can be made simpler by constructing a tool. To create the tool, students must have an understanding of perpendicular lines. Two lines are said to be perpendicular if they meet at right angles, as shown in figure 2, where angle ABD is congruent to angle ABC, or they measure 90 degrees. Omitting segment BC, the perpendicular looks like an L shape. Therefore, the perpendicular from the vertex to the base of the triangle can be considered an L shape.",,

14,A Classroom Hands-on Tool_ Exploring Height - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,FINDING TRIANGLE HEIGHT,,
15,A Classroom Hands-on Tool_ Exploring Height - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Students use an index card, scissors, a ruler, and a pencil to create an L-shaped tool to better understand the height of a triangle (see activity sheet 2). Use the ruler to make dotted lines that are parallel to adjacent sides of the index card (see fig. 3a). Students cut along the dotted lines up to the point of intersection to produce an L-shaped tool (see fig. 3b). It will have one vertical side and one horizontal side. Since the tool can be rotated depending on the orientation of the triangle, the sides may not always remain vertical or horizontal, respectively.",,

17,A Classroom Hands-on Tool_ Exploring Height - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,HOW THE L-SHAPED TOOL WORKS,,
18,A Classroom Hands-on Tool_ Exploring Height - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"To use the L-shaped tool, students select a side of the triangle designated the base. Encourage students to",,
19,A Classroom Hands-on Tool_ Exploring Height - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,1. extend the base of the triangle by extending the line segments on either side of the base;,,
20,A Classroom Hands-on Tool_ Exploring Height - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,2. identify the vertex that is not on the chosen base;,,
21,A Classroom Hands-on Tool_ Exploring Height - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,3. align the horizontal side of the tool with the base of the triangle; and,,
22,A Classroom Hands-on Tool_ Exploring Height - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,4. slide the tool along the base of the triangle until the vertical side meets the vertex opposite the base of the triangle.,,
23,A Classroom Hands-on Tool_ Exploring Height - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Draw the line segment along the vertical side of the L-shaped tool from the chosen vertex to the base (or extended base) of the triangle (see fig. 4a). If the vertical side of the tool is not long enough to extend to the vertex, extend the vertical leg of the tool to represent the height of the triangle (see fig. 4b). Use a ruler to draw the perpendicular line segment representing the height of the triangle from the vertex to the base (or extended base) of the triangle.",,

25,A Classroom Hands-on Tool_ Exploring Height - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,ACTIVITY 3: FINDING TRIANGLE HEIGHT USING THE TOOL,,
26,A Classroom Hands-on Tool_ Exploring Height - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"After students have made their own tool, demonstrate the L-shaped tool and discuss how and why it works. Hand out activity sheet 3 for finding the height of triangles using the tool. Students work individually using the tool. Most of my students give correct responses for the height of the obtuse triangles when they use the tool. Working in groups, the students discuss their work on one of the obtuse triangles from the task. After the discussion, the remaining students will usually complete the task successfully.",,
27,A Classroom Hands-on Tool_ Exploring Height - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Consider the responses of three students. In figure 5, one student first extended the base of the triangle and answered questions (a) and (b) and then used the L-shaped tool to put the pointer at the vertex A. The shape was then moved until it was over the base of the triangle.",,
28,A Classroom Hands-on Tool_ Exploring Height - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
29,A Classroom Hands-on Tool_ Exploring Height - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Figure 6 shows the work of another student who drew the height correctly on a different obtuse triangle using the tool. This student responded that C is extended. Emphasize to students that line segment AC is extended rather than vertex C to focus on precision in writing mathematical solutions, which is one of the Standards for Mathematical Practice (CCSSI 2010).",,

31,A Classroom Hands-on Tool_ Exploring Height - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Figure 7 demonstrates another students response to the parallelogram problem (see problem 3 on activity sheet 3), where students are to find the height of a parallelogram. This question is intended to provide a different setting in which students could use their understanding of the height of a triangle to determine the height of a parallelogram. The student drew the heights from both the vertices A and B to the base CD.",,

33,A Classroom Hands-on Tool_ Exploring Height - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,BUILDING A FOUNDATION FOR OTHER CONCEPTS,,
34,A Classroom Hands-on Tool_ Exploring Height - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"This hands-on approach will help students appreciate and understand the idea of triangle height and build the foundation for other mathematical concepts, such as area of a parallelogram. This tool and variations of associated activities may help students focus on identifying the vertex, not simply identifying the base. Since students know the height is the vertical leg of the L-shaped tool, no matter where the base is, students can move the tool to make the horizontal leg of the tool either sit on or be parallel to the base. Hence, this tool reduces the frequent confusion students have when finding the height of obtuse triangles.",,
