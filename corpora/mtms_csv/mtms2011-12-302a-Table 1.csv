"Exponential growth is the engine that drives the ambitions of financial investors. Studying this growth in a financial context gives middle school students a vivid introduction to a nonlinear relationship and its powerful implications. In this activity, grandparents invest $10,000 in a student’s name on the day the student is born. The growth of this money over a lifetime is studied under three different annual percent increases: 5 percent, 10 percent, and 20 percent. Students make detailed calculations and reflect on the implications of their findings. The context is that safer investments, such as a savings account in a bank, give small but guaranteed percent increases. Riskier investments, such as stocks, have no guarantees but can lead to much higher percent increases. ",2,mtms2011-12-302a,,
"A more streamlined approach  involves a one-step calculation based on the recognition that an 8 percent increase means the new value after  1 year is 108 percent of the original, or  1.08 × $15,000 = $16,200.",3,mtms2011-12-302a,,
"To calculate the amount of money after a second year, the new value is 1.08 × $16,200, and so on.",4,mtms2011-12-302a,,
"For longer terms, such as 25 years, it can be cumbersome to determine the value of the investment by repeatedly calculating the result from one year to the next. A more powerful approach is to recognize an exponential pattern for the growth by writing out the multiplications, as shown in table 1 for a $50,000 investment with a  6 percent annual return.",5,mtms2011-12-302a,,
"The essence of exponential growth can be encapsulated by calculating the change under any 2 successive years of a fixed percent increase. Consider the investment in table 1. The first-year increase is 6 percent of $50,000, or $3000, resulting in a total of $53,000 after 1 year. The second-year increase is 6 percent of $53,000, or $3180, resulting in a total of $56,180 after 2 years. The second year’s increase is $180 larger than the first year’s increase. The increase from one year to the next is itself growing, because the 6 percent increase applies to a greater ",6,mtms2011-12-302a,,
PreliMinaries  to the investigation,7,mtms2011-12-302a,,
The most basic way to calculate the increase in money from one year to the next involves a two-step calculation: Calculate the interest and add it to the principle. Consider this example.,8,mtms2011-12-302a,,
" A $15,000 investment with an  8 percent annual return: •	 Calculate	the	interest:	  8 percent of $15,000, or  0.08 × $15,000 = $1200 •	 Add	that	figure	to	the	principal:	 $15,000 + $1200 = $16,200",9,mtms2011-12-302a,,

"Teachers have flexibility regarding how much to instruct students on these preliminaries. Given a fixed percent increase, calculating the increase from one year to the next is generally straightforward for students with any prior exposure to working with percents. The exponential pattern is difficult for students to discover, and at least some teacher prompting may be necessary to help students work through the “Total $ for . . .” columns in table 1. The feedback effect, resulting in increasingly larger growth, can usually be explained by students when they are asked what happens to the size of the increase from one year to the next. It does not detract from the spontaneity of the investigation, however, if teachers initiate students  table 2 The numbers illustrate what will happen to the $10,000 investments when left to grow for 10 years.",12,mtms2011-12-302a,,

"This activity is best completed in small groups to encourage mutual checks on calculations and discussion of results. Scientific calculators  are required. Although some teachers might wish to use graphing calculators for the activity, asking students to make graphs by hand plays a role in helping them get a feel for graphs of exponential growth. Students first calculate the value of their $10,000 investments up to age 10, as shown in table 2. They then graph the results ",15,mtms2011-12-302a,,
"Fig. 1 The 5 percent, 10 percent, and 20 percent benchmarks illustrate what 10 years and $10,000 can accomplish in (a); leaving the money alone for 30 years produces (b).",16,mtms2011-12-302a,,
investment comparison for 10 Years (a) investment comparison for 30 Years (b) in figure 1a by making scatter plots of the data and joining the points with smooth curves. ,17,mtms2011-12-302a,,
"Students are told that all three  investment graphs are to appear on the same grid and that they should construct one graph at a time to avoid mixing data points from different investments. (Using a different colored pencil for each graph will also help keep them separated.) Some students might require assistance with plotting points because they will need to estimate locations along the vertical coordinate. However, most students will be able to jump right into making reasonable graphs. The worst that can happen is a little wobbling of the graphs because of estimation errors. Students will be asked to write about their findings and reflect on their calculations. As students perform detailed calculations, usually an inherently quiet task, there is ample opportunity to circulate around the room and ask:  •	 Why	are	your	graphs	curving	up? •	 How	does	the	20	percent	graph	 compare with the other investments?	 •	 How	much	do	you	predict	the	 money will be worth by the time you	are	30?	By	the	time	you	are	60?	 •	 Is	it	realistic	to	have	sustained	 20 percent growth over many years?	 •	 What	will	happen	to	prices	of	 everyday	items	when	you	are	60?	 •	 How	much	did	a	movie	ticket	cost	 50	years	ago?	 •	 If	a	person	purchased	$10,000	 worth of Apple stock in the early 1980s, what might it be worth now?	 •	 What	happened	to	the	stock	market	a	few	years	ago?	",18,mtms2011-12-302a,,
"The informal discussion plays an essential role in engaging student curiosity and bringing the activity to  life. It is also helpful to keep returning to the context of the $10,000 gift and the student’s age: “If you could get  20 percent growth, that would mean you would have more than $60,000 by the time you were 10.”",19,mtms2011-12-302a,,
"Students are modestly impressed by  the short-term results and recognize that the larger percent increases give an increasingly bigger payoff (this  is especially noticeable with the  20 percent graph). The curved nature of the graphs is dramatic only for the 20 percent graph. Some students question whether the 5 percent graph looks curved, but generally students recognize that the graphs are curving up. Most students are able to articulate that when the investment grows, the increase will be larger the next year. Such recognition is made concrete by drawing students into the specifics	of	their	calculations.	When	asked	 why the 10 percent investment grows by $1000 in the first year and $1100 in the second year, most students are quick to describe the feedback effect described earlier of increasing growth and curving graphs. It takes further calculations for students to absorb and digest the implications of the idea. ",20,mtms2011-12-302a,,
"Students next calculate the value of their investments in 5-year increments up to age 30, as shown in table 3, and then graph the results in figure 1b. Calculating the increase from one year to the next is a slow process at this time scale. Instead, students can either use the exponent formula to move to the desired result (find the 5 percent investment value at age 25 by calculating $10,000 × 1.0525) or move in increments of 5 years (find the 5 percent investment value at age 25 by multiplying the age 20 investment value by 1.055). The continued progression of detailed calculations and handmade graphs helps students internalize the process of exponential growth better than a lecture, notes, discussion, or individual homework questions. The  steady growth of an investment over a span of years can produce interesting results in both a graph and an account.  table 3 A 30-year investment of $10,000 produces dramatic gains over time. ",21,mtms2011-12-302a,,
"Your age (in Years) total $ for 5% increase total $ for 10% increase total $ for 20% increase 10 15 20 25 30 $10,000 $12,762.82 $16,288.95 $20,789.28 $26,532.98 $33,863.55 $43,219.42 $10,000 $16,105.10 $25,937.42 $41,772.48 $67,275.00 $108,347.06 $174,494.02 $10,000 $24,883.20 $61,917.36 $154,070.22 $383,376.00 $953,962.17 $2,373,763.14 students are getting a chance to experience exponential growth as it happens. Each increase in the investment fuels an even larger increase, which in turn fuels an even larger increase, and so on, until explosive growth appears to occur for sufficiently large percent increases.",22,mtms2011-12-302a,,
"Compared with the modestly impressive 10-year growth, the 30-year growth is striking. The payoff of a larger percent increase becomes even clearer over a long time span as the   20 percent graph overwhelms the  5 percent and 10 percent graphs. Students see the temptation of riskier investments and the advantage of larger percent increases. Some question the validity of their 20 percent calculations when they see the graph shoot off the grid before 30 years. Most are impressed with even the 10 percent result of having more than $170,000 by age 30. The 5 percent growth is less impressive, and the curved nature  table 4 The $10,000 investments after 60 years (rounded to the nearest dollar)  produce even more dramatic graphs.  investment type  (annual increase) 5% 10% 20% total $ after 60 Years $10,000 × 1.0560 = $186,792 $10,000 × 1.1060 = $3,044,816 $10,000 × 1.2060 = $563,475,144 of the 5 percent graph remains difficult to see on a grid whose vertical scale is large enough to contain most of the 20 percent graph. To make the curved nature of the 5 percent graph more apparent, the teacher could show students, or ask them to construct, the same 5 percent graph on a grid whose vertical scale ranges from only $0 to $45,000.",23,mtms2011-12-302a,,
The activity’s final calculation  of the investment’s value by age 60 showcases the true power of exponential growth (see table 4). Students admire the 10 percent investment value of more than 3 million dollars and are in awe of the 20 percent investment value of more than 500 million dollars.  debrieFing,24,mtms2011-12-302a,,
"Perhaps the biggest payoff of the activity is debriefing after all calculations are done. The investigation, with time for student writing and informal discussion during calculations, can be comfortably completed in one class period plus one night’s homework. Budgeting	time	in	a	subsequent	class	 to debrief will result in vibrant class discussion and added perspectives. A small sampling of some of the possible follow-up discussion points are described. ",25,mtms2011-12-302a,,
"First, the calculations show the importance of time in unleashing the power of exponential growth. The longer the growth time, the more striking the value of the investments. Investing early in life, such as  contributing to a retirement plan in one’s twenties, can result in dramatic growth by retirement age. ",26,mtms2011-12-302a,,
"Second, when students are asked which type of investment they would pick, invariably the loudest response is, “Of course, the 20 percent one!” It is important to return to the opening idea of risk taking. High percent increases generally cannot be achieved with safe, obvious investments, or else we would all be rich. Those who pursue safer investments must be content with smaller percent increases. Those who pursue riskier investments must be prepared to accept that a 20 percent increase one year may be followed by a 50 percent loss the next year. The striking growth from a sustained  20 percent annual increase reflects the dream of every investor. However, the risks are real that impressive growth can be replaced by dramatic losses. These observations can lead to a rich discussion about what are safer or riskier investments and the historical context behind different types of investments, such as stocks and real estate. For example, although financial advisers describe stock values growing exponentially over the long term, substantial corrections can occur, as seen over the last decade. ",27,mtms2011-12-302a,,
"Third, when some students proudly  say that they would not risk their money and would be content with smaller growth, add a real-life context. Students can be asked to think about what will happen to the cost of living over the course of a student’s lifetime. ",28,mtms2011-12-302a,,
"A $30,000 home in 1972 might cost $400,000 in 2012. A 50 cent movie ticket in the 1950s might cost $10 in 2012. The cost of living can grow exponentially as well, and this reality can force investors to take at least some risk to outpace inflation. ",29,mtms2011-12-302a,,
"The debriefing is best completed  with a sense of fun and adventure, with no fixed agenda. Asking students to contribute is a big part of the discussion. Several opinions and anecdotes are usually shared. One student might say how much his grandparents bought their home for 40 years ago; another may want to predict how much a movie ticket will cost in 60 years; another could have a candid story of what happened to a parent’s stock a few years ago. Allowing students to experience the power of exponential growth in this investment study is only a starting point to provide young minds with their first exposure to a dramatic type of nonlinear growth and a lively introduction to the world of economics and finance.",30,mtms2011-12-302a,,
