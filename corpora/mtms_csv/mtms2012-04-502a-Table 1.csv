Map Coloring:  A Student’s Perspective,1,mtms2012-04-502a,,
John Matthew Nicklas,2,mtms2012-04-502a,,
"Wouldn’t it be gratifying if students were motivated to do mathematics because of a specific problem? It would be especially gratifying if the problem led students to discover and use mathematical concepts on their own! As I was preparing to enter middle school, my teacher gave our class such a problem. We were asked to color a map of the twenty-two states west of the Mississippi River using four colors (see  fig. 1). Each state had to be a single color, and no two states with the same color could share a border (this border-color issue will be referred to as the border rule). Each state had a value (its rough area in thousands of square miles), and each color corresponded to a multiplier (red = 1, blue = 2, yellow =  3, and green = 4). Coloring a state multiplied by its value produced a cost. Adding the costs of all the states yielded a total cost (see fig. 2). The challenge was to color the map and  produce the lowest total cost. ",3,mtms2012-04-502a,,
"When our teacher introduced the map problem, he told us that it had many solutions, and he never told us which answer was best. Every student in our class worked on it for hours, and some of us never stopped. It was so engaging that months later some of my friends and I were still voluntarily working on it. Looking back, two traits of this problem were almost certainly the keys to our interest.",4,mtms2012-04-502a,,
1.  The problem had a seemingly   infinite number of possible  solutions.,5,mtms2012-04-502a,,
2.  We were uncertain about the   best solution.,6,mtms2012-04-502a,,

"We were also beginning to use mathematical properties, the names of which we would learn later in middle school. My interest in the map problem inspired me to explore a variety of concepts from the distributive property to the counting principle to graph-coloring theory. For me, the results from this problem went far beyond what I could have possibly imagined. ",8,mtms2012-04-502a,,
"My friends and I devised many  strategies for coloring the map, such as using the lowest-priced color on the largest state or coloring one edge of the map in the cheapest way possible. (See fi g. 3 for our strategy of starting along the top and coloring down.) As each state was colored, the border rule limited the coloring options. As work continued, the border rule required us to color a state a particular color or a series of states in a particular color arrangement.",9,mtms2012-04-502a,,
"There is no sure way to know if  anyone had the best possible solution. My friends and I raced each other to generate increasingly cheaper maps. To test solutions in shorter periods of time, we fi rst added the areas of all the states that were colored a certain color and then multiplied the sum by the color’s multiplier (see fi g. 2). Because there were fewer multiplication steps, the calculations were much quicker. I later learned that we had been applying the distributive property of multiplication over addition: a(b) + a(c) + a(d) = a(b + c + d) ",10,mtms2012-04-502a,,
"However, while working on the map problem, we just discovered the property as a way to test solutions faster.",11,mtms2012-04-502a,,
"I believe that determining the  precise number of possible solutions to the map problem required the application of graph coloring, a highlevel form of mathematics. I learned that graph-coloring theory began in the 1850s from work by a student of English mathematician Augustus de ",12,mtms2012-04-502a,,
Fig. 1 Each of the twenty-two states west of the Mississippi River was given a single color. No two states with the same color could share a border.,13,mtms2012-04-502a,,
"Fig. 2 A state’s area multiplied by its color number became its price, or cost.",14,mtms2012-04-502a,,
858 (total area of the red states)  582 (total area of the blue states)  586 (total area of the yellow states)  162 (total area of the green states)  ToTAL CoST  × 1 =    858 × 2 =  1164 × 3 =  1758 × 4 =    648 4428,15,mtms2012-04-502a,,
Fig. 3 one coloring strategy involved starting along the top and working down.,16,mtms2012-04-502a,,
"Morgan. This student used only four colors to highlight a map of the counties of England, with no two bordering counties sharing the same color. ",17,mtms2012-04-502a,,
"This student assumed that any map could be designed with no more than four colors. This four-color theorem was not proved until 1976, and then ",18,mtms2012-04-502a,,
"Fig. 4 Numbers that were assigned to states had to follow the border rule.  only with the help of a computer. Instead of using graph coloring   to calculate the exact number of solutions to the map problem, I used the counting principle to generate a rough estimate. At first, I counted the number of possible solutions for four colors for just two states that border each other (twelve possible color combinations), then for three states in a row with two sequential borders (thirty-six possible color combinations), and so on.",19,mtms2012-04-502a,,
"I learned that I had been using the counting principle, which states that the total number of possibilities is equal to the product of the number of possibilities for each part of the problem. However, even with the counting principle, estimating the number of solutions was difficult because states border multiple other states. As I tested specific sequences and multiplied the sets of possibilities, different totals resulted. I found that the number of possible colors for each state was limited not only by the number of each state’s borders but also by the coloring sequence (which state is colored first, second, and so on). (See fig. 4’s map with assigned possibili- ties.) I started in the top-left corner and assigned numbers as follows: •	 Washington:	Four	colors	are	  possible.",20,mtms2012-04-502a,,
"•	 Oregon:	Only	three	colors	are	  possible because it borders Washington, which is already colored.",21,mtms2012-04-502a,,
•	 Idaho:	Only	two	colors	can	be	used	 because it borders both Washington and	Oregon.	,22,mtms2012-04-502a,,
"Work continued through the rest of the map, finishing with Louisiana. The total number of possible solutions for a coloring sequence is the product of all the possible colors for each state (see fig. 5). The total number of solutions to the map problem may be far more than the 55,296 I calculated; in fact, there may be tens of thousands of solutions.",23,mtms2012-04-502a,,
"In summary, I am confident that a teacher can hold the interest of a middle school student with a problem that has a seemingly infinite number of possible solutions; teachers can use one in which students are uncertain about the best solution—similar to the map problem discussed here.",24,mtms2012-04-502a,,
Although it was initially frustrating ,25,mtms2012-04-502a,,
Fig. 5 This calculation reflected a  number of possibilities and assumed  no border between New Mexico and Utah or Arizona and Colorado at the Four Corners.,26,mtms2012-04-502a,,
"[WA, oR, ID, MT, ND]  then [Nv, CA, AZ, UT, WY] then [Co, ok, NM, TX, kS] then [NE, SD, Mo, IA, MN] then [AR, LA] = (4 × 3 × 2 × 3 × 3)          × (2 × 2 × 2 × 1 × 1)          × (2 × 2 × 1 × 2 × 2)          × (1 × 1 × 1 × 1 × 1)          × (1 × 2) = 55,296 ",27,mtms2012-04-502a,,
Note: The grouping of five states at a time is for readability only.,28,mtms2012-04-502a,,
"not to know the best solution among thousands, our teacher preserved the problem’s intrigue by not telling us the answer. Because this problem remained unsolved, and therefore challenging, it stimulated my friends and me to explore the world of mathematics. There are other variations to this problem, such as increasing the number of colors or using a different map. I believe that there are other equally stimulating problems as map coloring that students will voluntarily work on while wanting to learn more about mathematics.",29,mtms2012-04-502a,,
