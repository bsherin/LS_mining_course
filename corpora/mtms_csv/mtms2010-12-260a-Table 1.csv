"Helping Students Develop Capacity for Transfer tTeachers often report the frustration of  teaching new mathematical concepts to students who learn the concepts but are then unable to transfer that understanding to new situations. Perkins and Salomon (1988) describe a major educational goal shared among most teachers: to build students’ performance in a way that they can use their knowledge outside of school. Although the goal is clear and widely shared, accomplishing it can be challenging. Transfer is often portrayed as  static. Students are just supposed to know how to use learned ideas in new contexts. Research suggests that taking a developmental view of learning for transfer can be very helpful. In other words, discard the assumption that once students are taught a concept or skill they should be able to immediately apply it to a new situation. Instead, assume that mathematical ideas need to evolve and grow across time as students engage with their new knowledge in a variety of situations and mathematical contexts. Research also suggests that if particular habits of mind or ways of thinking are developed, such as seeking connections, they will support students in dealing with new situations.  “whether people can generate a finished product, the focus shifts to whether they are prepared to learn to solve new problems” (p. 69). Perkins and Salomon (1988) believe that transfer involves “abstracting from one context and  seeking connections with another context” (p. 26). They argue that transfer emerges from a deliberate focus on connection making. Together, these research findings offer insight into the types of instructional experiences that prepare students to transfer or use mathematical ideas meaningfully.",9,mtms2010-12-260a,,
"The design of a task can explicitly  position students to seek out and make connections. From an instructional unit on decimal operations, consider the task shown in figure 1. This unit was implemented following one on fraction operations. This task asked students to “reach back” (Perkins and Salomon 1988) and make connections between what they knew about fraction operations and what they were learning about decimal operations. For example, a student made a  connection between the use of place value when adding decimals and the use of common denominators when adding fractions. He said: ",10,mtms2010-12-260a,,

Asking students if 2n – 1 is more aligned with the reasoning used by student 1 or student 2 leads students to compare and contrast. Some students might conclude that 2n and n + n are equivalent. Others might conclude that if you simplify each algebraic generalization, they are each 2n – 1.

"tiPs FoR aiding the caPacitY to tRansFeR Instruction should provide intentionally planned experiences that require students to extend and deepen their mathematical knowledge. Perkins and Salomon (1988) suggest that too often activities that support the processes of abstracting, connection making, and transferring are rarely done persistently or systematically. NCTM (1989, 2000, 2006) points out the importance of building on students’ previous experiences and that students need to apply prior knowledge to increasingly more  complex situations. For students to learn to use (i.e., transfer) mathematical knowledge in meaningful ways, planned instructional opportunities are needed to support their capacity to transfer or make use of knowledge in novel contexts. How these tasks  are used is also important. See the sidebar for classroom tips and ideas. Being able to use math meaningfully is not just about how much mathematics you know. It involves how you use that information—how you connect mathematical ideas together, how you analyze new situations, what you notice, and how you use it to help with what you do not know. Mathematical ideas, mathematical thinking, and transfer of mathematical knowledge develop across time. Teachers should provide regular opportunities for students to reflect on why a procedure or approach that leads to an answer makes sense. Regular opportunities to make connections  across content and the use of previously learned ideas in more sophisticated settings will extend students’ mathematical thinking and their capacity to reason in novel settings.
