As with smart party planning, there are smart ways to connect math ideas so that students can hold on to them better. In this era of standards-based instruction, there can be a tendency to make standards into a checklist: As a standard is discussed, it is checked off. As teachers, we understand how these standards relate to one another, but do our students? For them, it might appear that they are trying to hold balloons without string. It is therefore important to help students connect essential mathematical ideas.  2010), provide one way to connect mathematical ideas.

8,"Gone Fishing: Science, Proportions, and Probability","The first objective is to match each pond name with the corresponding proportions that represent its fish population, given as ponds numbered 1 through 5. Five bags are distributed to each group of students. Each bag is labeled with the names of the five ponds and contains colored tiles in the same proportion as each of the stocked ponds. The activity sheet includes the stock of each pond numbered 1 through 5. The sampling procedures are simple. Each group samples 10 “fish” from each bag without replacement, records the numbers of each type of fish in the sample, and tags the fish in the sample by marking each tile before returning it to the bag. The reason for tagging the fish will become evident in the second activity. Tables 1 and 2 show original proportions and sample data, respectively.

19,"Gone Fishing: Science, Proportions, and Probability","specifically, ponds 1 and 5. For example, one of the first comments I usually hear is this: “We did not get any catfish from this pond, so it must be pond 5.” Sometimes students are forced to rethink this assumption as they sample other bags and get another sample without catfish. One group reasoned through such a problem in the following way: “We got two [bags] with no catfish, but there is only one pond without catfish. I guess that if we look at the other numbers for pond 5, it has a lot of trout. No other pond has that many trout. This one [pointing to a bag] has to be pond 5 and the other one is either pond 2 or 4 because they have a lot of bass.” Thus, the students were able to start looking beyond just one of the numbers (the zero) and to look for secondary information.",19,"Gone Fishing: Science, Proportions, and Probability"
20,"Gone Fishing: Science, Proportions, and Probability","After matching ponds 1 and 5,  the groups are forced to move on to  less obvious matches. Another common statement heard is this: “We have almost equal amounts of trout, catfish, and bass. Pond 3 has almost equal amounts [of each], so this must be pond 3.” By looking at all three numbers in a sample and their relative sizes, pond 3 can usually be distinguished from the other two. For some groups, this is the first opportunity that they have for thinking about ratios between the types of fish even if they do not use specific numbers. They are still deciding which ratios are “close” and which ones are not as close.",20,"Gone Fishing: Science, Proportions, and Probability"
21,"Gone Fishing: Science, Proportions, and Probability","At least one group will usually notice that it has the same proportions in its sample as in one of the ponds.

33,"Gone Fishing: Science, Proportions, and Probability","by pointing out that students were talking about the proportions being the same between the sample and the population in the bag. This observation has become complicated when sampling provided the same amounts of each fi sh from two different bags. When this happens, it encourages students to discuss other ways that they might tell the bags apart. It also makes them question whether it is possible to have two samples that are exactly the same if the populations in the bags are different.",33,"Gone Fishing: Science, Proportions, and Probability"
34,"Gone Fishing: Science, Proportions, and Probability","With the former issue, students  quickly discover that the samples are the only way to tell the bags apart; without additional information, they cannot do more than just guess between the two bags. The latter issue seems to stump them more. Although students generally accept the fact that they likely will not get the exact ratio in their sample as in the bag, they often struggle with the idea that two bags can yield the same sample. There seems to be a difference between theoretically understanding variation in sampling and accepting it in a real sample, thus emphasizing the need for activities such as this in which students analyze real data. ",34,"Gone Fishing: Science, Proportions, and Probability"
35,"Gone Fishing: Science, Proportions, and Probability","As has been shown, there can be a  wealth of mathematical ideas discussed  by simply matching pond names and numbers. Even more benefi t can come from displaying each group’s matches, spurring a discussion in which groups share their different strategies and concerns. This scenario leads to many signifi cant mathematical ideas about sampling variability, matching proportions, and how concerns would be dealt with in a real-life situation. ",35,"Gone Fishing: Science, Proportions, and Probability"
36,"Gone Fishing: Science, Proportions, and Probability","To encourage the discussion, questions such as the following can be posed: 1.  Why can we use a sample to determine the pond population? What assumption are we making? (We are assuming that random sampling is giving us a sample with about the same proportions as the population of ﬁ sh in the bag.) 2.  Do you think that each group has  the same fi sh in each bag? 3.  What were the easiest ones to  match? 4.  What reasoning did you use? 5.  Did you calculate anything? 6.  Why did we not all get the same  matches?  7.  Now that you see other groups’  matches, do you feel more or less confi dent about your matches?",36,"Gone Fishing: Science, Proportions, and Probability"
37,"Gone Fishing: Science, Proportions, and Probability","For this activity, proportional reasoning is often used even if students  do not make calculations. By understanding that the sample proportion should be similar to the proportion in the bag, students are applying proportional reasoning. Additionally, ideas about sampling probabilities are inevitably part of the discussion. For example: Is it possible to catch a bass if there are no bass in the pond? Is it possible to get more catfi sh than trout in a sample if there are more trout than catfi sh in the pond? The fi rst question obviously addresses a more basic understanding of the probability continuum, whereas the second question helps differentiate among possible, probable, and even degrees of probable. Generally all groups agree that they are more confi dent about some matches than others. “[Ponds] 2 and 4 are harder because the proportions are similar [to each other]” was an observation that one student made, and the majority of groups agreed with this assessment. ",37,"Gone Fishing: Science, Proportions, and Probability"
38,"Gone Fishing: Science, Proportions, and Probability","By sharing data as a class and  discussing not only strategies but also why some ponds were harder to match than others, the students were led to look for similarities in ponds 2 and 4 or at least what made them different from the rest of the ponds. This helps students understand how different proportions can affect their ability to make  decisions based on statistical data. Additionally, they conclude that they are more confident about their matches for ponds 2 and 4 (if they agree with the majority) after they have seen matches for other groups. Invariably, one student will informally explain the Law of Large Numbers to the class, thus connecting this statistical idea as well.",38,"Gone Fishing: Science, Proportions, and Probability"
39,"Gone Fishing: Science, Proportions, and Probability","Both proportions and sampling  probability are important to this activity and will naturally be a part of any discussion. The role of the teacher is to facilitate this discussion using questions similar to those listed here. Because of the natural connections to a real context and hands-on experience with the probabilities and proportions, my experience is that students do not need significant prompting to talk about the mathematics involved in the activity. More often, they need help putting their strategies into mathematical language and turning intuition into viable arguments. Both of these skills are emphasized in the Common Core’s Standards for Mathematical Practice (SMP), specifically, SMP 6 and SMP 3, respectively. Both practices can be acknowledged throughout the discussion as students are encouraged to explain their thinking and are directed toward precise language.",39,"Gone Fishing: Science, Proportions, and Probability"

58,"Gone Fishing: Science, Proportions, and Probability","The student work in figure 1a is more formal and more common for students who have been taught traditional procedures when working with proportions. Students who have less experience with proportions or have more flexible ways of thinking about proportions often use strategies that are similar to the second or third examples. Picking students or groups with unique or informal strategies in advance is important because if the first strategy above is the first one shared, many students with more informal strategies are too intimidated to share their strategy afterward.

59,"Gone Fishing: Science, Proportions, and Probability","According to Ellis (2013, p. 8), “Students will need additional practice with a variety of different problems before they are able to develop more sophisticated iterating and partitioning strategies,” which emphasizes the need for a multitude of strategies to be shared and seen by students.

",59,"Gone Fishing: Science, Proportions, and Probability"
60,"Gone Fishing: Science, Proportions, and Probability","The latter two examples also show  two very mathematically different ways of thinking about the problem. Figure 1b references a part-to-whole ratio of tagged fish to the sample total, whereas figure 1c uses a part-to-part ratio of tagged to untagged fish within the sample. These three examples do not represent all possible strategies but rather a variety of options that students can use to solve this problem.",60,"Gone Fishing: Science, Proportions, and Probability"

I begin by asking all students to look at the estimates from all the groups and tell me what they notice. This is purposely open-ended because I want to see what patterns or organization they can observe when it is not obvious. Frequently, this activity will produce estimates between 11 and 100, with a significant variance for individual ponds. Initial comments include that “they are definitely estimates” and “we have some outliers.” This last comment was made by an advanced student. When these students were pressed to explain their comments, the second student stated, “All of us had random samples that are different, so obviously we are not going to come up with the same number.” Despite the correct terminology that this student was able to use, she had trouble looking past the differences in the ",61,"Gone Fishing: Science, Proportions, and Probability"

63,"Gone Fishing: Science, Proportions, and Probability","numbers to see general trends. Her thinking, shared by other students, was misaligning random samples with random outcomes. This misconception can be addressed through the remainder of the discussion about the results. The following questions can guide that discussion:  1.  What reasoning led to your   estimates? 2.  Can we definitely determine which  pond has the best conditions? 3.  There are 10 tagged fish in a   bag of 20 fish. a.  How many tagged fish would  you expect in your sample?   b.  How many tagged fish are   possible in your sample?  c.  Which values of tagged fish   are likely? 4.

64,"Gone Fishing: Science, Proportions, and Probability","Questions 3 and 4 offer an opportunity to talk about strategy with common numbers, which is important because each group is not working with the same sample data. These two questions also address differences in  sampling, which should be a significant issue in the discussions because it is usually obvious to students who are comparing estimates that there is significant variation. In one implementation of these activities, one group selected none of their previously tagged fish in the second activity. According to their strategy, they concluded that their population estimate could be any number between 20 and infinity.
