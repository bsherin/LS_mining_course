"I teach a content course in problem solving for middle school teachers. During the course, teacher candidates have the opportunity to confront their insecurities as they actively engage in solving math problems using a variety of strategies. As the semester progresses, they add new strategies to their problem-solving arsenal and explicitly reflect on teaching and learning practices that are conducive to this process.  for a break.

The decision to require this course was driven by the vision of problem solving articulated by NCTM (1980, 1989, 2000), our knowledge of middle school curricula, assessments of teacher candidates, and An Agenda for Action (NCTM 1980). Those publications contained the vision for pre-K−12 mathematics teaching and learning, which also provided direction for states and school districts in developing curriculum guidelines.  l e a r n i n g  I m p o r t a n t",7,mtms2010-09-104a(1),,

The important thing about teaching problem solving is that you don’t give answers. You can teach strategies to solve problems or you can focus their attention. You can even let the students work together and you can provide them with manipulatives. But the most important thing about teaching problem solving is that you don’t GIVE the answers.,10,mtms2010-09-104a(1),,

"Central to these documents was the  recommendation that the pre-K−12 mathematics curriculum should be organized around problem solving and that teachers should create classroom environments where problem solving could flourish. The recommendations brought the promise of change in math programs across the curriculum; the realization of this vision, however, is yet to be achieved. Almost three decades later, teacher candidates entering my problem-solving course continue to lament that problem solving did not play a crucial role in their own K−12 mathematics experiences. ",18,mtms2010-09-104a(1),,
"In the problem-solving autobiographies they complete in the first week of the semester, students expressed their insecurities about the dreaded word prob lems and their own problem-solving skills. Although I continue to hope that the vision articulated by NCTM will become a reality, students continue to exit their K−12 schooling with an underlying fear of math problems, especially if they are posed with “words.” ",19,mtms2010-09-104a(1),,
"However, after students have  completed this course and I have read their reflections and metacognitive journals and heard their class comments, I feel assured that they are beginning to think differently about the problem-solving process. They are now armed with information that they can take into future classrooms (Roberts and Tayeh 2006/2007). These teacher-candidate comments reassure me that the semester was a success:  how to cement what we had studied to increase the likelihood that the lessons learned would be available to students in the future.

"Closure, a critical juncture in  the learning process, is where the teacher can assess what students have learned. It is also a time for students to tie up loose ends and solidify their learning experiences (Silbey 2001). Closure melds what students have learned and helps them organize the information into a meaningful context. While moving through required curricula, closure is too often lost in the rush to get to the next assignment or topic. ",21,mtms2010-09-104a(1),,
"Closure can occur at the end of a lesson, unit, or course and can be delivered in a variety of formats and venues. The common denominator is that it serves both the teacher and the student. My hope is that these individuals will leave my classroom better equipped with new tools. The dilemma I face is not unique to my college classroom. ",22,mtms2010-09-104a(1),,

"This experience with teacher  candidates can easily be adapted for a variety of audiences and a range of concepts to help teachers assess students’ thinking and to help students bring closure to their learning. The Important Book can set the stage and provide a structure that is easy to follow.
