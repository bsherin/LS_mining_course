She is interested in the mathematics components of preparation programs for teachers and in learning and teaching problem solving using multiple perspectives.  w group. Finally, the blindfolds were  removed, and the five looked at the animal that each had described. Each person realized that not only was his or her perspective valid, albeit in a limited way, but also that this applied equally to every member of the group. Only after opening their eyes (literally and metaphorically) and seeing the animal from a variety of angles could they appreciate the complete picture. ",4,mtms2008-04-438a,,
"What purpose is served by studying multiple representations of a mathematical idea? Let me begin by recounting a story. Once upon a time, five people who had never seen an elephant were blindfolded and led to an elephant and asked to describe what they thought the creature looked like. The people were allowed to touch the animal. They approached it from different directions. One felt the tail, the second found its leg, the third reached for the trunk, another felt its ear, and the fifth person touched the great stomach of the animal. Each one then described his or her version of the animal and each was, in turn, completely surprised at the contrasting view offered by the others in the ",5,mtms2008-04-438a,,
This story epitomizes the use of  multiple representations in understanding a mathematical concept. A mathematical representation often highlights only one aspect of a mathematical concept. To restrict oneself to any one mathematical representation is to approach the concept blindfolded. A holistic picture of the concept begins to emerge only when one removes the blindfold and looks at the idea from different perspectives.,6,mtms2008-04-438a,,
"What is a representation in the  context of mathematics learning? Essentially, one can describe a mathematical representation as a mental or physical construct that describes aspects of the inherent structure  of a concept and the interrelationships between the concept and other ideas. A representation would include concrete, verbal, numerical, graphical, contextual, pictorial, or symbolic components that depict aspects of the concept. In other words, we may think of a representation as a form of an idea that allows us to interpret, communicate, and discuss the idea with others. How would you discuss the concept of a line with your students? You could describe it in words as a collection of points placed side by side, extending indefinitely in both directions (a verbal representation); draw a line on a board (a graphical or pictorial representation, depending on the details that you put in); have your students stand side by side to model it (a concrete representation); or write an equation (an algebraic representation). Each representation communicates some aspects of a line while ignoring other aspects.",7,mtms2008-04-438a,,
"The use of multiple representations in learning and teaching mathematics has long been an issue of considerable interest to mathematics educators. As  in which I can introduce them to the variety of forms in which this concept can be perceived?” Research studies have sought to answer these questions in terms of multiple representations. The two questions that I will address in this article are the following:  1.  From the vast body of research  on multiple representations, what is relevant to the middle school classroom? 2.  How can the ideas suggested by this  research be used in the classroom? ",8,mtms2008-04-438a,,
"Lesh, Post, and Behr (1987) suggested a classification of mathematical representations as concrete (manipulatives), language, symbolism (notation), semiconcrete (pictorial), and contextual (real-world situations). This classification scheme helps to differentiate the many forms of mathematical concepts. It also gives some indication of the abilities that are specific to each form so that we may help our learners develop the necessary abilities while understanding the concept. ",9,mtms2008-04-438a,,
"To understand this classification and how it may help us think about the learning abilities corresponding to each category, consider this example. A teacher, while discussing a circle with her class, may have her students use plastic shapes to show the concept concretely. This action brings into play the learners’ primary sensorial and tactile abilities. Students may be encouraged to use language such as “a circle does not have any straight edges,” thus developing the ability to articulate coherent thought processes. As students learn to denote the shape symbolically as  or as circle C (where C is the center of the circle), they are moving toward abstraction and the ability to refer to an object through a form that may not share a physical resemblance with the object. Students may draw a circle in their notebooks as a pictorial representation. They may  more and more classroom-based research studies have provided convincing evidence of the benefits of the use of multiple representations, the focus has shifted from whether to use different representations to how multiple representations may be used in teaching and learning specific concepts and how they can foster mathematical learning.",10,mtms2008-04-438a,,
WhY shoUld We Use MUltiPle RePResentations?,11,mtms2008-04-438a,,
"By and large, mathematics is composed of concepts that are interconnected through a variety of relationships. Learning a concept usually entails not just knowing the meaning of the concept but also understanding the multiple relationships that connect the concept to other ideas. The larger picture results in a fairly complex and intricate structure, which is what a learner strives to understand. Different mathematical representations of the idea highlight various aspects of this structure. Using these different representations is like examining the concept through a variety of lenses, with each lens providing a different  perspective that makes the picture (concept) richer and deeper. As the number of perspectives increases, we develop better insight into the concept. Thus, employing multiple representations of a concept to teach and learn mathematics seems appropriate to the nature of the discipline.",12,mtms2008-04-438a,,
"Research studies based in and  outside classrooms have provided us with much food for thought in regard to using multiple representations in our classroom. The community of mathematics teachers has already reflected on this issue to an extent. It is, as Shulman and Quinlan (1996) note, a part of our pedagogical content knowledge—the capacity to transform the content knowledge that each of us possesses into forms that are pedagogically powerful and yet adaptive to variations in students’ abilities and backgrounds. As teachers, we are constantly thinking about representations when we ask ourselves, “In what forms would I like my students to see this concept? Are those contexts accessible to my students in terms of their cognitive level? What are the ways ",13,mtms2008-04-438a,,

"Since the classification above came  into use, the repertoire of representations accessible to the learner has greatly expanded, in part because of the easy availability of such technology as graphing calculators and mathematical software. In particular, the scope of semiconcrete, or pictorial, representations has expanded to such a large extent that it would be more appropriate to reclassify the semiconcrete-pictorial as visual representations. Visual representations would include such forms as organized diagrams or tables, concrete models, graphs, metaphors, dynamic or moving imagery, and word pictures (the description in sentences of what we are trying to accomplish).

"Visual forms of representation have  been perhaps the most researched topic among different representations in recent years, in part because they are more readily available but also because researchers have found that they play an important role in determining and nurturing problem-solving ability. As Arcavi (2003) states, “Visualization is being recognized as a key component of reasoning, problem solving and even proving” (p. 21). The enhanced role of visual representations in mathematics learning makes it worth our while as teachers to focus on it. In another attempt to explore the connections between problem solving and visual abilities, Stylianou and Silver (2004) contrasted expert mathematicians with undergraduate students in an analysis of the potential and actual use of visual representations in mathematical problem solving. They found that although both groups perceived visual representations as viable strategies, the experts applied such strategies to a wider variety of problems (that included nongeometric examples). Further, the experts used the visual representations more frequently and dynamically to study and understand the problem and plan a solution during the problemsolving activity. Such studies indicate that the ability to develop and use visual representational forms is valuable enough that it should become an integral part of mathematical learning. ",27,mtms2008-04-438a,,
"Another important factor to bear  in mind is that as learners progress through middle school, they are moving from the perceptuo-motor level to more abstract levels of thinking—from the concrete operational to the formal operational stage (in terms of Piaget’s developmental stages). Thus, middle  school is an appropriate time to initiate students into visual forms of representing mathematical ideas and the notion that a pictorial representation can represent objects and relationships between the objects. Such representations serve as a bridge between concrete objects that students may use to model concepts at earlier stages of understanding a concept and the symbolic or verbal forms that they may use later to refer to the concept. As Principles and Standards for School Mathematics states, “An understanding of the meanings and uses of variables develops gradually as students create and use symbolic expressions and relate them to verbal, tabular, and graphical representations” (NCTM 2000, p. 225). ",28,mtms2008-04-438a,,
"What are some roles that visualization strategies play in developing mathematical thinking? Ajose (1999) describes the following three roles: (a) they can support and illustrate results that are essentially symbolic (for example, Venn diagrams are used to illustrate the union or intersection of sets); (b) they offer a possible way of resolving conflict between correct (possibly symbolic) solutions and incorrect intuitions (for example, using the vertical line test often helps students see why a relation such as x = y2 that seems very similar to y = x2 is not a function); and (c) they are a way to help us engage and recover conceptual underpinnings that may be easily bypassed by more formal solutions (for example, compare the algebraic solution in the Taking Stock problem with the visual solutions). These roles suggest ways in which we might encourage our students to use visual forms of representation. ",29,mtms2008-04-438a,,
"Although research studies suggest  that there is much to be gained by consciously nurturing students’ abilities to use visual representations, a teacher may encounter some difficulties. Arcavi (2003) classified these difficulties as cultural (“visual is not mathematical”), cognitive (“visual is more difficult”),  and social (“teaching visually is more difficult”). The good news is that in the last few years within the mathematics community, changes have led to a gradual shift in attitudes and the realization of the importance of visual imagery. One may say that the cultural barriers are gradually receding. How-",30,mtms2008-04-438a,,
"The ability to use specific ways of reasoning can be developed ever, to overcome cognitive and social difficulties in the classroom, much effort is needed from the community of mathematics teachers. In turn, teachers need to be supported so that they can help their students realize that although visual representations may appear to be difficult at first (they do not always lead to a step-by-step algorithmic solution), over time, one can develop the ability to use visual representations and derive much insight from them.

"We had attempted similar problems in which students would use tables of values of linear data to check for linearity. The difference in this question came from the fact that the tables in earlier problems had always had three or more coordinate points so that students could confirm the constant slope for the data through numerical calculations. In this case, the constant-slope aspect of the situation had been expressed verbally, and there were only two data points given to the students. It took some time and discussion for consensus to emerge among the students on the similarity of this situation to earlier situations and that “saving the same amount each week is the same as having the same slope [at different points of our observation].” At the end of the problem, I believe that students had a better understanding of slope and the linear model through these struggles with the varied representations. For me, the time spent on this problem in class (and it did take some time) was useful, and the negotiation between the different representations led to a better understanding of the concept of lines. I would also like to emphasize that it was important for me and my  students to construct different kinds of connections as we moved along in class.
