Background,3,mtms2007-04-442a,,
"When using the Pythagorean theorem, students find hypotenuse lengths that are not integers. if a student draws a right triangle with legs that have lengths 2 and 3 units, what would he or she expect the length of the hypotenuse to be? For many students,  313 is a difficult number to comprehend. it is hoped that students could guess that it must be larger than 19 and smaller than 316, so it must be between 3 and 4 units long. experiments with squaring different decimal values do not result in the value of 13. For example, see the list below.",4,mtms2007-04-442a,,
  3.62 = 12.96   3.72 = 13.69  3.612 = 13.0321 3.602 = 12.96 3.6052 = 12.996025 3.6062 = 13.003236,5,mtms2007-04-442a,,

"to find representations for more irrational lengths, students can now use the calculations and drawing that they have just completed. using that  12 hypotenuse as one leg, they can draw another right triangle with legs 1 and 12. then, using the Pythagorean theorem, each student can calculate that this new hypotenuse must be 13 inches long. it is interesting to note that the picture of 13 is so much easier to create than the decimal approximation of 13 inches.  continuing  in  this  manner  and  building  on  the images  as  shown  in  figures  3a–c,  we  can  create a  graceful  spiraling  image  known  as  the  wheel  of   13 12 (a) 4   =   2 13 12 (b) 17 16 16 15 17 4   =   2 13 12 (c)",17,mtms2007-04-442a,,

"Theodorus (see fig. 4). (theodorus, a greek mathematician  of  the  fifth  century  Bc,  was  a  Pythagorean, a member of a group of devoted followers of Pythagoras,  and  one  of  Plato’s  teachers.  Little  is known about theodorus; however, Plato gave him credit for proving that the square roots of 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 17 are irrational. many  people have attempted to determine the technique he used. one popular conjecture involves a spiral, called the wheel of theodorus, which is composed of  contiguous  right  triangles  with  hypotenuse lengths equal to the square roots of 2, 3, and 4, up to the square root of 17.)  asking students to create this spiral by carefully constructing a series of right triangles with one leg remaining 1 unit long and the other leg being the previous hypotenuse is an engaging class exercise. at this point, the classwork ends. the project now becomes an out-of-class task.  students are given the assignment sheet and the grading  rubric  shown  in  the  appendix.  in  class, i tell students that their grade will be determined by meeting the criteria of the rubric. students are required to submit a colorful, labeled drawing with an attached sheet showing their work for the first eight  triangles.  they  are  free  to  create  their  images with as much or as little detail or artistry as they choose.",20,mtms2007-04-442a,,
"through the years, i have seen projects that are simple but colorful, mathematically correct and incorrect, and delightfully intricate. i have received drawings of sea shells, crustaceans, hair styles, and lollipops (see the artwork featured throughout the article).  asking students to label calculated side lengths brings  to  the  forefront  their  understanding  of  the Pythagorean theorem. they also show their knowledge that some square roots are rational (14 = 2), and some are not. they discover that irrational numbers are not very difficult to write in radical form or to express in visual form.",21,mtms2007-04-442a,,
