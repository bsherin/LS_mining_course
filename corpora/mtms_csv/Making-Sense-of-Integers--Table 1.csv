0,Making Sense of Integers through Storytelling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Consider this open number sentence: 5 +  = 21. What kind of story would you pose for that sentence? What kind of context would you use, and why would you use it? How do you think your students would respond? We asked fifth-grade and eighth-grade students to pose stories for number sentences involving the addition and subtraction of integers, like the number sentence 5 +  = 21 just considered. Take a look at these eight stories from our students (see fig. 1). Which of these stories do you think works for the given number sentence? What do they reveal about student thinking?",,

2,Making Sense of Integers through Storytelling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"When we examined these stories, we noticed that the students work reflected different ways of thinking about integers. We call these mathematical uses of integers conceptual models. We describe five models that emerged from our research: bookkeeping, counterbalance, relativity, translation, and rule.",,

4,Making Sense of Integers through Storytelling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Bookkeeping,,
5,Making Sense of Integers through Storytelling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The bookkeeping model involves using integers to describe gains and losses. The use of zero in this model represents a status of neither loss nor gain.  The bookkeeping model can represent a gain and loss of any item and is not necessarily limited to the context of money. For example, gains and losses can be conceptualized through such scenarios as owing and acquiring candy bars or wanting and receiving baseball cards. Isaac, Patrice, and Wesley used the bookkeeping conceptual model in their stories (see fig. 1). Instead of pursuing a context involving money, Isaac and Wesley owed homework assignments and wanted baseball cards to represent losses, or negative integers, and completing homework assignments and getting baseball cards as gains, or positive integers. This bookkeeping model of thinking was most prevalent among our students. It seems that conceptualizing negative integers as losses and viewing positive integers as gains were intuitive for them.",,
6,Making Sense of Integers through Storytelling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Counterbalance,,
7,Making Sense of Integers through Storytelling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"A conceptual model of counterbalance involves using positive and negative integers to balance, or cancel, each other out. This model is similar to the Balanced Metric, cancellation, and chip modeling concepts found in the literature (e.g., Battista 1983). The zero in this counterbalance model indicates neutralization. The distinguishing element of this model is that the quantities always remain, even when neutralized. For example, consider three electrons (3) and three protons (+3) that provide an electrical charge of 0, with 3 + 3 = 0. The electrons, with a charge of 3, and the protons, with a charge of +3, still exist despite the neutralization. The existence of quantities that remain, although neutralized, differentiates this way of thinking from the bookkeeping model. Kim used this counterbalance model to describe good deeds and bad deeds in her story. The good and the bad neutralize each other, but the quantities still remain. This model was one of the least used ways of thinking by our students, even after instruction on integers. It appears that ideas of neutralization were not as intuitive  for students as with the concept of bookkeeping.",,
8,Making Sense of Integers through Storytelling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Relativity,,
9,Making Sense of Integers through Storytelling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"A conceptual model of relativity involves using integers in relative positions and as a comparison to a referent. With relativity, the zero is not actually zero but treated as a referent, or point of reference, for comparison. In Mollys story, the actual score of the game is unknown, and the negative integers are used in a way relative to a tied game. For instance, Molly used 5 to represent being down  5 runs from the winning score. The actual score could have been 25 to 20, 7 to 2, or any score in which a particular team is down by 5 runs. Of all the conceptual models, this way of thinking was used the least by our students. The relativity conceptual model may be more abstract and therefore more difficult to conceptualize than other ways of thinking because the referent is unknown.",,
10,Making Sense of Integers through Storytelling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Translation,,
11,Making Sense of Integers through Storytelling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"A conceptual model of translation may be used if integers are treated as vectors, or directed numbers. With this model, integers are used to shift any kind of mathematical object. The zero may represent a zero vector, or no movement. Similar to relativity, the zero can also represent a relative position, with positive and negative numbers representing a movement in one direction or another from the relative zero. Miguel used the translation conceptual model in his story about traveling. For Miguel, the starting position was his house. In his story, the miles traveled in the direction toward a destination were positive, and the miles traveled in the opposite direction were negative. The translation model was used more often than counterbalance and relativity by students but less than bookkeeping. This model can easily tie into contexts about motion and is related to the number line, a pedagogical tool often used in integer explorations.",,
12,Making Sense of Integers through Storytelling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Rule,,
13,Making Sense of Integers through Storytelling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"A conceptual model of rule occurs when integers are used in a way that is contingent to some outside rule or algorithm. This model may be constructed outside the context of the problem or task. For example, several students applied an algorithm for subtracting a negative number called keep-change-change, writing a story that involved addition instead of subtraction. Other students created their own rules that were not necessarily true, such as reasoning that negative integers could always be treated as if they were positive integers. Hailey, for example, had no problem starting with negative two baseballs and subtracting three more baseballs from the quantity, even though such a story did not make sense contextually. Our students used the conceptual model of rule nearly as much as bookkeeping. Whether the rules they created were correct or incorrect, students used this model frequently. Although its use was prevalent, it often failed for the users, thus pointing to the importance of aiming for a conceptual understanding of integers. Students may prefer reasoning with rules, perhaps because of a strong instructional focus in school on such integer operations.",,
14,Making Sense of Integers through Storytelling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Teaching Tips,,
15,Making Sense of Integers through Storytelling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,The following tips suggest ways that we can incorporate this research into practice for the teaching and learning of integers and integer operations.,,
16,Making Sense of Integers through Storytelling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"1. Incorporate storytelling as a tool to access student thinking about integers. The stories that students wrote for open number sentences provided opportunities to ascertain how they were making sense of integers and highlighted their different ways of thinking. Some students stories worked well for integers and other stories did not because contexts need to support opposites. For example, Haileys story with negative softballs did not support opposites. In contrast, Wesleys story incorporated opposites when he wanted and got baseball cards. Although it was not a typical context, the opposites chosen helped make the story work well within the integer number sentence. This idea that integers should be used with contexts that incorporate opposites is a helpful connection that can begin with students posing stories before formal integer instruction occurs and can reveal students ways of thinking.",,
17,Making Sense of Integers through Storytelling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"2. Use a variety of contexts to  promote different ways of thinking  about the integers. Contexts are a pedagogical tool that we often use to promote learning about negative integers. Hidden behind these contexts are more comprehensive mathematical uses of integers that are important in teaching and learning because the contexts may promote different ways of thinking. For example, the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSI 2010) suggested the use of a variety of contexts, including temperature, elevation, credit and debits, or electron charges when teaching integers. However, if only one of these contexts is used, then certain mathematical ideas may be missed. For instance, the contexts of temperature and elevation can promote ideas of translation and relativity but do not promote ideas of counterbalance. In contrast, contexts such as electron charges promote mathematical ideas such as counterbalance.",,
18,Making Sense of Integers through Storytelling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Our students used the conceptual models of bookkeeping and rule most frequently. The counterbalance and relativity conceptual models were used by our students the least, even after formal instruction in their schools. We think that the infrequent use of the counterbalance and relativity conceptual models could partly be due to the lack of contextual support for this way of thinking. For example, within the contexts advocated by the Common Core, particle charge is the only context that supports counterbalance reasoning, which is an unlikely contextual choice for students. Letting students make up stories may allow for more counterbalance contexts to emerge. Some students used a counterbalance context when exploring good and bad deeds. Students often used more than one way of thinking, making use of multiple conceptual models. Other students only used one conceptual model for their stories. Students need more experience with multiple ways of thinking about integers. These broader ways of thinking may help students think about integers in different ways that go beyond just bookkeeping or creating rules for integers.",,
19,Making Sense of Integers through Storytelling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Putting it into Practice,,
20,Making Sense of Integers through Storytelling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Consider beginning your integer lessons with a storytelling activity, even before discussions about operating with integers. Share these stories in class and discuss the different uses of the integers. Have students write stories individually and then talk about their stories in groups. Students can reflect on which stories they think fit and which stories do not fit the number sentences.",,
21,Making Sense of Integers through Storytelling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"After sharing stories together and discussing them as a class, analyze which conceptual models are used the least by students. Consider highlighting a story provided by a student that explores one of the lesser-used conceptual models in your class  (see fig. 2). This discussion may help build flexible reasoning by giving other students a different way of thinking. Be mindful of not treating the conceptual models as a checklist or as names of models that students must memorize. Rather, view these models as tools to help you understand the ways that your students are thinking, to help you guide discussions, or to help you design lessons.",,
22,Making Sense of Integers through Storytelling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
23,Making Sense of Integers through Storytelling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Learning our students ways of thinking about integers is imperative if we want to create learners who are flexible in their understandings of integers.,,
24,Making Sense of Integers through Storytelling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,LOOKING PAST COMPUTATION,,
25,Making Sense of Integers through Storytelling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"As educators, we have limited physical models to illustrate integers (e.g., chips and number lines). Understanding the conceptual models that your students use can give you another tool to help students learn about integers. Integer operations are often learned computationally or procedurally; however, a robust discussion on the uses and ways of reasoning about the integers can promote sense making in integer arithmetic.",,
26,Making Sense of Integers through Storytelling - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Different problem types may make more sense with different conceptual models. For example, 2  3 may make more sense for students who are using counterbalance or translation conceptual models rather than the rule or bookkeeping models. It is important for students to experience and learn about these different ways of thinking to incorporate conceptual thinking and use of integers. Thinking about the integers at a conceptual level is important because students need to understand integers at a deeper level than simply operating  on them. This will help students  connect integers to their world and be able to use these ideas with advanced mathematics.",,
