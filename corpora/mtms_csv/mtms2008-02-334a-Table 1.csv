"iIn 1953, I was recruited for my high  school’s math team. That event changed my life. No longer simply repeating techniques shown previously, I was taught to focus intensively on problem solving. As a result, I majored in mathematics in college. For much of my teaching career, I coached math teams and was often amazed at the number of well-known mathematics teachers I met whose backgrounds were similar to mine. My teaching career, like many of theirs, was built on using rich, engaging problems to teach content. One key to this approach is to allow students to create their own ways to solve the problems, which helps them actively own the concepts they use. I acted as a moderator, encouraging different individuals to explain aloud different solutions to each problem, adding my comments only as needed. Material was automatically reviewed intensively by eliciting several concepts for every problem. In addition, many students participated voluntarily and often made surprising connections. See “The Value of Multiple Solutions” (Kalman 2004) for an amplification of this point.",4,mtms2008-02-334a,,
"the students was to explore algebra 1 problems nonalgebraically. The hope was that by helping students visualize the problems conversationally, they might be better prepared to understand the algebraic techniques required. ",5,mtms2008-02-334a,,
"Algebra is, among other things, a shorthand way to express quantitative reasoning. To me, elementary algebra actually is common sense written in symbols. For a student, its concise language can obscure the actual thinking that occurs when solving a problem. A series of equations that forms a solution tells us how to proceed but is silent about why we perform these particular steps. A clear conversational approach that examines the rationale behind each step can set a good foundation for the technical work to follow.",6,mtms2008-02-334a,,
"In 1994, I retired from teaching  to join the Mathematical Olympiads for Elementary and Middle Schools (MOEMS, or Math Olympiads) but continued to work frequently with both students and teachers. Since 1979, the Math Olympiads has made a point of eliciting nonalgebraic solutions to algebra 1 problems from students in grades 4–6 (Lenchner 1997; MOEMS 1995–2005). As educators, one of our most compelling obligations is to build a strong foundation for future studies. In keeping with that obligation, this article will illustrate ways for the classroom teacher to convert algebraic solutions to verbal problems into conversational solutions that can be understood by students in the lower grades. Three reasonably typical verbal problems that either appeared as or resemble Math Olympiad tasks are presented here.  nicKels and QUaRteRs",7,mtms2008-02-334a,,
"Mrs. Bailey has the same number of nickels as quarters. The value of the quarters is $1.80 more than the value of the nickels. What is the total value of her nickels and quarters? (Lenchner 1997, p. 70)",8,mtms2008-02-334a,,
"Algebraic solution: Suppose she has  n nickels. Then she has n quarters. Their values are 5n cents and 25n cents, respectively. Expressing the second sentence of the problem in cents produces equation (1): (1)  25n = 5n + 180",9,mtms2008-02-334a,,
"Subtracting 5n from each side, we get (2)  20n = 180.",10,mtms2008-02-334a,,
"Dividing both sides by 20, we get  (3)  n = 9.",11,mtms2008-02-334a,,
"Therefore, the total value is  25n + 5n = 25(9) + 5(9)  (4)                               = 225 + 45 = 270.",12,mtms2008-02-334a,,
Mrs. Bailey has a total value of $2.70.,13,mtms2008-02-334a,,
How can we help students employ the algebraic thinking explained above before they have learned algebraic techniques? We need to translate each step above into conversational terms to plant the seeds of appropriate procedural understanding in their minds. I believe it is valuable for students in the earlier grades to experience the pathways of thought that they will need subsequently.  teaching algebra without algebra,14,mtms2008-02-334a,,
Richard S. Kalman,15,mtms2008-02-334a,,
"This same conversational approach also teaches students to solve problems, a major goal of mathematics education according to Principles and Standards for School Mathematics (NCTM 2000) and many educators. Learning to think mathematically now will help them form a stronger foundation for high school mathematics and college entrance tests later (Bay-Williams 2004).",16,mtms2008-02-334a,,
"Verbal (nonalgebraic) solution: First, let us examine the actions behind each equation. The first two sentences of the problem state that the two types of coins are equal in quantity and that they differ by $1.80. Equation (1) is a combination of those facts. Equation (2) is the result of subtracting the 5n from 25n to leave 20n. Equation (3) is the result of dividing by 20. In equation (4), we merely use the solution to equation (1) to generate the requested value.",17,mtms2008-02-334a,,
"To parallel the algebraic steps from above, we want to translate each step from algebra to verbal descriptions. Since the numbers of quarters and nickels are the same, we can pair them. In each pair, the value of the quarter is 20 cents more than the value of the nickel. Consider all pairs: The given $1.80 is the product of the number of pairs and 20 cents. Thus, Mrs. Bailey has 9 pairs. The value of the nine quarters is $2.25, the value of the nine nickels is $0.45, and the total value of her quarters and nickels is $2.70. Checking, the difference between $2.25 and $0.45 is $1.80.",18,mtms2008-02-334a,,
Some additional comments can be  helpful to the teacher.,19,mtms2008-02-334a,,
"•  Sometimes students’ short answers  make little sense. For example, if asked for, say, a number of buses, they may reply, “3 1/2.” Routinely requiring an answer to be a full sentence forces students to consider the context. In this case, they are unlikely to respond, “There are 3 1/2 buses.” •  Sometimes students answer questions they like instead of the ones you ask. Training them to answer using the wording given in the question encourages them to check for appropriateness.",20,mtms2008-02-334a,,
"•  Some students may notice that considering a single pair of coins allows us to use the distributive law twice. The first instance occurs when $1.80 is divided by the difference in values, which is 20 cents. The second can occur if we choose to multiply the number of pairs, 9, by the value of 1 pair, 30 cents, instead of translating equation (4). Such students are using mathematical thinking instead of just performing mechanical operations and should be encouraged to explain it to everyone.  •  Traditionally, students are asked only to find the value of the variable. This could lead a teacher to suggest erroneously that the variable should always represent the quantity to be found. A nice feature of problem 1 is that the variable and the answer are two different quantities, which forces the student to analyze the problem carefully before assigning a meaning to their variable.",21,mtms2008-02-334a,,
"•  Once students solve for a vari- able, they may stop automatically. Requesting an answer that is an outgrowth of the variable can help train students to keep working and perhaps to look back at the question before answering.",22,mtms2008-02-334a,,
"•  A great feature of coin problems is that they ask students to supply values not stated explicitly. In this  case, students had to furnish the values of both coins and had to use them properly.",23,mtms2008-02-334a,,
"•  Many students at first will employ some version of guess and check, perhaps using a table. Over the years, I found that this is typical for beginning problem solvers as they slowly develop the ability to think mathematically. Even experienced problem solvers tackling an unfamiliar problem may just “try numbers” at first to get the feel for the problem.",24,mtms2008-02-334a,,

The sum of the marbles in the last five boxes is 85. What is the sum of the marbles in the last two boxes?",26,mtms2008-02-334a,,
"This problem is really a dressed-up version of “Find each of 5 consecutive odd integers if their sum is 85,” which is a standard algebra 1 problem.

This solution could have been shortened slightly by letting the variable represent the contents of the last box.",30,mtms2008-02-334a,,
"In my workshops with teachers, I have noticed that many of them have difficulty envisioning a nonalgebraic solution to such a problem. The difficulty seems to increase substantially when they are confronted with a standard coin or motion problem. Perhaps we have been taught too well! At this point, you, the reader, may want to test your ability to create a purely verbal solution to problem 1 before reading further. Perhaps when you reach the other problems, you might wish to try your hand with them, too.",31,mtms2008-02-334a,,
"Verbal solution 1: Consider only the  last five boxes. Suppose we skip the first box, remove 2 marbles from the second box, 4 marbles from the third, 6 from the fourth, and 8 from the last. Then all five boxes would have the same number of marbles, and the total number would be 65. Thus, each box would have 13 marbles. Restore the marbles we removed, and the last two boxes would contain 19 and 21 marbles. The sum of the marbles in the last two boxes is 40.",32,mtms2008-02-334a,,
"As in the algebraic solution, we added the 2, 4, 6, and 8; subtracted  last five boxes. Since there are an odd number of boxes, the average of their contents is the same as the number of marbles in the middle box. To understand this, picture a transfer of 2 marbles from the fourth box to the second and 4 marbles from the last box to the first. As a result, the total number of marbles is unchanged, but every box now has the same number of marbles. Thus, the middle box contains one-fifth of 85 marbles, or 17, marbles. The last two boxes originally contained a total of 40 marbles.",33,mtms2008-02-334a,,
"The two additional problems below can extend Benji’s box problem.  1.  Suppose Benji’s boxes contained, in  order, 1, 4, 7, . . . marbles, and he has 20 boxes, each with three more than the box before it.",34,mtms2008-02-334a,,

"The sum of the marbles in the last two boxes is 40. Subtly hidden in this solution is an interesting principle. Given an odd number of equally spaced terms (“arithmetic sequence”), the middle term is also the average of all the terms. For example, the average of 2, 5, and 8 is 5; the average of 35, 40, 45, 50, and 55 is 45; and the average of 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, and 98 is 94. In this case, y represents both the number of marbles in the middle box and the average number of marbles in the five boxes. For an even number of terms, the principle is slightly different.",37,mtms2008-02-334a,,
"Verbal solution 2: Solution 2 uses an approach that I have seen both students and teachers use increasingly in recent years. Although it is easy to show algebraically, I have only seen it used verbally. Consider only the  last box? b.  How many marbles are in all the  boxes, in all? 2.

It mirrors the algebraic solution perfectly. Interestingly enough, a different conversational approach also mirrors the algebraic one. The following solution appears to be similar but is conceptually opposite. In the first solution, we “leveled” the numbers by removing marbles. In the second solution, we will choose the simplest related case and then add marbles.",43,mtms2008-02-334a,,
"Verbal solution 2: Each box contains  2 more marbles than its predecessor. Choose the simplest case: Suppose the boxes contain 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 marbles. Our total of 20 marbles, then, is 65 short of the given total of 85. To maintain that common difference of 2, distribute the 65 marbles equally to each of the 5 boxes, adding 13 to each.

"Verbal solution 2: Compare Carlos’  purchase to Amanda’s. He pays $9 more than she, but in effect he swaps 3 of her CDs for 3 DVDs. Thus, each DVD must cost $3 more than each CD. If Amanda had bought a fifth CD instead of her 1 DVD, she would have paid $3 less than the $38 she really pays. That is, her 5 CDs would have cost $35, making the price $7 per CD. Since Amanda pays $28 for her 4 CDs, she pays the remaining $10 for her 1 DVD. Kobe therefore pays $17 for 1 CD and 1 DVD.",48,mtms2008-02-334a,,

This solution, somewhat less routine for algebra students, is wonderfully elegant. It drives directly toward the required answer much more efficiently than the more usual approaches used in algebraic solutions 1 and 2.

"By using problems similar to those that students will see in a later grade and helping them find their own way to a solution (Lenchner 2005, p. 11; Pólya 1957), we begin to embed the thinking processes in their minds. This can allow students to acquire a greater clarity and more intuitive comprehension when studying the appropriate procedures in algebra 1.",61,mtms2008-02-334a,,
"As an aside, I also recommend that  algebra 1 teachers themselves have students solve verbal problems conversationally as well as algebraically so as to impart the reasoning behind the technical steps (Lenchner 2005, pp. 103–9). The more ways a student looks at something, the deeper the understanding (Kalman 2004).",62,mtms2008-02-334a,,
Problem Solving,63,mtms2008-02-334a,,
"I believe that problem solving, not memorization, is the cornerstone of all mathematics. It seems to me that mathematics grew as the result of people looking for better ways to solve challenging problems. What we learned in school was usually the polished final result of their efforts, stripped of the very things that fascinated them so. I believe very strongly  that we should do all in our power to put back the mystery. Students respond much better to the journey than they do to the arrival. You need not take my word for it; NCTM named Problem Solving as its first Process Standard in Principles and Standards (NCTM 2000).",64,mtms2008-02-334a,,
"There are other benefits. Over the  years, I found several things to hold true. Students that were assigned a steady diet of demanding nonroutine problems tended to see standardized tests as nonthreatening and performed up to their abilities. Students who reasoned their own way through a problem retained principles and relationships more readily and fully. Students who were fed a steady diet of nonroutine problems knew they were shown respect. With experience, students improved in their problemsolving abilities, which resulted in greater self-confidence and greater mathematical thinking.",65,mtms2008-02-334a,,

"Often, young students are satisfied just to get “the answer.” To them, guess and check works well enough. But later on when they are in high school courses and taking college entrance exams, success is possible only by thinking mathematically. Questions often involve multiple principles, long chains of reasoning, and sometimes unexpected manipulations. Rote memorization of techniques can move the student toward success but only part of the way. The student must be able to reason his or her own way through to a solution. By our accepting their approaches to problems like those above, we help them become active learners and own the concepts, and we allow them to embed the algebraic reasoning they will need later. By encouraging several students to share with classmates several approaches to a problem, we expose every student to many concepts within each problem,  which intensifies the review of each concept over time, and we accustom students to speak publicly.",67,mtms2008-02-334a,,
"An interesting by-product of  building my teaching on appropriate nonroutine problems and encouraging the students to provide all the solutions was the timing, especially for average and below-average classes. For many problems, they volunteered two or three different methods. This took time. For the first third of the year, my classes usually fell far behind the other classes. As they began to “catch the feel” of thinking mathematically, their work sped up. By the end of the second third of the year, they always caught up to the other classes. By the end of the school year, they had covered all the required material in four to six weeks less time than those other classes, and they felt well prepared for the formal end-of-year exams.",68,mtms2008-02-334a,,
