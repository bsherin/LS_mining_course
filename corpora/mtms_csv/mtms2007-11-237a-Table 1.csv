"Randall Groth, regroth@ salisbury.edu, teaches in the education department at Salisbury University, Salisbury, MD 21804. He  is interested in the development of students’ and teachers’ statistical thinking, reasoning, and literacy.",3,mtms2007-11-237a,,
"The relationship between educational research and teaching practice has typically been stormy. Researchers and teachers sometimes seem to be operating under different agendas. Researchers are often interested in theoretical and general questions, whereas teachers are generally interested in solving problems related to situations that arise in classes each day (Labaree 2003). The valued currency in the research community is work that develops and refines theory, whereas practical application is valued in the community of educational practice (Silver 2003). Given  these contrasting objectives, the idea of linking research with practice can seem daunting. It has become imperative, however, for dialogue to occur between the two communities in light of legislation mandating research-based practices in schools (U.S. Department of Education 2002). ",4,mtms2007-11-237a,,
"Even though legislation provides one sort of motivation for teachers to consider research, I do not believe that it is the most compelling reason for dialogue between the communities of teaching and research. A two-way, cyclic flow of information between teachers and researchers can help strengthen both communities (Lesh and Lovitts 2000). Writing as someone who engages in both teaching and research, I find that doing research and studying that of others help strengthen my teaching practice. In turn, the process of teaching helps me uncover interesting research questions that may otherwise go undetected. In short, I believe the most compelling justification for dialogue between the worlds of research and teaching is simply that good research can help inform teaching practice, and that teaching can help inform research. As this cyclic dialogue occurs, teaching strengthens research just as research strengthens teaching. ",5,mtms2007-11-237a,,
"In this article, I will describe how two research studies about the teaching and learning of data analysis and probability helped inspire a lesson I taught for a group of eighth-grade students. First, a brief description of the two studies will be given. Second, the lesson itself and students’ thinking will be described. Third, to provide a complete example of the type of cyclic dialogue that can occur between teaching practice and research, I will give some examples of researchable questions that were generated from the lesson.",6,mtms2007-11-237a,,
two studies inspiRinG the FaiRness oF dice lesson,7,mtms2007-11-237a,,
"The lesson described in this article was partially prompted by a study of students’ reasoning about the fairness of dice (Watson and Moritz 2003). As part of the study, 108 middle school students were interviewed on their beliefs about the fairness of dice and the strategies they used to determine fairness. Without their knowledge, students were given dice that had been intentionally altered to favor certain outcomes. ",8,mtms2007-11-237a,,
"Several different beliefs emerged. Some students believed that certain numbers were “luckier” than others on any given die, whereas others believed that all dice were fair. Still others believed that fair results are obtained if dice are rolled several times, but that in the short term, variation in outcomes is likely to occur. Students used several types of strategies during interviews to determine the fairness of dice. Some students simply asserted that all dice were fair without performing any trials. Others examined the physical characteristics of the dice or performed a few unsystematic trials. Still others actually conducted trial rolls and recorded the results systematically. Given this wide array of beliefs and strategies related to the fairness of dice, Watson and Moritz (2003) noted that instead of beginning instruction with the assumption that all dice are fair, “it may be more appropriate to put questioning the fairness of the random number generator high on the curriculum agenda” (p. 302).",9,mtms2007-11-237a,,
"The second study that helped  inspire the lesson described here was conducted by McClain and Cobb (2001). The researchers described a teaching approach that helped middle school students engage in the process of genuine data analysis. A key element of the approach was to pose problems that required students to produce arguments grounded in data  rather than simply apply prescribed computation procedures. Students were asked to work with one another to draw conclusions from data. Whole-class discussions provided forums for justifying conclusions to one another. For example, in one classroom activity, students were to examine data on braking distance from several different automobiles, then defend their conclusions during class discussions. Even though students were not told to use specific statistical procedures, during classroom discussions they came to see features such as the range, the median, and maximum and minimum values as being important features of data sets. Through this process, students who previously thought of statistics as a collection of computational and graphing techniques began to view the subject instead as a discipline concerned with explaining and justifying solutions to genuine problems. McClain and Cobb characterized this type of instruction as “a radically different approach to statistics than is typically introduced in middle schools” (p. 126). ",10,mtms2007-11-237a,,
"The Watson and Moritz (2003)  and McClain and Cobb (2001) studies each shaped the lesson described in this article in distinct ways. The Watson and Moritz study prompted the focus of the lesson to be on developing students’ understanding of testing the fairness of random number generators. McClain and Cobb posit that discussion of a genuine data analysis problem should be central to the lesson. As I wrote the lesson, I was curious to see if my students would exhibit beliefs and strategies similar to those documented by Watson and Moritz. Assuming that a variety of beliefs and strategies would emerge, I was also curious to see how discourse about a genuine data analysis problem might help shape students’ beliefs and strategies, as in the McClain and Cobb study.  the FaiRness oF dice lesson",11,mtms2007-11-237a,,
"To begin the lesson, I decided to spark students’ thinking about the concept of fairness. I introduced students to a game called “race to the top” (van de Walle 2007). The instructions and game board are shown in figure 1. Before playing, I asked students to write about whether or not they thought the game was fair, meaning that it gave both players an equal chance of winning. Eight of ten students felt that it was a fair game because each player had the same number of favorable outcomes. Two students thought that some numbers on any given die were more likely to come up than others, so each player did not necessarily have the same chance of winning. Student comments included these: ",12,mtms2007-11-237a,,
I think it is fair because each player has 3 numbers to score from. ,13,mtms2007-11-237a,,
"Yes, because both players have 3 sides they can get a point. The only thing is that some person might be more lucky than the other and he might get more points than the unlucky one.",14,mtms2007-11-237a,,

"Instructions: Take turns with your partner rolling a die. Player 1 scores by rolling a 1, 2, or 3, and player 2 scores by rolling a 4, 5, or 6. Keep track of the game’s progress in the chart below:",17,mtms2007-11-237a,,

"Each time player 1 rolls a 1, 2, or 3, place an “X” in one of the ten empty spaces in the player 1 column. Each time player 2 rolls a 4, 5, or 6, place an “X” in one of the ten empty spaces in the player 2 column. The first player to reach the top wins.",22,mtms2007-11-237a,,
None of the students mentioned that a balanced die would be a necessary element to make the game fair. ,23,mtms2007-11-237a,,
"After students finished writing their thoughts about the fairness of “race to the top,” I asked them to play a round of the game with a partner. I gave each pair a die that was heavily weighted to roll either all 1’s or all 6’s. As they rolled the dice, many students quickly realized that the game they were playing was not fair, since one of the two players scored virtually all the points. Some students physically examined the dice and noticed that it looked as if one side had been cut out. Playing the game in this way quickly drew most students’ attention to the fact that not all dice are necessarily fair random number generators. When I asked students whether or not  the game was fair after they played it, most said that it was not. However, two students still thought the game was fair. One student explained that he thought the number 1 was just lucky for him but that each player still had an equal chance of winning. ",24,mtms2007-11-237a,,
"Since the question of the fairness  of dice had been triggered by the “race to the top” game, we pursued it further as a class. I led a group brainstorming session on the question, “How can we determine if a given die is fair?” As students volunteered strategies, I recorded them on the board. Some suggested some sort of physical examination of the die, and others opted for gathering and analyzing data from rolling it. Physical examination strategies included setting the die on a corner to observe how it fell when  released, cutting it open to examine it, and placing it against a piece of metal to see if it contained a magnet. Some of those who suggested rolling the die felt that ten rolls would give sufficient data, whereas others thought that it would be necessary to trade the die with a partner as he or she rolled it to make sure that the way the die was rolled did not influence the outcome. At this point, none of the students mentioned the idea that increasing the number of rolls would provide more evidence from which to judge. ",25,mtms2007-11-237a,,
"After a number of ideas about  judging fairness had been generated, I gave each pair of students a red die and a white die. I told them that one die had been modified to favor certain outcomes and the other was sold as a fair die. I withheld the informa-",26,mtms2007-11-237a,,

Fig. 3 Poster from students arguing that the white die was fair tion that the red die had been shaved 40/1000 of an inch by the manufacturer to favor a roll of 6. This subtle modification of the red die was much less obvious than the heavy weighting of the die used for the game at the beginning of the lesson. I told students that it was their job to determine which die was which. They were then to construct and present a poster to convince the rest of the class that they had made the correct choice. ,28,mtms2007-11-237a,,
"Students’ posters included a variety of different strategies for determining the fairness of dice. They drew fairly heavily on the strategies discussed during the earlier group brainstorming session. Pairs of students tended to favor either physically examining the dice or gathering data from rolling the dice. As they gave their poster presentations, a number of conclusions about the question of which die was fair were forwarded: Some felt the red die was fair, some felt white was fair, and still others thought that both were fair (see figs. 2, 3, and 4). At this point, students wanted me to simply tell them which die was which. However, I pressed them a bit further, saying that I did not think we had done all we could to settle the question. When I asked them about other strategies, some discussed getting out a scale or cutting open the dice. When I said that those strategies would be impossible in the context of our lesson, a student who had gathered data by rolling each die ten times suggested that all the pairs should put together a larger group of data from rolling the dice a number of times. Others agreed that this would be a helpful approach. ",29,mtms2007-11-237a,,
"To follow up on the suggestion of  pooling the data from a number of rolls of each die, we constructed two Post-it note displays as a class. Each time that students rolled one die, they were to record the outcome on a Post-it note. They were then asked to place their Post-it notes in the appropriate display  (see fig. 5). One display tracked outcomes from rolling the red die, and the other tracked the white. The displays somewhat resembled histograms, since they showed the frequency of occurrence for each possible outcome. ",30,mtms2007-11-237a,,
"Once the class data displays had been assembled, I asked students to  examine them to see if they helped us determine the fairness of the dice. One student immediately noticed that it was somewhat difficult to read the displays because the Post-it notes had not been evenly spaced. She volunteered to go to the board to count the Post-it notes in each column and ",31,mtms2007-11-237a,,

"Fig. 5 Class Post-it note display record the result below each one. Two other students helped her. Their work is shown as part of figure 5. Since the 6 was rolled most often for the red (16 times), it led some students to believe that the red die was not fair. At the same time, there was still doubt about the fairness of the white die because the 5 was rolled 17 times. As we discussed the two displays, some students reverted to physically examining the dice to help settle the question, since the graphical evidence seemed inconclusive. For example, some talked about the way each die bounced when it was dropped, and others remarked on the size of the dots, or pips, on each die. ",33,mtms2007-11-237a,,
"Even though the data seemed  inconclusive, I wanted to draw students’ attention back to ways that we might continue to gather data to help determine which die was fair. I posed the question of how a data display for a fair die might look if we gathered more observations. One student, who had reverted to physical examination after the data seemed inconclusive, suggested that such a display would be “mostly flat, with a few bumps.” When I asked him to draw what he meant, he produced the diagram shown in figure 6. His work suggested that he was beginning to develop at least an intuitive understanding of the probability distribution fitting the situation. Before this point in the ",34,mtms2007-11-237a,,
"Fig. 6 one student’s portrayal of distributions from rolling fair and unfair dice lesson, he had suggested only physical examination strategies for determining the fairness of dice. ",35,mtms2007-11-237a,,
"By the time all these events had  unfolded, my one-hour block of time was up. Since this lesson was part of a university visit by the students, and I would not be seeing them again to gather more data to determine which die was fair, I told them that the red die had been shaved to favor 6’s and that the white die was sold as fair. I mentioned that just because a die is sold as fair does not necessarily mean that it is fair. Many die that are sold as fair are, in fact, not weighted equally on each side (Peterson 1998). I left them with this point in hopes of stimulating their thinking about another important statistical principle: Answers to statistical questions are rarely as clear-cut as answers to mathematical ones. Although mathematics problems can generally be solved precisely through deductive logic, solutions to statistical problems are bound to specific contexts and contain varying degrees of certainty (Rossman, Chance, and Medina 2006).  coMpletinG the cycle: ReseaRch Questions spaRked by teachinG  the lesson",36,mtms2007-11-237a,,
"As mentioned earlier, this lesson was inspired by McClain and Cobb (2001) and Watson and Moritz (2003). Given the desirability of cyclical dialogue between research and teaching practice (Lesh and Lovitts 2000), I will describe some research questions that were inspired by this lesson. My list of research questions is by no means exhaustive, and I encourage readers to identify some of their own questions about the lesson that would merit investigation.",37,mtms2007-11-237a,,
"The research questions that interested me the most involved the psychological concept of transfer. Bransford, Brown, and Cocking (1999)  spoke of transfer as something that “allows students to apply what was learned in new situations and to learn related information more quickly” (p. 17). They illustrated the concept with an example from geography, stating that a student who understands the significance of the Mississippi River to the United States will understand the geographic importance of the Nile to Egypt if knowledge is successfully transferred from one context to the other. However, successful transfer does not always occur with students. For example, research has shown that some students see no relationship between the task of counting money and the computational procedures they were taught in school (Carraher, Carraher, and Schliemann 1985). ",38,mtms2007-11-237a,,
"I had hoped that students would transfer several statistical concepts embedded in the lesson to other situations. Most students assumed that the dice they would be given to play “race to the top” were fair. Most shed that assumption, however, after experience with loaded dice, and participated in an investigation of the fairness of different dice. My hope was that they would transfer the same critical disposition to other situations involving random number generators like spinners, numbers pulled at random out of a hat, and computer-generated random numbers. Therefore, an interesting research question coming out of this lesson was this: To what extent would students transfer their beliefs and strategies for testing the fairness of dice to other situations involving random number generators? Those who teach a lesson similar to the one described here would be able to address this question with their own students by conducting followup lessons that involve other kinds of random number generators and taking note of students’ patterns of reasoning. ",39,mtms2007-11-237a,,
"During the lesson, some students also seemed to move toward an intuitive understanding of the idea that the more random observations one collects, the closer one can expect to approximate theoretical probability. This type of understanding was shown by the student who recommended pooling a number of observations from different members of the class to make a more accurate determination about which die was loaded. It is uncertain, however, the extent to which this intuitive understanding might transfer to other situations. Would the students understand, for example, that a presidential election poll with a large random sample is more likely to be accurate than one with a small random sample? Research I had done earlier (Groth 2006) suggested that understanding the role of sample size in such cases can be fairly difficult for students. Teachers who try this activity with their own classes can investigate this question by probing students’ thinking further after they have completed the activity. ",40,mtms2007-11-237a,,
"Finally, I also wondered if negative transfer had influenced the way that the students participated. Negative transfer occurs when knowledge gained in one setting interferes with knowledge acquisition in another (Woolfolk 1993). There are important differences between statistical and mathematical reasoning. Although one can often expect one correct answer to a mathematical question, answers to statistical questions need to be qualified with a degree of uncertainty. Since students were told in advance that they would be participating in a mathematical lesson, they may have transferred the expectation of finding one clearly correct answer to the fairness of dice problem to this situation from their experiences in mathematics classes. Throughout the lesson, they repeatedly expressed the desire for me to tell them the “correct” answer. By questioning students on their beliefs about mathematics (Dossey et al. 2002), one  could begin to determine the extent to which their experiences with mathematics may transfer negatively to statistical settings.  conclusion",41,mtms2007-11-237a,,
"There is a need for constant dialogue between the worlds of teaching and research. As such dialogue occurs, the overall profession of mathematics education is strengthened. I encourage readers to look into the research questions I have outlined in this article or seek their own to investigate. Ultimately, students reap the benefits as we traverse continuously between the worlds of teaching and research and use insights gained in one domain to strengthen the other. ",42,mtms2007-11-237a,,
