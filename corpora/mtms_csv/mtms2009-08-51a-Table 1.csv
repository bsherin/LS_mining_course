"Using Curriculum to  Focus on Understanding “Effective mathematics teaching requires understanding what students know and need to learn and then challenging and supporting them to learn it well” (The Teaching Principle, Principles and Standards for School Mathematics,  p. 16). District-provided curriculum materials (e.g., textbooks) are the primary influence on how teachers organize their mathematics instruction. However, most teachers do not simply use the textbook as written; they adapt it to their students’ needs, state or district mandates, and their own beliefs about teaching and learning mathematics. Teachers’ interaction with curriculum materials is the focus of this month’s Contemporary Curriculum Issues articles in the three NCTM school journals—Teaching Children Mathematics (TCM), Mathematics Teaching in the Middle School (MTMS), and the Mathematics Teacher (MT). This month’s articles examine teachers’ use of curriculum materials through the lens of curriculum vision and coherence. Each article considers these questions: How do we learn to use and adapt impersonal curriculum materials in ways that allow us to meet our students’ needs and address the multiple standards and objectives for which we and our students are responsible? What issues and questions might we consider in making decisions about our use of curriculum materials? All three articles are written by the team of Michelle Cirillo, Corey Drake, and Beth Herbel-Eisenmann. The TCM article observes Nancy, a second- and third-grade teacher, as she builds a coherent view of her curriculum. The MTMS article presents the case of Stacey, a seventh- and eighth-grade teacher, as she plans with and enacts her curriculum vision. The MT article follows Matt, a high school geometry teacher, as he works to implement his curriculum vision. We urge you to read all three articles.",2,mtms2009-08-51a,,
"This department provides a forum to stimulate discussion on contemporary curricular issues across a K–12 audience. NCTM plans to publish sets of three articles, focused on a single curriculum issue. Each article will address the issue from the perspective of the audience of the journal in which it appears. Collectively, the articles are intended to increase communication and dialogue on issues of common interest related to curriculum. Manuscripts on any contemporary curriculum issues are welcome. Submissions can be for one article for one particular journal, or they can be for a series of three articles, one for each journal. Submit manuscripts at the appropriate Web site: tcm.msubmit.net, mtms.msubmit.net, or mt.msubmit.net, or contact editors Barbara Reys (reysb@ missouri.edu) for TCM, Glenda Lappan (glappan@math.msu.edu) for MTMS, or Christian  Hirsch (christian.hirsch@wmich.edu) for MT.",3,mtms2009-08-51a,,
"The relationship that teachers have with their curriculum materials often resembles, at best, “an arranged marriage” (The El Barrio-Hunter College PDS Partnership Writing Collective 2009).  In some cases, this arrangement is compatible, and teachers feel comfortable using the materials as written. In many cases, it is not. At the same time, in an era of rigorous  assessment and accountability systems, teachers often face long lists of mathematics topics or learning expectations that need to be addressed throughout the school year (NCTM 2006). More specifically, classroom teachers are expected to address national standards (e.g., NCTM 2000), state standards, and district standards using mass- produced curriculum materials that were not written for their unique contexts or for their individual students. Despite these potential incompat- ibilities, mathematics teachers tend to rely heavily on commercial curriculum materials as their primary tool for teaching mathematics (Grouws, Smith, and Sztajn 2004). Several questions come to mind: 1.  How do we learn to use and adapt  impersonal curriculum materials in ways that allow us to meet our students’ needs and address the multiple standards and objectives for which we and our students are responsible?  2.  What kinds of issues and questions might we consider in making decisions about our use of curriculum materials? ",4,mtms2009-08-51a,,
"In this article, we describe curriculum vision; it includes an understanding of the mathematics that students must learn and a coherent trajectory (or set of trajectories) for learning that mathematics. We propose that teachers who manage the complex task of monitoring students’ mathematical needs as well as standards and objectives have a well-defined curriculum vision. We offer suggestions for ways that teachers can reflect on and articulate this view.",5,mtms2009-08-51a,,

"Researchers have suggested that successful teachers need to develop a “curriculum vision.” For example, ",7,mtms2009-08-51a,,

"Darling-Hammond et al. (2005) claimed that “well-prepared teachers have developed a sense of ‘where they are going’ and how they and their students are going to get there”  (p. 177). We propose that a teacher with a well-defined curriculum vision has a deep understanding of— 1.  “big mathematical ideas,” or goals  of the curriculum;  2.  the multiple trajectories that  students might take to reach those goals; and  3.  strategies for using, adapting,  supplementing, or creating curriculum materials to support students in reaching those goals. ",15,mtms2009-08-51a,,
An important component of curriculum vision is curriculum coherence— mathematical connections that can be made by both students and teachers— within and across lessons. ,16,mtms2009-08-51a,,
"In the sections that follow, we offer suggestions and questions to help teachers develop, plan, and enact their curriculum vision. We also present data from interviews with Stacey, a middle school mathematics teacher, to  show the kinds of issues and questions that teachers might consider as they think through curricular issues.  deVeloping a  curriculuM Vision The idea that a mathematics curriculum should be coherent is advocated in Principles and Standards for School Mathematics: “A curriculum is more than a collection of activities: it must be coherent, focused on important mathematics, and well articulated across the grades” (NCTM 2000, p. 14). We believe that this kind of coherence can be achieved through the development and enactment of curriculum vision. ",17,mtms2009-08-51a,,
"NCTM’s recommendations that  different content “should receive different emphases across the grade bands” (see fig. 1) can help teachers think about the big ideas that students might learn throughout the year. For example, teachers could ask, “How much emphasis should I place on algebra at each grade level?” Teachers can consult NCTM’s Curriculum Focal Points for Prekindergarten through Grade 8 Mathematics (2006) to help ",18,mtms2009-08-51a,,
"Fig. 2 Questions to consider in developing curriculum vision and coherence •	What	are	the	“big	ideas”	(important	mathematical	content)	that	I	want	 students	to	learn?	How	can	I	use	NCTM’s	Curriculum Focal Points (2006) to help me focus on a smaller number of key areas of emphasis? •	Is	my	curriculum	coherent	and	focused,	rather	than	a	collection	of	activities	 or	topics?	How	do	I	create	coherence	or	connections	across	these	ideas? •	What	are	the	ways	through	which	I	want	my	students	to	acquire	and	use	 this	content	knowledge?	In	other	words,	how	can	I	teach	this	content,	 while still addressing the important mathematical processes?  •	What	do	I	see	as	the	balance	among	skills,	procedures,	and	concepts? •	How	do	my	own	knowledge,	beliefs,	and	experiences	fit	into	this	vision? •	How	do	my	individual	students’	needs	influence	my	curriculum	vision? •	How	do	I	consider	particular	features	of	high-quality	mathematics	education	(e.g.,	NCTM’s	Principles)	as	guides	and	tools	for	making	decisions	 about curriculum? them focus on a smaller number of key areas of emphasis. Other questions might concern the focus and coherence of the curriculum, connections within and across mathematical topics, and the relationship between curriculum content and pedagogy. Teachers may consider how the content will be delivered to students. Finally, in developing their curriculum vision, teachers will want to reflect on and include their own beliefs as well as consider them in light of their particular school and district. We provide specific questions for teachers to consider in figure 2.  hoW stacey deVeloped a curriculuM Vision",19,mtms2009-08-51a,,
Stacey’s early teaching reflected how she was taught: ,20,mtms2009-08-51a,,
"My mathematics instruction for the first several years of my teaching was traditional in that I taught the concepts and algorithms and expected students to practice them repeatedly. This is how I learned mathematics, and I had never thought of other possibilities.",21,mtms2009-08-51a,,
"However, after reading NCTM’s Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for School Mathematics (1989) and attending conferences, Stacey’s thinking  about mathematics teaching began to change. These professional activities caused Stacey to reflect on her own practice and realize new possibilities for teaching mathematics in more meaningful ways.",22,mtms2009-08-51a,,
"As her goals changed, she became  interested in using an NSF-funded, Standards-based curriculum program to further her vision that “students need to learn mathematics conceptually with a focus on understanding.” When asked to describe her ideal teaching situation, Stacey mentioned these curriculum materials: ",23,mtms2009-08-51a,,
"It would be ideal to be able to use the type of materials that fit my philosophy, and I do. I haven’t always and now I do. Ideal to me is to be able to use a more investigative type of curriculum and be able to supplement with skill work, rather than the other way around.",24,mtms2009-08-51a,,
"Although Stacey was satisfied with  the materials she was using, she also found that enacting the lessons in those curriculum materials required a clear sense of both her role and that of her students. She said that students in her classroom should take charge of their own learning: “It’s not up to me to open up the think tank and  pour it in. It’s [their] job to work with me and figure it out.” Although she expected her students to be active learners, she also believed that she, herself, played an important role:",25,mtms2009-08-51a,,
"My role is to make the curriculum come alive. My role is to help [my students] see mathematics in a way that is meaningful, that is useful . . . and to facilitate that learning. . . . My role is to assess that learning and figure out when it’s happening, when it’s not happening, and how I can get it to happen.",26,mtms2009-08-51a,,
"Stacey found this new role to be challenging. Rather than directly teaching the material as she had done in the past, she now believed that her role included setting expectations for students to engage with the mathematics and creating a climate that nurtured these expectations.",27,mtms2009-08-51a,,
hoW stacey enacted her curriculuM Vision,28,mtms2009-08-51a,,
"Stacey described at least three aspects of how she planned with and enacted her curriculum vision:  1.  She took advantage of the smaller unit booklets provided in one particular program.  2.  She believed that to meet the district standards, she needed to insert skill work after the development of mathematical concepts.",29,mtms2009-08-51a,,
3.  She took seriously her role as facilitator to support students in highlevel mathematical discussions. ,30,mtms2009-08-51a,,
One of Stacey’s professional responsibilities was to order new curriculum materials for the middle school. She appreciated the flexibility offered by the smaller unit booklets  in one particular program because the units focused on mathematical strands rather than sets of (often unrelated) topics. She consulted with the high school mathematics teachers to  planning and enacting your curriculum Vision,31,mtms2009-08-51a,,
"One	important	step	in	planning	to	enact	a	curriculum	vision	is	to	“look	at	your	 curriculum	and	begin	to	organize	it	into	more	coherent	instruction”	(Mirra	 2008,	p.	7).	That	is,	examining	the	existing	district	or	state	curriculum	guides	 in conjunction with available curriculum materials can provide a starting point for planning with and enacting a curriculum vision. When looking at curriculum materials, teachers might identify the curriculum vision (either implicit or explicit)	of	its	authors.	They	can	then	consider	how	their	curriculum	vision	is	 aligned with or different from that of the curriculum materials and how their standards	fit	into	this	vision.	To	achieve	coherence	across	the	grade	levels,	 teachers	should	also	consider	their	students’	prior	mathematics	and	what	they	 will	need	to	know	for	subsequent	courses.	At	that	time,	decisions	can	be	made	 about using and adapting the materials. Finally, it is useful for teachers to consider	how	their	curriculum	vision	will	influence	their	lessons	and	their	interactions	with	students	during	instruction.	The	following	questions	might	be	asked	 when planning with and enacting a curriculum vision: •	 What	is	the	implicit	curriculum	vision	of	the	authors	of	my	curriculum	materials? •	 In	what	ways	is	my	curriculum	vision	aligned	with,	or	different	from,	that	of	 my curriculum materials? •	 How	do	the	standards	and	objectives	of	my	state	and	district	fit	into	this	 vision? •	 How	do	I	take	into	account	not	only	the	horizontal	curriculum	(within	my	 course) but also the vertical curriculum (across the grade band)? •	 How	can	I	use	my	curriculum	materials	as	a	tool	to	achieve	my	curriculum	 vision? •	 Do	I	need	to	adapt,	reorganize,	or	delete	elements	of	the	curriculum	materi- als?	If	so,	how? •	 Do	I	need	to	supplement	the	curriculum	materials	with	additional	ideas	or	 activities?	If	so,	how? •	 How	does	my	curriculum	vision	impact	the	ways	that	I	interact	with	my	 students? •	 How	do	my	individual	students	and	their	mathematical	thinking	influence	 my curriculum vision? consider the vertical curriculum in this decision. With their recommendations and the district standards in mind, Stacey decided to purchase seventhgrade and eighth-grade units related to rational number and proportional reasoning, algebra, and area and volume. She used the teacher’s guides, which provided information about how the units were related to one another and which suggested multiple ways in which key mathematical ideas in the units built on one another. She then considered how these units might fit together coherently.",32,mtms2009-08-51a,,
"Although the new materials offered many high-level tasks organized  toward building big mathematical ideas, she was concerned about meeting the district’s goals related to procedural fluency. Her experience taught her that it was easier to supplement high-quality, understandingbased curriculum materials with skill work than to build a rich, high-quality curriculum around a conventional, skill-based textbook. ",33,mtms2009-08-51a,,
"Stacey’s principal asked her how she figured out how to supplement the skill work. She carefully identified the topics in her local curriculum that were not covered in the materials. Then she determined where to insert direct instruction to cover these topics,  keeping in mind the balance of developing big mathematical ideas along with promoting procedural fluency. She considered these questions:  •	 “Where	is	the	best	place	to	put	 that in?”  •	 “How	much	[skill	work]	is	the	best	 to put in?” ",34,mtms2009-08-51a,,
"Describing the situation as hit and miss and inconsistent, she eventually found an appropriate balance through trial and error. Stacey’s goal was to spend about two-thirds of class time working through the investigations and about one-third having students practice skills across a two-week time frame. She created practice sheets to follow each key concept and facilitated discussions that connected back to the big ideas of the investigations.",35,mtms2009-08-51a,,
"She said that when first using the  new curriculum materials, she was unsure about her approach. As she became comfortable with the high-level tasks and familiar with how students would respond to them, however, her vision related to her role and the role of her students became clearer. ",36,mtms2009-08-51a,,
"As her curriculum vision was re- fined, she began to concentrate on the “summarize” (Lappan et al. 1997) part of the lesson that follows the explorations in small groups. Typically carried out through whole-class discussion, this summary time highlights and pulls together key mathematical ideas As Stacey worked at being explicit regarding what she expected from her students, their explanations and justifications became more detailed and conceptual over time. She found that having students talk about the mathematics helped her assess their growing understanding of the mathematical content. Ongoing formative assessments also helped Stacey pace her lessons and guide her planning for the next day. She found that continual  adjustments were necessary to meet the needs of her individual students and support their mathematical understanding.",37,mtms2009-08-51a,,
conclusion,38,mtms2009-08-51a,,
"After reading the NCTM Standards (1989, 2000) and attending conferences, Stacey began to see that there was a different way to teach mathematics that was unlike her experiences as a student and a beginning teacher. She also used her experiences with a rich curriculum program and her knowledge of her students and mathematics to develop a curriculum vision that allowed her to enact coherent mathematics courses. Stacey continues to reflect on and develop her teaching, working to align her curriculum vision with her practice. ",39,mtms2009-08-51a,,
"Many frequently changing factors influence classroom teachers’ practices: national, state, and district standards;  textbook adoptions; technological advancements; and research about student learning. One constant, however, is teachers’ daily interactions with their students. Ultimately, the teacher must do what is best for his or her students. Taking Stacey’s lead, teachers can use curriculum materials resourcefully and adapt them to their students in their own particular contexts. In fact, we believe that teachers are the only ones who can do this, since they are most familiar with their students, their school, and their community. Teachers need not do this work alone, however; developing curriculum vision can be a collaborative journey within and across mathematics departments.",40,mtms2009-08-51a,,
