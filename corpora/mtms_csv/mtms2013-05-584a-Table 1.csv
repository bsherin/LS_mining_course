"Computer programmers use circuits, which can be programmed off or on. When a circuit is off, it is represented as 0; when on, it is 1. This system forces programmers to represent information using only 0 and 1, or a base 2 number system. The number 1010111 can be read in base 2. Expanded notation for this binary number is similar to expanded notation in the base 10 system:  1010111base 2 = (1 × 26)                      = 87base 10 + (0 × 25) + (1 × 24) + (0 × 23) + (1 × 22) + (1 × 21) + (1 × 20)  1.  a.  Write the following base 10 numbers as binary numbers: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64. Represent each using base 2 blocks (i.e., similar to base 10 blocks). How do these representations compare?",2,mtms2013-05-584a,,
