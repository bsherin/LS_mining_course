3,Deciphering Multiplication Algorithms with the Area Model,"t“Ta-da! We got the answer!” This was  the first reaction of many prospective teachers in my K-grade 8 mathematics methods course when several alternative multiplication algorithms were presented. It seemed that prospective teachers initially treated alternative algorithms as magical tricks without paying much attention to the meanings behind the procedures. This initial reaction changed when these teachers were given the opportunity to explore and explain why the algorithms work. It was particularly interesting to see their efforts to connect the unfamiliar algorithms with the ways in which they understood the standard algorithms. Prospective teachers developed area models for two of the alternative multiplication algorithms, Egyptian multiplication and Russian peasant multiplication, and gave a reason for each step of the algorithms based on those area  models. This article discusses how these teachers deciphered the alternative multiplication algorithms using ",3,Deciphering Multiplication Algorithms with the Area Model

5,Deciphering Multiplication Algorithms with the Area Model,"There is no doubt that it is more important to justify and explain “why a particular mathematical statement is true or where a mathematical rule comes from” (CCSSI 2010, p. 4) than to simply apply the memorized stepby-step procedures. Researchers have reported that students’ lack of understanding of algorithms could serve as an anchor for various systemic computational errors (e.g., Ashlock 2010). To prevent this situation, educators have suggested providing opportunities for students to examine the meaning of the standard algorithms and explore their own invented strategies or alternative algorithms (NCTM 1998). ",5,Deciphering Multiplication Algorithms with the Area Model
6,Deciphering Multiplication Algorithms with the Area Model,"The standard algorithm as used in  the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSM) refers to “a particular mathematical approach that is based on place value and properties of operations” and relies on “the particular approach of decomposing numbers into base-ten units and then carrying out single-digit computations with those units” (Fuson and Beckmann 2012/2013, p. 15). Therefore, the standard algorithm has a digit orientation and can be explained with various written methods, using a visual model at the initial stage (see Fuson and Beckmann 2012/2013 for written methods for the standard algorithms for four operations). Although the place for alternative (or nonstandard) algorithms is not uniformly set for school mathematics, teacher educators often use various alternative algorithms as a part of the curriculum for their mathematics teacher education programs. This underscores their historical or cultural aspects or underlying mathematical structures to promote teachers’ awareness and understanding (e.g., Lin 2007/2008; Nugent 2007; Pickreign and Rogers 2006; Simonsen and Teppo 1999).  20 10 10 2 × 10 20 × 10 discUssing MUltiplication algorithMs Using an area Model",6,Deciphering Multiplication Algorithms with the Area Model

Some also considered (a + b)2 = a2 + 2ab + b2 to be a kind of definition that they had to memorize.

22,Deciphering Multiplication Algorithms with the Area Model,"For accuracy and generality, prospective teachers checked whether these algorithms worked in a variety of circumstances through inductive reasoning. Although the prospective teachers did not come up with the generalizable forms (e.g., using algebraic relations), they executed a number of problems with wholenumber factors using the aforementioned steps and confirmed that these algorithms consistently produce correct answers and could be applied to various problems. ",22,Deciphering Multiplication Algorithms with the Area Model
23,Deciphering Multiplication Algorithms with the Area Model,"In terms of efficiency and ease of accurate use, evaluations were mixed. The algorithms requiring only halving and doubling were considered an advantage. However, it was noted that the procedure got longer and more complicated when the size of the factor increased, whereas it was less complicated to execute with smaller factors. Although the discussions of other aspects went smoothly, it took a while to investigate the mathematical validity of these algorithms. Some prospective teachers felt that the “peasant” multiplication algorithm might not be mathematically valid because it was assumed to be a method used for a less educated (peasant) population. A turning point occurred when several prospective teachers attempted to relate the area model they previously used to explain the standard multiplication algorithm to these alternative algorithms. As they expanded the area model for whole-number multiplication to the cases of general and specific binomial multiplication, they tried to apply the area model to make sense of the alternative algorithms.

114,Deciphering Multiplication Algorithms with the Area Model,"The class discussions ultimately lead to unpacking the alternative algorithms using the area model. Evidently, the geometric interpretation of the alternative algorithms is not a unique approach. It can be explained using numeric expressions (e.g., Simonsen and Teppo 1999) or it can be justified with other generalized forms (e.g., Gimmestad 1991). I would suggest that classroom teachers and teacher educators think about potential extensions to this activity, which will in turn stimulate further meaningful discussions. One such extension can explore ways in which these algorithms can be used more efficiently. For example, when calculating 22 × 15 using the Egyptian multiplication algorithm, the process could have been a bit simpler than the way presented in this article if we had continuously doubled the larger factor (22) (i.e., fewer rows would have needed to be written). Teachers in my class checked the accuracy of this algorithm during the class discussion by exploring multiple examples or by investigating if the commutative property worked (i.e., regardless of which factor is doubled, this algorithm yields the same product). However, these teachers did not pay much attention to the more efficient way of using this algorithm. As we emphasize “attending to precision”  (CCSSI 2010, p. 7) and expect our students to perform calculations not only accurately but also efficiently, this type of extension activity would bring up worthwhile discussion.

117,Deciphering Multiplication Algorithms with the Area Model,"One obvious pattern found in the sequence of factors that consistently produces odd numbers by continuously being halved in this algorithm (1, 3, 5, 7, 15, 31 . . . ) is that these factors can be generalized as 2n – 1 (n	≥ 1). Likewise, the factors that always yield even numbers by repeatedly dividing in half (2, 4, 8, 16 . . .) can be represented as 2n (n	≥ 1). These extension prompts would provide prospective teachers with the opportunity to see the power of “looking for and making use of structure” in mathematical practice (CCSSI 2010, p. 8) and help them refine and strengthen their mathematical understanding.

Consequently, these forms are often treated like magical number tricks and criticized for the difficulty they cause students in relating the common standard algorithms.

The prospective teachers’ interpretations of two alternative algorithms via geometric interpretation promoted their deeper understanding as evidenced while addressing the quantitative and qualitative relationships and flexibly composing and decomposing numbers. This task also helped me witness the importance of providing in-depth and coherent investigation opportunities in the teacher education program. At the end, the prospective teachers were very excited about their interpretation of the two alternative algorithms.
