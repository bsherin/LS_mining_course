14,Books and Products,"Reflective and Collaborative Processes to Improve Mathematics Teaching, by title, may seem too general for those seeking concrete, practical  strategies to enhance current classroom practices. However, readers will find that the authors of the twentyfour short chapters clearly and succinctly describe the processes, frameworks, tools, and outcomes of various research and professional development initiatives in a manner that is focused, accessible, organized, ",14,Books and Products

16,Books and Products,"and easy to read. A main theme throughout the book is illustrating specific collaborations among various combinations of K–12 teachers, district leaders, university educators, mathematicians, and preservice teachers. The content both stimulates long-term reflection and inspires the desire to adapt parts of models to “try it right now.” The text includes many real classroom examples with additional resources available online through NCTM’s More4U. ",16,Books and Products
17,Books and Products,"It is encouraging that this book  explicitly promotes the value of teachers proactively directing professional growth experiences and contributing to the body of professional knowledge. This comes across strongly in part 1 where the chapters emphasize the impact of “the teacher’s voice” beyond the local level. Part 3 includes specific structures for collaboratively examining instructional practices, such as the Live Classroom, the Mathematically Productive Habits and Routines observation tool, and the Iceberg Model. Part 5 offers thoughtful approaches for those who engage with preservice teachers, especially for structuring today’s shifting roles and responsibilities. References to research correspond to current and respected works, and the present challenges faced in mathematics education are realistically acknowledged. ",17,Books and Products
18,Books and Products,I believe that this volume will be  useful to inspire and guide professional learning opportunities at all levels of mathematics education.,18,Books and Products

23,Books and Products,Connecting mathematics education research to classroom practice is a challenge that is addressed in this book. ,23,Books and Products
24,Books and Products,"Using the eight Mathematics Teaching Practices and the five Essential Elements from Principles to Actions as the framework, each chapter of the book clearly addresses this connection. Examples of how the research related to each of the eight math teaching practices and five essential elements is connected to classroom teaching practice are provided by sharing vignettes and sample tasks as well as through the voice of classroom teachers. This is one of the many strengths of this book. Each chapter is written by a team of authors consisting of mathematics education researchers and classroom teachers. Many mathematics educators face a new challenge of encouraging their students to reach higher levels of expectations with more rigorous standards, including the Standards for Mathematical Practices. It is often a challenge for teachers to create a vision of a student-centered  classroom situation in which students are actively engaged and productively struggling with tasks of high cognitive demand. This book meets its promise of providing the reader with the “fl avor” of what each teaching practice and essential element looks like in a real classroom, and it gives the research support for why these practices and elements are important. This book could appeal to a wide  audience: teachers, administrators, coaches, parents, teacher educators, professional developers, and school board members would all benefi t from connecting the research behind the math teaching practices to effective classroom practice. I highly recommend this book.",24,Books and Products

31,Books and Products,"Mathematics Formative Assessment, Volume 2 is a compilation of practical strategies for assessing mathematical understanding in students of all  grade levels. The authors, Page Keeley and Cheryl Rose Tobey, build on the 75 strategies in volume 1 by offering 50 additional strategies. The fi rst two chapters of this volume provide a brief overview of formative assessment and its inextricable link to instruction and learning. The remainder of the volume is dedicated to the 50 formative assessment classroom techniques or, as the authors call them, FACTs. Each FACT is succinctly described, and an example of how the FACT can be applied to a specifi c area of the mathematics curriculum is provided. When applicable, modifi cations and ideas for implementation are suggested. ",31,Books and Products
32,Books and Products,"Strengths include FACTs, which assess attitudes and dispositions in addition to content and practices. The authors’ suggestions for implementation are also useful. For example, they advise trying just one FACT at a time. If too many ideas are tried at one time, it can be overwhelming for both teachers and students. The FACTs are presented in  alphabetical order, and tables show how they link to mathematical practices and the grade level and content domain of each FACT example. Although no single organizational system is perfect, I found the alphabetical organization diffi cult. To fi nd a FACT, one must remember what the authors named it. Since not all the names are obvious, this can be problematic. ",32,Books and Products
33,Books and Products,"Over all, I highly recommend  this book to anyone teaching mathematics. It offers extremely useful ideas for infusing formative assessment into instruction, and it has inspired me to purchase volume 1 in the series. ",33,Books and Products

40,Books and Products,"This slender volume was compiled as a resource for mathematics education researchers and psychometricians, particularly those from each community who are interested in collaborating. At the risk of being simplistic, I would defi ne psychometric methods as those that use various mathematical models and statistical methods to measure knowledge, cognitive abilities, learning, and other mental attributes. This book is intended neither to introduce psychometric methods to the reader nor to provide the reader with technical knowledge necessary to design and conduct research using psychometric methods. Rather, it offers a well-written and carefully crafted collection of chapters that present illustrations of a variety of psychometric models and their uses within mathematics education research. ",40,Books and Products
41,Books and Products,"For researchers and psychometricians, this book could be a valuable resource for thinking about whether and how psychometric models can be useful for exploring certain kinds of questions about student ability and development. The book presupposes that the reader is interested in conducting research on mathematical ability or mathematical thinking; it is clearly not intended for use by the general public or by the typical classroom teacher. ",41,Books and Products
42,Books and Products,"Nevertheless, the monograph may be appealing to mathematics teachers who are already familiar with basic concepts relating to psychometrics and who are interested in knowing more about varied ways that student ability and learning are modeled and assessed in education research.",42,Books and Products

150,Books and Products,"Gallery of the Inﬁ nite is a book creatively written to explore infi nity. The concepts are diffi cult but the colorful pictures and relatively few  words make it accessible for curious middle-level students and beyond. At fi rst glance, it looks like this book is a quick read, but do not be fooled. Once you begin reading, you will continue to go back and forth, rereading to make the connections. ",150,Books and Products
151,Books and Products,"The colorful pictures and the  conversational tone used by the author to tell the story of sets and infi nity are some of the strengths of this book. The informal writing style makes you feel as though you are having a conversation rather than reading a math book. Although the content in the book is well beyond the level of middle school students, this book sparks interest through the creative presentation, which might draw in students who are curious about the topic of infi nity.
