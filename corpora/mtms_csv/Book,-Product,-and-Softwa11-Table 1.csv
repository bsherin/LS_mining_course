Foreword by Neale Godfrey. 128 pp., $29.95 paper. ISBN 978â€‘0â€‘87353â€‘729â€‘2. Stock no. 14534. National Council of Teachers of Mathematics; http://www.nctm.org.",,
5,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (May 2016) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","On the Money: Math Activities to Build Financial Literacy, Grades 6â€“8 provides middle school teachers a way to help students understand mathematical concepts with real-world applications while teaching financial literacy, an important skill beneficial for students as future consumers. Each chapter includes Common Core State Standards for Mathematics and a lesson plan for including financial knowledge that is relevant to middle school students, such as saving for college, buying a car, or understanding a percentage off sales. Activities provided for each chapter are easy to understand and provide ample questions for critical thinking and class discussion.",,
6,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (May 2016) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","The chapters are written to assist the teacher with questions to ask for individual, small-group, and whole-class discourse. The end of each chapter includes websites that can be used as additional resources or where students can play games while learning more about finances. The authors refer to these extension lessons as â€œGrowth Opportunities.â€ Teachers should double-check before presenting the websites to their students because a small number of the addresses are inaccurate. When teachers use this book to provide real-world applications to satisfy the mathematical standards, students will learn how finances can affect their lives. The more students can learn about money and how it affects their lives, the better consumers they will be. They will also better understand how mathematics touches their lives.",,

13,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (May 2016) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Advanced Common Core Math Explorations: Numbers & Operations by Jerry Burkhart contains a nice variety of explorations that focus on helping students improve their understanding of numbers and operations. The explorations are in the text, with each one beginning with an Introduction, followed by Student Handout pages, and then a Teacherâ€™s Guide.",,
14,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (May 2016) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","The Introduction outlines what prior knowledge students should have to do the activity, the learning goals, and any materials that are necessary to do the exploration. It also provides suggestions for launching the exploration. The exploration in the Student Handout may take students two or three days or up to a week to complete, depending on their background knowledge. The Teacherâ€™s Guide is very useful, since it provides not only solutions but also many teacher notes and suggested questions to ask that encourage class discussion. A table both at the beginning and ending of the text indicates how the activities are aligned with the Common Coreâ€™s math standards.",,
15,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (May 2016) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","I used an exploration called Torran Math with my preservice elementary teachers. It provided a nice introduction to working with a different number base (base 4). Students were introduced to the exploration by pretending that they were part of an expedition to the planet Torr. Students had to not only write numbers in base 4 but also represent the numbers using drawings of base 4 blocks, which provided a good connection to using base 10 blocks. The students found the activity challenging but worthwhile, and it helped them to better understand their own base 10 numeration system.",,
16,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (May 2016) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","The downfall of the text layout is that the Teacherâ€™s Guide follows the Student Handout pages, so the text cannot be used as a workbook. It would be helpful if the book included a CD with ready-to-print activities for the students rather than having to photocopy pages from the text. Despite the inconvenience of not having the Student Handouts readily available for duplicating, the activities are worthwhile for students. The connections to the Common Coreâ€™s math standards make this book a valuable resource for mathematics teacher educators, middle school teachers, and preservice teachers.",,

22,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (May 2016) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","This book alerts in-service and preservice teachers to some misconceptions that students have in arithmetic and beginning algebra. Each misconception is addressed over two to three pages, giving the grade range, a sample question, likely student answers, explanations of the misconception, what teachers can do, and a research note. Although misconceptions range from Kâ€“grade 12, most target upper elementary and middle school.",,
23,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (May 2016) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","With few exceptions, each topic is addressed accurately, but some descriptions are awkward. For example, in the chapter â€œMisconception 21: Comparing Negative Numbers,â€ the misconception is that â€“12 is greater than â€“6. The explanation begins thus: â€œThis student is thinking in the realm of absolute value of numbers and therefore lacks knowledge of number density. This is a structural error of conceptual understanding. . . .â€ Although the student is obviously comparing absolute values to conclude that â€“12 is greater, that does not implicate number density.",,
24,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (May 2016) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","This book would be best used in undergraduate or masterâ€™s level teacher education courses that specifically address learning mathematics. Since the topics in the book do not follow a grade or topical order, it is not necessary to follow the book from beginning to end. The descriptions of what teachers can do are useful and straightforward, and they discuss various ways for students to understand the concept of an algorithm. The research notes are useful summaries of research that has been conducted concerning each misconception; this research can be used as a platform for further investigation.",,

30,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (May 2016) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","Number Treasury3 is an expanded and updated version of Number Treasury2. It is a fascinating collection of more than 125 activities and investigations that would appeal to anyone interested in exploring mathematics. The book presents activities covering a wide variety of mathematical topics, such as Perfect Numbers, Abundant Numbers, Amicable Numbers, Pythagorean Triples, Cubic Numbers, and Palindromic Numbers. It also explores such lesser-known curiosities as Semiperfect Numbers, Weird Abundant Numbers, Happy Numbers, Snowball Primes, Narcissistic Numbers, and Lucas Numbers.",,
31,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (May 2016) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics","The activities and investigations have various levels of difficulty. Some, such as Marble Art, includes hands-on activity to show how polyhedral numbers can be represented physically. Others, such as working with Lucky Numbers, require more abstract reasoning. Solutions to the investigations are included in the back of the book, along with a glossary, recommended readings, and online resources. Very brief historical notes are also included.",,
32,"Book, Product, and Software Reviews (May 2016) - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics",This book is a great choice for teachers as well as students who are interested in either recreational mathematics or in studying interesting number patterns. The activities can easily be used in both middle and secondary mathematics classrooms as enrichment topics. They would also be appropriate for use in math clubs and to challenge advanced learners. I highly recommend this book for anyone who loves exploring interesting properties of numbers.,,
