See how a class of sixth graders used concrete and pictorial models to build meaning for arithmetic operations with fractions.,5,mtms2010-02-338a,,
"sixth or seventh grade with this rule. We examined current commercial curricula and found that few textbooks use context as a way to build meaning for the division of fractions. When context  is used, the connection between the invert-and-multiply rule and the context is superficial at best. ",6,mtms2010-02-338a,,
"Textbooks often use illustrations as a form of representation to build meaning. However, the transition from these pictures to the symbolic rule occurs quickly. In so doing, students may be getting an inadequate understanding of fraction division. ",7,mtms2010-02-338a,,
"One way that textbooks show division with fractions is by providing a picture for a single problem, such as 3 ÷ 1/2. In this case, students would be shown three rectangles, each divided in half, so that the solution of 6 is recognized (see fig. 1a). The invert-andmultiply algorithm is presented after this one example. It is likely that the pictures will appear once or twice in the practice set following the example.",8,mtms2010-02-338a,,
Another common textbook method is exemplified by the example of ,9,mtms2010-02-338a,,
"A rectangle is divided into nine pieces, eight of which are shaded to represent 8/9 (see fig. 1b). The caption, or explanation, in the book would group the sections two at a time, into four portions, yielding the result. The symbolic representation and algorithm of the example follows (in fig. 1c). Each of these examples demonstrates a quick transition to a symbolic rule.",10,mtms2010-02-338a,,
Our approach differs from the way that fraction division is introduced in  traditional curricula. We presented fraction division as a problem-solving opportunity for students. Students constructed their own strategies that relied on pictures. Their strategies and pictures reflected their understanding of the part-whole model for fractions and their ability to name fractional parts when the unit changed. The story problems we used were based on a measurement model for division. ,11,mtms2010-02-338a,,
Most textbooks tend to use a  measurement model for division (van de Walle 2007). Similar contexts can be used to write both measurement and partitive models. Consider the following two examples:,12,mtms2010-02-338a,,
Fig. 1 Fraction division is introduced in commercial middle school textbooks in a variety of ways.,13,mtms2010-02-338a,,
Three wholes divided into halves is a way to represent 3 ÷ 1/2.,14,mtms2010-02-338a,,
(a) ������������ (b) ������������  is shown by shading 8/9 and combining into four groups.,15,mtms2010-02-338a,,
The problem:,16,mtms2010-02-338a,,
Multiply by the reciprocal:,17,mtms2010-02-338a,,
"Multiply and simplify: (c)  1. Kay has an 8-gallon bag of soil for her garden plants. If each planter uses 2/3 gallon, how many planters can she fill?  2. Kay has an 8-gallon bag of soil for her 12 planters. How much soil will be in each planter?",18,mtms2010-02-338a,,
"The first problem is an example of a measurement model; students are given a set measure, 2/3 gallon, and they must determine how many groups of 2/3 gallon are in the 8-gallon bag of soil. The second problem is an example of a partitive model, because students know the number of groups and are determining the amount in each group.",19,mtms2010-02-338a,,
"We chose to use a measurement model because we anticipated that it would give sixth-grade students an opportunity to solve fraction division problems using pictures. In so doing, this choice would support the common-denominator procedure for fraction division. Since these students had already learned to use common denominators to add and subtract fractions, the measurement model for fraction division gave them another opportunity to see how common denominators can be used when operating with fractions. ",20,mtms2010-02-338a,,
We acknowledge that this four- day problem-solving experience represents students’ initial entry into division with fractions. Future instruction should include the partitive model so that it can support their construction of the invert-and- multiply procedure.,21,mtms2010-02-338a,,
"The numbers in the story problems varied; they included a whole number divided by a fraction, division of two fractions, and answers with and without remainders. The strategies that students constructed built  meaning for dividing fractions using a common-denominator approach.",22,mtms2010-02-338a,,
"Fig. 2 Students see that each circle piece can be named in more than one way,  depending on what unit is used.",23,mtms2010-02-338a,,
students’ Background,24,mtms2010-02-338a,,
"To better understand why students were able to construct their own strategies for solving division problems using fractions, we share some background on what happened before students worked with division. These sixth graders first completed a fourlesson review of fractions. They used fraction circles and paper folding to reinforce their understanding of part to whole. The lessons emphasized the importance of identifying the unit when naming fractions. ",25,mtms2010-02-338a,,
"An early activity used the representations shown in figure 2. Students named fraction-circle pieces in many ways: the blue piece was 1/4 when the black circle was the unit and 1/2 when the yellow piece was the unit. The red piece was 1/12 when the black circle was the unit, 1/6 when the yellow piece was the unit, and 1/3 when the blue onefourth piece was the unit. The purpose of this activity is to reinforce the part-whole construct for fractions and help students understand the important role that the unit plays in naming a fractional amount. ",26,mtms2010-02-338a,,
Students see that each piece of the circle can be named in more than one way depending on what is stated as the unit. Understanding the role of the unit is critical when using pictures to divide fractions. Readers will see how this idea plays out later in fraction division when examining student work. Reviewing this representation also supported students’ construction of informal ordering ideas and reinforced the meaning of equivalence.,27,mtms2010-02-338a,,
"Students then participated in a  series of twenty-eight lessons on fractions to build meaning and procedural skill when using decimals as well as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Using concrete ",28,mtms2010-02-338a,,

"Green 15 pieces and pictorial models and real-world contexts helped build meaning. They also made sense of the symbolic procedures by making connections between the models and the steps of the algorithms. The models included fraction circles, paper folding, pictures of rectangles and circles, and the number line. The last four lessons introduced students to fraction division.  diVision using Whole nuMBers",35,mtms2010-02-338a,,
We launched the lessons using this measurement-division story problem with whole numbers:    Addis is a baker. She bought  50 pounds of flour. How  many 5-pound containers  can she fill?,36,mtms2010-02-338a,,
Students were asked to imagine how they would solve this problem. ,37,mtms2010-02-338a,,
We wanted students to connect this measurement problem to the question of “How many groups of 5 pounds are in 50 pounds?” and to the division sentence 50 ÷ 5 = 10. This problem set the stage for students to transfer their understanding of measurement story problems with whole numbers to situations involving fractions. ,38,mtms2010-02-338a,,
"Students were asked to work in  groups to solve three story problems (see fig. 3). Group work was followed by a class discussion in which groups’ solution strategies were presented. Before reading through examples of students’ solutions, solve each problem using pictures instead of the algorithm you may have used in the past.",39,mtms2010-02-338a,,

"Figure 4 show three students’  solutions. In (a), April constructed a double number line. Before the start of the division lessons, students used number lines to solve fraction multiplication tasks. Several students constructed double number lines when modeling fraction multiplication and transferred this approach to situations involving division. ",44,mtms2010-02-338a,,
"April labeled the number line in two ways to make sense of the problem. The numbers 1, 2, and 3 that are underneath the line represent the 3 cups of bird seed. After partitioning each of the three units into fourths, April counted out a group of 3/4 and labeled it 1; she counted another 3/4 and labeled it 2; and so on. The numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 above the line represented the number ",45,mtms2010-02-338a,,

India drew 3 rectangles to represent  the 3 scoops of bird seed (see fig. 4b). She partitioned each rectangle into fourths and shaded 3/4 of each rectangle to make “3 groups of 3/4.” She combined the three remaining fourths in each rectangle to create one more scoop.,51,mtms2010-02-338a,,
"Xander drew the picture shown in  figure 4c on an overhead-projector  transparency as he shared his solution with the other students. He drew 3 circles to represent the 3 cups of bird seed that the bird feeder could hold. He partitioned each cup into fourths and counted out groups of 3/4 by naming the first 3/4 group 1, 1, 1; the second 3/4 group 2, 2, 2; and so on. What these three solutions have in common are a picture that represents the initial amount being divided, a partitioning of the picture into fourths, and a system to keep track of ",52,mtms2010-02-338a,,

"1. Kia has 2 1/4 pounds of peppermint candies. She wants to put them in small bags, each about 1/8 pound. how many small bags of candies can she make? 2. What if Kia had only 6/8 pound of peppermint candies and she makes small bags, each about 1/4 pound. how many small bags of candies can she make? (a) the groups of 3/4 being removed from that amount. Each picture models a solution to the question “How many 3/4 are in 3?” and demonstrates division as repeated subtraction.",56,mtms2010-02-338a,,
"Most of the students’ initial solution strategies involved drawing pictures similar to those made by April, India, and Xander. We did notice that a few students constructed a different picture strategy. ",57,mtms2010-02-338a,,
The story problem in figure 5 was part of students’ homework. Haley’s solution demonstrates an alternative picture solution. She did not start with a picture of the 3 cups of candy hearts: Her picture represented 1/3 cup put into each bag. She kept drawing pictures of 1/3 until she reached 3 cups. Although she answered the question “How many 1/3 are in 3?” her thinking involved adding groups of 1/3 to reach 3 as opposed to the three previous solutions in which students took away groups of 3/4 from 3.,58,mtms2010-02-338a,,
"Students who used this counting-up  strategy made errors because, in some cases, they did not know when to stop counting or when they reached the total amount. During the class presentations of students’ solutions, we discussed the two different ways to draw pictures. We reached consensus that solving the divi- (b) sion tasks as illustrated by April, India, and Xander was easier to understand. We reinforced this strategy in subsequent lessons by giving students the story problem and an initial picture to use to solve the problem. ",59,mtms2010-02-338a,,
"Two sample problems in which the initial picture was provided are shown in figure 6. In (a), the student partitioned each whole into groups of 1/8 and shaded 2 1/4 so that she could easily count out groups of 1/8 that were in 2 1/4. In (b), the original picture given to the students was partitioned into eighths. To count out fourths, students needed to change the picture to 3/4 to see that three groups of 1/4 can be removed from 6/8. We varied the numbers in the problems so at times students needed to increase the number of partitions; at other times, students would need to eliminate some of the partitions.",60,mtms2010-02-338a,,
"Students’ solutions were similar in that they looked for a way to change the picture so that each number in the fraction division task had the same denominator. Students were  able to do this intuitively, without direct instruction. When solving 3 ÷ 3/4, they changed the picture to show twelve-fourths and then identified groups of three-fourths. When students solved 2 1/4 ÷ 1/8, their picture became 18/8 ÷ 1/8. And when solving 6/8 ÷ 1/4, the picture was 3/4 ÷ 1/4. Using pictures, students constructed a common-denominator procedure for fraction division. This connection between their picture solutions using common denominators and the symbolic procedure using common denominators was brought up later in the lessons. It is significant that this alternative algorithm to invert and multiply was constructed by students themselves as they solved measurement division story problems with fractions and involved limited direct instruction from the teacher.",61,mtms2010-02-338a,,

division problems with remainders?,66,mtms2010-02-338a,,
"Before examining these examples of students’ thinking, work through the problem in figure 7a that we used to initiate our discussion on labeling the remainder. Estimate first. Do you think you will have at least 3 servings? Could you get 6 servings?",67,mtms2010-02-338a,,
We invited students to come to  the front of the class and share their drawings and explanations. Scout drew circles for the 3 pounds of fish and partitioned each circle into thirds (see fig. 7a). She used different colors to designate each serving. She pointed to the 1 piece left over and commented that it was 1/3 of the whole circle. She also stated and recorded that the  serving size was 2/3 and renamed the amount left over as 1/2 of a serving. Her final answer was 4 1/2 servings.,68,mtms2010-02-338a,,
Determining the unit is critical  when using pictures to solve fraction division problems with remainders. Our students had many experiences naming fractions in which the unit varied (see fig. 2). They understood that a fraction amount represented by a concrete model or picture has meaning only if they know the unit. They realized that this amount could be named in more than one way; it all depended on the unit. Understanding that an amount can be named in more than one way is critical to making sense of fraction division with remainders. ,69,mtms2010-02-338a,,
Not all students in the class agreed right away that the answer should be named 4 1/2 servings. Some argued that it should be 4 1/3 servings. A lively discussion among class members led most students to realize that the remainder needed to be named by comparing it with the serving size and not the whole circle (1 pound of fish) that Scout drew.,70,mtms2010-02-338a,,
"Figure 7b lists the problem and shows Ty’s picture that he presented to the class. Ty used squares to represent 2 1/2 pounds.

"Ty’s squared-off sizes  verbalize. At this point, we did not ask students to generalize the commondenominator algorithm, although some students did observe that you could just divide the numerators once you rewrote the sentence with common denominators. They reasoned that to evaluate 12/4 ÷ 3/4, they have to determine the number of groups of 3 pieces (of size 1/4) that are in a set of 12 pieces of the same size. As this was only a series of four lessons, we did not set as our goal the generalization of the common-denominator algorithm with symbols. For most of these sixth-grade students, solving fraction division still involved first drawing pictures and then attaching the number sentence as an added connection.  student errors",75,mtms2010-02-338a,,
"What were some common errors that students made as they worked through fraction division? We  describe two examples, which are  shown in figure 9a and 9b.",76,mtms2010-02-338a,,
"One error involved Joey’s work (see fig. 9a). He knew that the answer was 3 when looking at the picture. However, when he recorded the number sentence, he wrote 3/4. Because the problem involved fractions, many students, including Joey, may have erroneously felt that the answer should be a fraction even though the picture represented a whole-number solution. ",77,mtms2010-02-338a,,
"It is also possible that these students may have been taught to label their answers; therefore, they would have written 3/4 instead of 3 because they viewed the fourths as the “label.” To overcome this error, we asked students to state aloud the answer to the question embedded in the story problem. For example, students explained the answer to the question “How many 3/4 are in 3?” by saying, “I took out 4 groups of 3/4 in 3” or “There are 4 groups of 3/4 in 3.”  ",78,mtms2010-02-338a,,

He explained that the one part left over is 1/3 of the serving size.,80,mtms2010-02-338a,,
"The next step was to guide students to translate their actions with pictures to symbols. This is a critical transition. We believed that when students were able to verbally describe the steps they took to solve the problem using pictures, they were ready to record those steps with symbols. We asked students to reflect on  their pictured solutions and to describe verbally what they did. We guided this discussion by asking them to find the original number sentence for the problems and describe how they changed the picture to solve the problem. Students then recorded the action of changing the drawing into a number sentence that had common denominators. A story problem that can be  represented symbolically with the number sentence 4 ÷ 2/3 is shown in figure 8. To solve the problem, the student partitioned four wholes into thirds to make it easier to count out groups of 2/3. The original number sentence represents the picture before the partitioning; the second number sentence represents the change in the picture that makes it possible to count out groups of 2/3.",81,mtms2010-02-338a,,

In the first few fraction division lessons, we asked students to record the division sentence for the story problem. We did not ask them to rewrite the number sentence with common denominators. Some students were unsure how to write the division sentence. Hazel could solve the problem with a picture and write a sentence to describe what she did but did not know how to record these actions using a division number sentence. She wrote 1/2 ÷ 5 = 10 instead of 5 ÷ 1/2 =10. This error created an opportunity for a class discussion on how to write division sentences.",90,mtms2010-02-338a,,

"The part-whole model for fractions helps students understand the use of rational numbers (English and Halford 1995). Although it is important for middle school students to expand their interpretation of fractions to other constructs (operator, ratio, quotient, and measurement), the part-whole model is a crucial gateway to making sense of rational numbers (Lamon 2007). These sixth-grade students’ extended use of concrete and pictorial models provided them with a deep understanding of the partwhole model that in turn supported their construction of a procedure for dividing fractions. This initial fraction interpretation supported students’ understanding of a more complex idea: how to divide fractions.",92,mtms2010-02-338a,,
"Students’ understanding of the  part-whole model went beyond naming and representing pictures and concrete models using fraction symbols. Our students’ understanding of the part-whole construct was strongly  tied to the idea of “flexibility of unit.” Early in their exposure to naming and representing fractions, students were asked to reflect on the unit. The idea that a certain piece of a fraction circle could be named in multiple ways depending on the unit is a fundamental idea tied to the part-whole model. Our students have many experiences reinforcing this idea; this is not the case in traditional curricula.",93,mtms2010-02-338a,,
"Our students’ understanding of  fraction division is closely tied to their actions with pictures. Helping students make the connection between symbolic procedures and the actions they perform with concrete or pictorial models can enhance their understanding of a procedure (English and Halford 1995). In this case, meaning for the symbolic procedure is developed from students’ initial actions with pictorial models. There is a strong connection between actions on the pictures and steps to the common denominator algorithm. Students constructed the common-denominator strategy for fraction division by solving a measurement story with pictures, with some guidance from the teacher. Instructional activities linked their pictorial strategy to an abstract one.",94,mtms2010-02-338a,,

"In future lessons, students should  be given story problems involving partitive division. These types of problems and experiences can be used to help students develop meaning for the invert-and-multiply algorithm.
