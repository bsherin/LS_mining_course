"Procedures through sense Making tThe Common Core State Standards  for Mathematics (CCSSM) articulate standards for both content and mathematical practices, stating that the practices are essential to developing and demonstrating mathematical understanding. For example, the document states that a “hallmark of mathematical understanding is the ability to justify . . . why a particular mathematical statement is true or where a mathematical rule comes from” (CCSSI 2010, p. 4). The eight mathematical practices explored in  the Common Core Math Standards  (pp. 6-8) are the following:  1.  Make sense of problems and   persevere in solving them.",2,mtms2012-04-552a,,
2.  Reason abstractly and quantitatively.,3,mtms2012-04-552a,,
3.  Construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others.,4,mtms2012-04-552a,,
"Allowing students to  reason and communicate about integer operations, or any idea, before these ideas  are formalized can be an important tool for fostering  deep understanding.",5,mtms2012-04-552a,,

"What do these practices look like in classrooms, and how do they help students learn in specific mathematical domains? We suggest that the practices are the “core” of the Common Core Math Standards because without them, students will not develop the kind of mathematical understanding necessary to succeed in a global economy. The following series of episodes from the same classroom illustrate the role that many of these practices played in helping students reason about integer addition and subtraction. We selected integer  computation because it is listed in the Common Core Math Standards as an important middle school topic.",12,mtms2012-04-552a,,
"We focus on a series of eight  eighty-minute block class sessions in which students engaged with a sequence of tasks from the Connected Mathematics Project (CMP) curriculum. These tasks allowed students to informally reason about integer operations before developing more formal and conventional ways of computing with them, a process called progressive formalization (NRC 2001). Research in cognition suggests that it is critical for students to play around with ideas before formal versions are introduced. When formalization is introduced too early, it interferes with the development of students’ conceptual understanding (Pesek and Kirshner 2000). The episodes described below show how progressive formalization is linked to the mathematical practices emphasized in the Common Core Math Standards. ",13,mtms2012-04-552a,,
"The teacher, Ms. Granville, had  used these tasks for several years and had developed an understanding of how they helped students reason about integer operations. Furthermore, her discourse practices provided opportunities for students to engage in— •	 reasoning	abstractly	and	  quantitatively; •	 constructing	viable	arguments;	and •	 critiquing	the	reasoning	of	others.",14,mtms2012-04-552a,,
"As will be seen, she typically pressed students to explain their thinking and often asked students to paraphrase peers’ explanations. As a result, her students frequently volunteered explanations and commented on the ways that their peers reasoned about mathematics. The teacher played an important role in orchestrating the discussions, clarifying explanations, and emphasizing key points. How- ever, she refrained from emphasizing concepts or procedures before students had opportunities to think about them. ",15,mtms2012-04-552a,,
Fig. 1 These early conjectures about  operations with negative numbers  developed into an understanding in  later lessons.,16,mtms2012-04-552a,,
daY 1: deFining  nuMber sYsteMs,17,mtms2012-04-552a,,
The students discussed number systems so that they could think about the differences between integers and other types of numbers with which they were already familiar. The teacher emphasized what it meant for a number to have a negative value.  daY 2: initial conjectures,18,mtms2012-04-552a,,
"The students worked on a task called Math Fever, set in a game-show context, in which teams won or lost points on the basis of answering questions correctly. The point allocations were 50, 100, 150, 200, or 250. Students were asked to generate number sentences for various point totals. These number sentences differed according to whether students used addition or subtraction to represent a loss of points. This varied thinking led to discussions in which students articulated draft or preliminary forms of reasoning about properties of integer computation. Students’ formative conjectures served as precursors to more refined and coherent statements about properties and procedures that they later developed (see fig. 1).",19,mtms2012-04-552a,,
"Granville encouraged students  early in the instructional sequence to communicate their formative ideas. These ideas gave her information about her teaching and later became objects of collective reflection, leading to more refined conjectures and critiques of those conjectures. Furthermore, these conjectures showed that students were playing around with key concepts (e.g., a number’s distance from zero) and procedures (e.g., connections between addition and subtraction with respect to integers). Later in the same class session,  adding something that is a  negative number: When you add it, you’re actually subtracting, you’re just putting a negative in front of a number that would have been added, and when you add it with a negative, then you would just subtract from that number.  — Aaron if you subtract two negative  numbers, you are going to add because with a negative number, instead of subtracting, you’re also subtracting again, because you’re using a negative number, so then you’re actually adding.",20,mtms2012-04-552a,,
"— Maya if you have a positive number, more than the number you’re subtracting, you would not say “minus negative” because the number you’re subtracting is less than the number you have before. Therefore, if you subtracted it, you would still have a positive number. — Josh",21,mtms2012-04-552a,,
"When you do an equation with negative numbers, rather than thinking of it as the number you want to add, think of it as a space between the negative number and zero.  — Jarrayl students continued to reason about integers, arguing what it meant for a negative integer to be smaller: ",22,mtms2012-04-552a,,
Hugh: The smaller number is closer  to 0.,23,mtms2012-04-552a,,
Granville: Is that always true? When is the smaller number closer to 0?,24,mtms2012-04-552a,,
George: When you’re using a positive  number.,25,mtms2012-04-552a,,
Granville: Is the smallest number  closest to 0 for negative integers?,26,mtms2012-04-552a,,
"Lillian: Yeah, the smaller number is  closest to 0.",27,mtms2012-04-552a,,
Sarah: It’s the furthest away from 0.,28,mtms2012-04-552a,,
Lillian: I’m saying -1 is a small  number.,29,mtms2012-04-552a,,
Sarah: And -500 is smaller. ,30,mtms2012-04-552a,,
"Granville noted that students’ prior  experiences with positive numbers created problems when students began to talk about the size of integers; consequently, she emphasized the importance of helping students refine their language, as shown above when she pressed students on what “smaller” meant in the context of integers.",31,mtms2012-04-552a,,
daY 3: considering teMPerature,32,mtms2012-04-552a,,
"Students thought about integer addition and subtraction in contexts involving temperature, connecting the operations to movements on the number line. The class discussed a task in which students were given a low temperature (-8°C) and a halfway temperature (5°C) and asked to find the high temperature. Granville used a horizontal number line to illustrate a student’s explanation. The student explained that from “-8 to 0 is 8, and then it takes 5 more to get to 5 degrees, so total [distance] is 13.” Granville drew arcs on a number line to represent the 13-unit gap between -8 and 5, and then she drew another 13-unit gap to show how the student had added 13 to 5 to get 18, the high temperature. Similarly, Granville showed the connection between subtraction and addition by asking students to explain the action on the number line for computing 8 + -7. Several students stated that adding -7 required a movement to the left on the number line, which they observed was equivalent to subtracting 7.",33,mtms2012-04-552a,,
daY 4: using colored chiPs,34,mtms2012-04-552a,,
"Granville introduced the chipboard model as an additional tool that  students could use to understand and justify integer computations. She placed 6 red and 4 black chips on the board to represent -6 + 4 and explained that each pair of red and black chips was equivalent to 0. She noted that although 10 chips were on the board, the total value was -2. Students generated other chipboard diagrams that resulted in a value of -2, which Granville translated to number sentences using an overhead projector. ",35,mtms2012-04-552a,,
"The next tasks involved generating number sentences from actions on the chipboard. Granville began with  2 red chips and 1 black chip and asked, “How can we subtract 3 red chips?” This action required adding another red-black pair, recognizing that the action was equivalent to adding 0. She then explained that the number sentence for that action would be -1 – (-3) = 2. Granville emphasized the connection between number sentences and actions on the chipboard, noting that students in prior years tended to move chips without understanding the operation they were representing. During the final task of the day, she asked what actions were possible for a scenario that began with 6 red chips and ended with 2 red chips. The possibilities—one could add 4 black chips or subtract 4 red chips—helped to further establish the connection between integer addition and subtraction.  daY 5: reFining conjectures",36,mtms2012-04-552a,,
"The class discussed a warm-up problem in which students determined the net change in altitude of an airplane that descended 140 feet and then rose 112 feet. Granville posted -140 + 112 = -28, a number sentence produced by a student, on the board. She asked the class to comment on it, which led to the following exchange: ",37,mtms2012-04-552a,,
She refrained  from emphasizing  concepts or procedures  before students had opportunities to think  about them.,38,mtms2012-04-552a,,
"Sarah: I think she did 140 - 112 be- cause you can’t really add 140 + 112 to get -28. I knew you’d get -28 because -140 is more than 112, so it would have to be in the negatives.",39,mtms2012-04-552a,,
Laura: I was just thinking you could see which one is bigger. You could take away the negative sign and then put it back because that one was bigger if it didn’t have the negative sign.,40,mtms2012-04-552a,,
"Both students discussed the relative  sizes of 140 and 112, to describe why the result would be negative, by intuitively describing which number had a greater absolute value. Laura described how she could “take away” the negative sign and then put it back. This conversation shows how students were wrestling with the concept of absolute value and its role in integer addition and subtraction. Granville resisted formalizing absolute value at that time because she knew that the next tasks would provide additional opportunities for students to refine their reasoning. ",41,mtms2012-04-552a,,
The same number sentence was  revisited when a student described the rules that he thought were evident: ,42,mtms2012-04-552a,,
Thomas: You can switch the two signs  around. ,43,mtms2012-04-552a,,
"Granville: Now, be careful, because  that’s actually not what Sarah said. She didn’t switch the two signs around. What did you do, Sarah?",44,mtms2012-04-552a,,
Sarah: I just took off the negative off  the 140. ,45,mtms2012-04-552a,,
These  algorithms were the product of two  weeks of reasoning and conjecturing around the  concepts related to  explanations. The conversation continued: ,46,mtms2012-04-552a,,
"Sarah: The way that I knew that it was a negative was because let’s just say that the negative was 100. And it was 112 for the positive, and you had to add those two numbers. I would know not to put a negative sign on that.  integers.",47,mtms2012-04-552a,,
"Granville: Took off the sign temporarily. [She wrote, “Took off sign temporarily.”] And then you subtracted? [She wrote “subtracted” next to the vertical algorithm.]",48,mtms2012-04-552a,,
Sarah: Yeah.,49,mtms2012-04-552a,,
"Allen: About what Sarah did: She  used the opposite number. Instead of -140 + 112, she did 140 - 112, which gave her the opposite of the answer.",50,mtms2012-04-552a,,
"Granville emphasized the importance of having students communicate their thinking and having other students make sense of that thinking. She stated, “I like the idea of taking kids’ own words and language and other kids trying to make sense of it.” To facilitate this process, she often recorded key steps of students’ explanations, as she did above. ",51,mtms2012-04-552a,,
"Thomas’s incorrect generalization led to separate explanations of how to carry out the computation that reiterated the prior notion of removing the sign and then replacing it. Another explanation aligned with Thomas’s assertion, in which Allen applied the notion of “opposite” to the placement and signs of the numbers in the vertical algorithm, which would lead to the opposite of the correct answer.",52,mtms2012-04-552a,,
"Students were wrestling with not only language but also the kinds of rules that apply to integer computation. In the process, they were also evaluating and critiquing one another’s ",53,mtms2012-04-552a,,
"Granville: Okay, -100 + 112. [She wrote  this sentence in a different color above the original number sentence.]",54,mtms2012-04-552a,,
"Sarah: I would know not to put a negative sign on the end of the problem when I got my answer because if you take away the positive and negative signs, 112 is more than 100, so you would know you would get a positive. The same thing with a negative. . . . You take away the negative and positive, 140 is more than 112.",55,mtms2012-04-552a,,
"Sarah provided new evidence—an  example that gave a similar result—that suggested that her rule had the potential to be generalized, which she showed by applying it to the original number sentence. Sarah’s explanation had evolved from when she first described the size of negative integers in terms of distance from zero, showing that she was developing more efficient reasoning with respect to integer computations.  daY 6: deFining  absolute value",56,mtms2012-04-552a,,
"Granville found an opportunity on day 6 to generate a definition for absolute value. The students worked on a warm-up problem in which they had to explain the sign of an integer addition or subtraction problem without referring to the actual calculation (e.g., determining the sign of -153 + 200). A student explained that the result was positive because “the positive [integer] is larger than the negative’s opposite, or it’s larger than the negative without the nega- tive.” This led Granville to prompt the class for a definition of absolute value, which students collectively decided was “a number’s distance from zero.” By waiting to emphasize this term until day 6, she provided multiple opportunities for students to understand why the idea of distance from zero was important to integer computation.  daY 7: arriving at algorithMs",57,mtms2012-04-552a,,
"The class discussed a number of conjectures that had developed around integer addition and subtraction. In these discussions, the students used the number line and chipboard models to justify or refute the conjectures. For example, one of the conjectures stated the following:  When you’re subtracting, you can just move the numbers toward zero instead of going right or left.",58,mtms2012-04-552a,,
"To refute the conjecture, a student used the chipboard to explain why the result of 10 – (-3) was farther from 0 than the original number, 10: ",59,mtms2012-04-552a,,
"Aaron: It’s 13, because the negative  numbers equal the red chips. That means when you’re subtracting, that means take away something, and negative equals red chips, and so that means, that means you’re taking away 3 red chips.",60,mtms2012-04-552a,,
"Teacher: But I don’t have any red  chips, so what am I going to have to put on my board?",61,mtms2012-04-552a,,
Aaron: Three of both [red and black]. ,62,mtms2012-04-552a,,
"And then you’re taking off . . . Teacher: Taking off the negatives  [removing 3 red chips on the diagram], and I’m left with . . . ",63,mtms2012-04-552a,,
Aaron: Thirteen black.  ,64,mtms2012-04-552a,,
"The discussion of this and other conjectures helped the students develop more formal algorithms. These algorithms were the product of two  weeks of continued reasoning and conjecturing around the concepts and properties related to integer computation. Such algorithms are typically given to students at the onset of an integer unit. Doing so, however, would have curtailed the opportunities these students would have had to solve problems, to reason quantitatively and abstractly, to use tools in appropriate ways to develop and justify conjectures, and to construct and evaluate explanations.  the iMPortance oF MatheMatical Practices",65,mtms2012-04-552a,,
"Why is it important for the students to engage in mathematical practices? In most middle school mathematics classrooms in the United States, rules and terminology are simply introduced and students are expected to memorize and master them (Stigler and Hiebert 1999). The conversations above, in the context of solving problems, showed that— 1.  students’ intuitive reasoning was conceptually linked to more abstract notions of absolute value; 2.  students sought patterns in  computations that helped them to make sense of algorithms; 3.  students used tools appropriately to develop and justify conjectures around operations; and 4.  students explained their thinking  and evaluated the thinking  of others. ",66,mtms2012-04-552a,,
"Furthermore, these practices were fundamental to how these students made sense of integer computation in ways that demonstrate flexible and possibly enduring understanding. It is unlikely that these students would have reasoned about integer computation to the same extent if they had been asked to simply memorize or apply rules. ",67,mtms2012-04-552a,,
"What was the role of the tasks in  which students engaged? The tasks were not particularly complex or difficult. Their primary qualities were that they provided opportunities for students to generate a variety of responses and that they appealed to students’ prior experiences and informal reasoning. The tasks, furthermore, provided repeated opportunities to reason about integer addition and subtraction, allowing for the concept of absolute value to emerge naturally from the conversations. ",68,mtms2012-04-552a,,
"What was the role of the teachers’ discourse practices? The teacher helped students revise and refine their reasoning by encouraging them to explain their thinking, by pressing them to clarify their explanations, and by asking others to comment on the explanations. She refrained from explaining concepts or introducing ideas before students had multiple opportunities to reason about them. She played a strong role, requiring careful attention to student reasoning and knowing when to seek clarification or input from students. She skillfully recognized and built on messy reasoning to help students develop abstract and quantitative reasoning. ",69,mtms2012-04-552a,,
Final coMMents,70,mtms2012-04-552a,,
"If we are going to take the Common Core Math Standards seriously, we need to think of them as more than simply a reordering of content. That means focusing on the practices they associate with mathematical understanding. A major implication is that developing practices rather than covering content requires a focus on task sequences rather than singular lessons; these sequences provide repeated opportunities for students to reason about ideas before they are formalized. ",71,mtms2012-04-552a,,
Most students can reason mathematically but few get the opportunity to publicly test ideas and conjectures as they are forming. Participation in such practices leads not only to increased understanding but also to the development of mathematical dispositions that are valuable as students move to more advanced mathematics (NRC 2001). ,72,mtms2012-04-552a,,
