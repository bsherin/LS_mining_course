0,Building a Positive Mathematics Community - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The ability of students to learn mathematics with understanding is strengthened by a positive school environment (Hiebert and Grouws 2007). Such an environment depends on a classroom ethos. Just as important is the entire school community, in which all students are expected to learn through active participation and all teachers are expected to engage all students in mathematical tasks.",,
1,Building a Positive Mathematics Community - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"The environment should be one in which students are actively involved in doing mathematics. Challenging problems should be posed, and the school environment should encourage students to work on them individually and in groups. Sometimes students will need to work for extended periods of time, and often they should encounter unfamiliar topics. These students should be encouraged to develop such traits and habits of mind as perseverance, cooperative work skills, reflection, self-assessment, self-confidence, decision making, and risk taking (Cuoco, Goldenberg, and Mark 1996; Goldenberg and Shteingold 2003). All these elements will be keys to their success in mathematics. This article recounts how one small urban school in northern New Jersey developed a school environment that created a positive mathematics culture.",,
2,Building a Positive Mathematics Community - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,I LOVE MATH DAY,,
3,Building a Positive Mathematics Community - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Every year, the school celebrates I Love Math Day on February 14. On this day, students enjoy math-related activities and recognize excellent student work after solving challenging problems. In the weeks leading up to the event-filled day, middle school students work in small teams to solve four intriguing, rich, mathematics problems. They are given one week to solve each problem and prepare a solution to submit to judges. Submissions can be in the form of an essay, a slide show, a video, a poster, a game, or a dramatization.",,
4,Building a Positive Mathematics Community - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Through an I Love Math blog, teachers encourage all school families to attempt to solve each problem together and join in the fun. They hope that parents and students in all grades will not only discuss and puzzle over these problems but also enjoy the pursuit of a solution together. In one classic problem, students were asked to create a visual demonstration of the Pythagorean theorem. Another problem was based on a centuries-old Middle Eastern story, which asked students to settle a family dispute over a bequest of camels.",,
5,Building a Positive Mathematics Community - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Another highlight of I Love Math Day is a panel discussion introducing two or three adult guests who love math. The panelists share their educational and professional experiences and discuss how mathematics contributes to their work and personal lives. Students in grades 6 through 8 are encouraged to ask questions during the panel discussion to guide the guests' comments.,,
6,Building a Positive Mathematics Community - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"When assembling a panel for the first time, it is usually best to keep it simple and organic. Parents in the school community are one of the best sources of panelists. It is fun to help students see that almost every adult uses math productively. Within our parent community, we have found cooks, bookkeepers, architects, and artists to serve on the panel. Sometimes parents speak about a leisure pastime that uses math: baseball and statistics, travel and foreign currencies. Grandparents work splendidly as math resources, as well. One grandparent was a carpenter, another was a retired teacher, and another was a judge. Almost any connection to mathematics can work. More creative connections lead to more inspiring events.",,
7,Building a Positive Mathematics Community - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"As I Love Math Day has become more established, we have broadened our reach to find panelists. Recently, one panelist was an associate professor of history who specializes in the history of mathematics education as well as women in science. She works with the Smithsonian Institution, cataloguing mathematical instruments for its website. Another panelist was the grandfather of several students who has taught at the middle school, high school, and college levels his entire career. He traveled 1500 miles to our school to share his passion for geometry, specializing in visual and reflective relationships. Paper folding, mirror applications, kaleidoscopes, and Platonic and Archimedean solids held particular interest for him. We have also invited alumni. One alumna had become an assistant editor for a medical journal. Another traveled from Texas, where he worked as an oil trader. Both shared stories about math in the workplace.",,
8,Building a Positive Mathematics Community - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Distinguished panelists such as these spend February 14 visiting classes, sharing their expertise and their passions, answering questions from the students, and celebrating the excellent work that students at all grade levels do in mathematics at the school.",,
9,Building a Positive Mathematics Community - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,HOW TEACHERS PREPARE THE ACTIVITIES,,
10,Building a Positive Mathematics Community - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Every year, the school searches out good problems that will challenge students and keep them interested and working hard for a week or more. Ideally, the problems require a creative use of middle school level mathematics ideas like factors, prime numbers, the Pythagorean theorem, squares, and square roots. The problems also prompt students to perform the fundamental tasks of all skilled mathematicians: ask questions; collaborate with peers; use appropriate resources; draw pictures; make models; and try, fail, and try again. Challenging problems are drawn from textbooks; articles; periodicals; current popular math books; and collections of problems, puzzles, comics, and cartoons. The 
  sidebar

  lists several excellent resources for problems.",,
11,Building a Positive Mathematics Community - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Students tackle these problems with relish. Sometimes the sixth graders are hesitant, unsure how to work in small groups on a problem that seems beyond their level of understanding. By eighth grade, those same students cannot wait to tackle each problem, figure out how to make some progress, and prepare a submission for the judges. Students understand that each problem will be demanding and will require persistence and creativity. They also know that they can discuss these problems with their parents and teachers. Internet research is permitted. Anything that mathematicians would do is encouraged. Of course, like good mathematicians, they cannot present the work of others as their own. If they receive help, the help should be acknowledged, and the students need to submit a solution that demonstrates their own mastery of the problem and the math concepts involved.",,
12,Building a Positive Mathematics Community - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"To offer younger students a taste of what is to come, we always find two or three problems that are appropriate for the students in fourth and fifth grades. These students spend several days working on each problem, and they also turn in submissions to be judged by a panel. They are encouraged to collaborate with parents, friends, and teachers.",,
13,Building a Positive Mathematics Community - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,STUDENTS' WORK AND RESPONSES,,
14,Building a Positive Mathematics Community - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,We are always gratified to see how energetic and enthusiastic students become as they work to solve the problems. The following describes a few problems from recent years and typical student submissions.,,
15,Building a Positive Mathematics Community - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"In one problem, students were asked to design a visual demonstration of the Pythagorean theorem. They used four congruent right triangles and a single large square (see 
  fig. 1

  ). Another team of two eighth graders decided to cut out similar pieces from wood to make a puzzle, showing the Pythagorean theorem in color. This entry was a prizewinner.",,
16,Building a Positive Mathematics Community - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,,,
17,Building a Positive Mathematics Community - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"For another problem, a group wrote a story about dividing oak casks filled with precious oil, drawing an image to illustrate how best to fairly divide the casks among three brothers. It, too, was a prizewinner.",,
18,Building a Positive Mathematics Community - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,FEBRUARY 14: THE BIG DAY ARRIVES,,
19,Building a Positive Mathematics Community - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"With several weeks of problem solving under their belts, students are ready for all the celebrations that occur on I Love Math Day. All day long, students from preschool through eighth grade will be thinking about math problems, playing math games, and doing all kinds of activities that involve counting and making patterns and every form of mathematical undertaking. Adults who love math and who use it in their careers and hobbies will be visiting the school. Students who participated in the problem-solving activities will have opportunities to share their best submissions and explain their thinking with fellow students and adults.",,
20,Building a Positive Mathematics Community - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Middle school students will meet a panel of two or three visiting adults who love math. They will hear the different ways that these adults use math in their jobs and in their other pursuits. Students will have an opportunity to ask the panelists questions, and students and panelists together participate in playful guessing games:",,
21,Building a Positive Mathematics Community - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,How many jelly beans are in a one-gallon jar?,,
22,Building a Positive Mathematics Community - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Will the guesses form a standard distribution around the correct answer? (Usually not),,
23,Building a Positive Mathematics Community - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"Will the adult mathematicians be better guessers? (Again, usually not)",,
24,Building a Positive Mathematics Community - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Why are the adult mathematicians such poor guessers?,,
25,Building a Positive Mathematics Community - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"An assembly after the panel discussion also provides an opportunity to give prizes and awards for the excellent mathematical work the students did in the problem-solving activities. Awards are given for the most creative solutions, the best explanation of a solution, the best teamwork, the most vivid video presentation, the most beautiful poster, and so on. The categories for awards should be varied and playful, the point being to publicly recognize great mathematical work in all its variety. Awards can be simple treats, candy bars, age- appropriate math books, math oriented calendars, and so on. A valentine is also appropriate because it is, after all, Valentine's Day.",,
26,Building a Positive Mathematics Community - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,I LOVE MATH DAY GROWS MATHEMATICIANS,,
27,Building a Positive Mathematics Community - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,"I Love Math Day has become a key element in Mustard Seed School's pursuit of a distinctive mathematics culture. With February 14 as a focal point, the students commit several weeks to working on rich, challenging problems. Through the effort to solve these problems, they grow as mathematicians. They seek to make sense of problems, develop strategies, critique strategies, work collaboratively, and create and test hypotheses. When they approach a solution, they spend additional time finding ways to explain their thinking and justify their solutions. Through creative presentations, they continue to reflect on mathematical content long after they find a solution. These important skills and traits will help students develop into proficient mathematicians. The celebratory culmination of their work provides an opportunity to continue thinking and talking about their work and engaging with adults who use math in their professions and in their leisure pursuits.",,
