18,Students with Learning Disabilities Tackle Multistep Problems,"Diffi culties with working memory can be minimized by the use of a strategic, visual organization of information. Students can use a table to break problems into manageable pieces so that full attention can be focused on each part of the problem, rather than trying to store information in memory while thinking about subsequent steps. If students learn some general thinking skills for separating multistep problems into smaller, more manageable steps, students with learning disabilities have better opportunities to solve such tasks (van Garderen 2007). Tables can provide students with a structure to organize the components of a problem and their thoughts in a systematic way as they begin the problems and throughout the rest of the problem-solving process. Students can use tables to store only the essential words needed for solving problems, so that they can better focus on the information they will need to complete each step. Tables also provide a visual that students can refer to when working on a problem that involves multiple steps.  anchoR MatheMatical discUssions",18,Students with Learning Disabilities Tackle Multistep Problems
19,Students with Learning Disabilities Tackle Multistep Problems,"To solve complex, multistep mathematics problems, it is useful for students with learning disabilities to have mathematical discussions anchored by a table. The table should provide a foundation for the conversation. The teacher and student should both refer to it to refresh their memory of what is  already known and to record and work through each step to answer the main question. Teachers can teach students how to have these mathematical discussions by modeling the discussions, using the table as an anchor, and practicing until this process becomes routine. The eventual goal is for students to learn to have these conversations in their heads and solve multistep problems independently.",19,Students with Learning Disabilities Tackle Multistep Problems
20,Students with Learning Disabilities Tackle Multistep Problems,"When learning this strategy for the  fi rst time or encountering new math content, students may be overwhelmed by the multiple steps in the problem and start to show signs of frustration or a lack of confi dence. Initially, such students may also feel self-conscious about using a strategy for problems when some of their classmates are using mental math. A good starting point is to help students make the connection between using tables in math class and how most people use tables as reminders in daily life (e.g., making schedules, writing important meetings on calendars, and so on). At this point, teachers can transition into the lesson and start talking about the problem by relating the task to a context with which the student is familiar. As the student begins to gain some confi dence and understand and relate to the problem, the teacher can move toward the mathematical context by asking such general, guiding questions as “What do we need to fi gure out?” When prompted, students will begin to develop a better understanding of how to fi ll in the table and what types of questions they need to ask them- selves about multistep problems.

21,Students with Learning Disabilities Tackle Multistep Problems,"With more practice, students will get better at organizing the information from a problem into a table and using it to organize their thoughts and work. The thinking process and methods for fi lling in the table will become routine, and they will improve at working through the math content in multistep problems. Students are often able to move from needing the guidance of a teacher to having internal conversations and fi lling in the table independently. At this point, they may be ready to learn how structures of tables may need to be modifi ed to match the structures of some problem types (e.g., adding rows or columns).
