125,Informing Practice: I-THINK I Can Problem Solve,It is important for the teacher to work through the chosen problems in advance and consider how students might	solve	them.	A	key	role	of	the	 teacher during the group work phase is	to	ask	questions	that	will	engage	 students	in	metacognition.	The	questions that accompany the I-THINK steps in figure 2	will	aid	this	process.	,125,Informing Practice: I-THINK I Can Problem Solve
126,Informing Practice: I-THINK I Can Problem Solve,"However,	identifying	questions	in	 advance	that	are	specific	to	the	task,	 such as those shared in the Jeff ’s Blocks	example,	are	important	when	 planning	discussions	with	students.",126,Informing Practice: I-THINK I Can Problem Solve
127,Informing Practice: I-THINK I Can Problem Solve,"I typically used I-THINK once a week with groups of two to four students.	I	pre-assigned	these	groups,	 using	two	different	methods.	Some	 weeks, I would assign mixed ability groups containing one above average, one below average, and one to two	average	students.	Other	weeks,	I	 grouped students with similar interests	and	mathematical	abilities.	The	 problems came from either curriculum materials or from “Solve It!” (a department	in	this	journal).	I	always	allowed	 students to use the three main visual aids—a graphic organizer, the note card,	and	the	poster	prompt.",127,Informing Practice: I-THINK I Can Problem Solve

131,Informing Practice: I-THINK I Can Problem Solve,Instruction should provide many opportunities for students to develop  their ability to communicate their mathematical thinking and reasoning	(CCSSI	2010;	NCTM	2000).	,131,Informing Practice: I-THINK I Can Problem Solve
132,Informing Practice: I-THINK I Can Problem Solve,"The I-THINK framework supports encouraging a thorough consideration of a problem’s context, posing explicit	questions	about	mathematical processes, and reasoning through cooperative	groups.	When	students’	 metacognition	is	identified	and	developed through mathematical discourse, teachers can facilitate a learning environment that directly addresses students’ mathematical problem- solving needs (Kramarski, Mevarech, and	Arami	2002).",132,Informing Practice: I-THINK I Can Problem Solve

134,Informing Practice: I-THINK I Can Problem Solve,"The use of I-THINK can meet these needs by giving students opportunities to	(1)	develop	greater	problem-solving	 and metacognitive skills and (2) make mathematical connections while they question,	share,	and	analyze	ideas	in	 cooperative	groups.",134,Informing Practice: I-THINK I Can Problem Solve
