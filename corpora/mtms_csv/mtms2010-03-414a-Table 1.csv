"Pattern blocks are often used in math class during geometry lessons to support concepts of shape, angle, tessellations, and symmetry. They are also used with fraction study (e.g., Lanius 2007; NCTM 2009a). Using pattern blocks to construct other larger geometric shapes can help students understand the relationships among various shapes. Algebraic relationships and functions emerge when students count blocks and measure figures. The activities in this article support the development of such geometric vocabulary as perimeter, area, sequence, and nonstandard measurement. ",2,mtms2010-03-414a,,

Ask students to make the smallest possible triangle using the red trapezoid pattern blocks. Then discuss how the angles of the trapezoid block form the angles of an equilateral triangle: The 60-degree angles form the triangle vertices and the 120-degree angles form the central angle (see fig. 2a).",5,mtms2010-03-414a,,
"The smallest possible triangle uses  (a) (b) three trapezoid blocks. The perimeter of the three-triangle can be measured using the length of a side of the green triangle pattern block as a nonstandard linear unit. In a similar way, the area of the three-triangle can be measured using the area of the green nonstandard block (Reynolds and Lillard 2006; Reynolds, Lillard, and Trowell 2008). Both the perimeter and the area of the three-triangle measure 9. Although the number of units is the same, the unit measures are in different dimensions. This situation will be discussed later in the activity.",6,mtms2010-03-414a,,
"Ask students to build the next larger triangle, and allow time for them to fully explore how many trapezoids they will need. One way is to use four of the previously discussed threetriangles (see fig. 2b). This iterative method can also be used to build any larger triangle in a precise, predictable manner. However, students may also build on a previous triangle by adding blocks around the perimeter or in other ways (see fig. 3a−c). When they have found the larger twelve-triangle, ask students to record the number of trapezoid blocks, perimeter units, and area units in the table on activity sheet 1. Ask them to continue building the next larger triangle. They may preserve their triangles by drawing them on triangle graph paper (available at http://www.8gr.org/free-docs/ isometric-graph-paper.pdf ). These drawings can be displayed in the classroom or reserved for the extension activities.",7,mtms2010-03-414a,,
"Students will continue building larger and larger triangles, measuring their perimeter and area, and recording these numbers in the table. Help students look for a pattern in the data in each column by thinking about what stays the same and what changes within each column of data. Encourage them to use this thinking to create a formula for each column that will predict what will happen with the pattern for the nth triangle. Discuss why the numbers 3 and 9 occur in the formulas, and why the variable n has an exponent of 1 in the perimeter formula but an exponent of 2 in the area formula. This will help students begin to distinguish between measures of perimeter and area and between constant and growing sequences. Eventually, they will be able to differentiate between linear and quadratic data.",8,mtms2010-03-414a,,
"rePeating tile sequences After completing activity sheet 1 and finding the formulas for the nth triangle, students can work on the “Repeating Tile Sequences” table on activity sheet 2. Ask students to view their twelve-triangle drawings from the previous activity, looking for embedded three-triangles. Challenge them to build a twelve-triangle with no embedded three-triangles. Examine the student designs carefully, as three-triangles can be embedded in several ways in a twelve-triangle, which will be examined in activity sheet 2. Students may want ",9,mtms2010-03-414a,,

"Introduce the concept of rep-tiles, which are shapes that can be joined to make larger replicas of themselves (NCTM 2009b). Ask students to use one trapezoid block as a model and create the next larger trapezoid that is similar (see fig. 4a). It is important for students to understand that rep-tiles are geometrically similar to each other but constructed with different sizes. This means that corresponding angle measures are congruent, and corresponding edge lengths are in proportion. Other trapezoids can be built ",12,mtms2010-03-414a,,

"(a) (b) that are not rep-tiles for the trapezoid pattern block, so students should carefully check corresponding measurements. (For more examples of rep-tiles, see http://mathworld .wolfram.com/Rep-Tile.html.)",14,mtms2010-03-414a,,
"Once students have created the  larger rep-tile, ask them to use it as a building block to create the twelvetriangle (see fig. 4b) and even larger triangles. Notice that this time the central angle is determined by six 60-degree vertices of the trapezoid pattern block, rather than three 120-degree angles.",15,mtms2010-03-414a,,
"A new sequence is formed by  considering how the rep-tiles increase in size. The first figure is a single trapezoid; the next larger rep-tile contains four trapezoids; and the third rep-tile contains nine trapezoids. As students enter the total number of trapezoids for each figure in the table on the “Rep-tile Sequence” activity sheet, they should begin to recognize the set of perfect square numbers. These numbers are created by multiplying a whole number by itself: 1 × 1 = 1,  2 × 2 = 4, 3 × 3 = 9, and so on.  table 1 These triangle sequences are using trapezoid pattern blocks.",16,mtms2010-03-414a,,

"Students may find another pattern by considering how many trapezoids will need to be added to make the next rep-tile. Begin with one trapezoid, add three more trapezoids, and then add five more. This growing pattern will continue by adding consecutive odd numbers of trapezoids. If desired, stop and point out that the sum of the growing pattern numbers is always a perfect square number— in fact, it is the square of the figure number. Take this opportunity to connect perfect square numbers with the geometric model of a square. Often students do not realize that the area of a square with whole-number sides is always a perfect square number, hence, the name. ",19,mtms2010-03-414a,,
"Students may then record the  perimeter and area of each rep-tile as in the original activity. Discuss the patterns in each column, considering what changes and what stays the same.

conclusion,21,mtms2010-03-414a,,
"This trapezoid-to-triangle activity, discussing both triangle sequences and repeating tile sequences, can be used in math class to introduce, support, or formatively assess the learning of the  concepts of such geometric vocabulary as perimeter, area, sequence, and nonstandard measurement. The sequence formulas derived during the activities can also be represented using function format or graphed on the coordinate plane. ",22,mtms2010-03-414a,,
"These activities provide bridges among concrete, visual, and abstract thinking as students model with manipulatives, record on dot paper, and look for patterns leading to formulas. The multistep approach helps build logical reasoning, encourages the formation of conjectures, and provides support for developing simple proof. The activity is approachable for all levels of students. The “Repeating Tile Sequences” activity can also challenge students of differing abilities.",23,mtms2010-03-414a,,
