"Most students attempted to write equations of the form y = 3x + 0 or y = x + 3. Those who initially said y = x + 3 were trying to capture the “+ 3” pattern but quickly realized that the  equation did not yield the desired increase. Another student who fi rst tried y = 3x, recognizing that the repeated addition would be captured in multiplication by 3, made this comment: ",18,mtms2012-03-436a,,
"When I put 1 into 3x, it gave me 3; and when I put in 2, it gave me 6. So I knew I had to add 1 [because the fi rst two box numbers are 4 and 7].",19,mtms2012-03-436a,,
The student thus reasoned that the equation must be y = 3x + 1.,20,mtms2012-03-436a,,
"When reviewing the answer,  the teacher noticed that almost all students had found a correct equation either on their own or with the help of classmates. Since the subscript notation was new, students had written their equation as y = 3x + 1 instead of bn = 3n + 1. They also needed frequent reminders about how to interpret expressions such as bn. The notation did  become more comfortable with use, and students learned to appreciate the fact that it helped them distinguish between arithmetic sequences and linear equations.",21,mtms2012-03-436a,,
"Some students may have diffi - culty making the connection between repeated addition (or subtraction) in an arithmetic sequence and its formal representation as multiplication. To probe students’ understanding, a teacher might ask those who have made this connection to explicitly discuss why the “+ 3” pattern is being represented as 3 times the number of boxes. (“When you use bn = 3n + 1, it’s like starting at 0. When you fi nd the fourth box, it is 0 to 4. That’s 4 increases of 3, so you multiply 4 by 3. You need to multiply to see the pattern.”) Other students can be asked to interpret and restate in their own words the connection between the two:",22,mtms2012-03-436a,,

"An unexpected discussion occurred as to whether bn = 3n + 1 and bn = 3(n - 1) + 4 could both be correct equations. Student justifications for bn = 3n + 1 have been shown above. Those who wrote bn = 3(n - 1) + 4 explained, “The first box number is 4. Then you add 3 every time beginning with the second, so you have to subtract 1 [from n].” One student suggested bn = 4n - (n - 1) and reasoned: 4n is the number of the sides of squares if you don’t connect them. But if you do, there are segments that are connected and counted twice. If there are 2 squares, there is 1 connected line; if there are 5 squares, there are 4 connected lines; if there are n squares, there are n - 1 connected lines, so that’s what you subtract.",36,mtms2012-03-436a,,
Students eventually agreed that  all three representations were equivalent.  Their flexible thinking about arithmetic sequences led to their natural inclination to simplify these algebraic expressions and establish their equivalence. Harless explained that the box-number sequence is an example of a general way to express a pattern. He then defined these terms: •	 Arithmetic sequence—Any sequence with a constant difference between the terms.,37,mtms2012-03-436a,,
•	 Constant difference—The fixed  number that is added. ,38,mtms2012-03-436a,,

"In the next lesson, students were asked to derive a formula for an arithmetic sequence, including fi nding the constant difference if given two terms of the sequence. (See fi g. 2.) After completing the table, most students claimed that the constant difference was “obviously” 4: “From a2 to a5, the sequence went up by 12. That took 3 steps, so it’s an increase of 4 every step.” (See fi g. 3.) After this discussion, the teacher summarized their work by writing the following: constant difference increase in sequence values thttht e number of steps it takes 23 11 5 2−5 2− 12",40,mtms2012-03-436a,,
"To fi nd a0, many students subtracted the constant difference of 4 from a1 = 7 and obtained a0 = 3. Kevin also suggested using the given term a2 = 11 and subtracting the constant difference twice so that a0 = 11 – (2)4 = 3.",41,mtms2012-03-436a,,
"By now, most students understood that a formula for this sequence would have the form an = 4n + 0. Eventually, Kevin derived the formula an = 3 + 4n.

"form of the nth term, some students realized right away that a0 would play a role in the formula. However, several others computed a0 as if it were an unrelated problem, then found the missing constant term of an = 4n + 0 through experimentation.

"At this point, students had essentially derived the slope formula on their own. They had also found an equation of a line, given its two points.

connection to lineaR eQUations,54,mtms2012-03-436a,,
"Students translated their experiences with arithmetic sequences into a genuine understanding of linear equations. This lesson began with the question in fi gure 6a. Students had trouble getting started on this exercise, even though they were capable of plotting points, because the notation (n, bn ) confused them. Harless listed a few points that would be on the graph. For example, the box number b3 = 10 corresponds to the point (3, 10) on the coordinate plane. Students began to see what was being asked and could complete the graph without further diffi culty. One student sketched the graph shown in fi gure 6b on the board. Notice how she fi rst plotted the points (n, bn) from the box-number sequence and then drew the line passing through these points. Students saw that these points appeared to form a line, which was what they had expected. When asked why they anticipated a line, they responded,  “Because they increase by the same amount each time.” When asked if this would be true for any arithmetic sequence, they said, “Yes, because every arithmetic sequence goes up by the same amount each time.”",55,mtms2012-03-436a,,
"Then Harless asked whether or not bn = 1 + 3n is an equation of this line. He reminded students that bn = 1 + 3n is an equation for the box-number sequence from their fi rst exercise and asked, “What does n represent?” (“It’s the number of boxes.”) “What would happen if we let n = 2.4?” (“We wouldn’t have a meaningful box number.”) He said that on the original graph with the points plotted, only the box numbers are represented; the values of n are the “counting numbers.” But on the graph of the line that connects the points, n = 2.4 is included even though b2.4 has no meaning as a box number. Therefore, the graph of bn = 1 + 3n is given by the discrete points (n, bn) only and not by the line passing through these points. ",56,mtms2012-03-436a,,
The teacher explained that to ,57,mtms2012-03-436a,,
Fig. 6 A knowledge of linear equations and subscript notation was required to complete this task.,58,mtms2012-03-436a,,

"(a) (b) account for all points on the line (not just those from the box-number sequence), they must replace n and bn with x and y. Thus, an equation of the line is y = 1 + 3x. To verify this claim, suppose x = 2.4. Then,  y = 1 + 3(2.4) = 8.2.",61,mtms2012-03-436a,,
"Students could see from the graph that the point (2.4, 8.2) is, indeed, on the line. They experimented with a few other noninteger values of x. The teacher then said that an equation such as y = 1 + 3x can be used as a point tester (i.e., to test whether any point on the coordinate plane is on the graph of the equation) (EDC 2009). Given this correspondence between an arithmetic sequence (e.g., bn = 1 + 3n) and a linear equation (e.g., y = 1 + 3x), Harless defi ned the slope of a line as the constant difference of its corresponding arithmetic sequence. For example, the line corresponding to the box-number sequence has slope 3, because the sequence has a constant difference of 3.",62,mtms2012-03-436a,,
"Next, students delved into pairs of problems like those in fi gure 7. They were asked equivalent questions in two different ways, fi rst in the language of arithmetic sequences and then in the language of linear equations.",63,mtms2012-03-436a,,
"Problem 1 was a familiar question, and most students found the formula =cn 555 + n easily. But some students, despite having a strong understanding of arithmetic sequences, struggled with the fact that the constant difference was a fraction. They converted it to a decimal approximation, as shown by the following response:",64,mtms2012-03-436a,,
"The constant difference is 0.67. To fi nd this, I found the difference between 21 and 31 and divided that by  the difference between the subscripts (24 and 39). That equaled 0.67, so the constant difference is 0.67. ",65,mtms2012-03-436a,,
"Rounding led to incorrect answers (for c0 and cn), but also gave the teacher an opportunity to discuss the merits of using exact values. Problem 2a went smoothly, with several students gleefully declaring, “It’s the same problem!” They realized that the points (24, 21) and (39, 31) on the line corresponded to the terms c24 = 21 and c39 = 31 of the arithmetic sequence. Thus, students used their results from problem 1 to immediately conclude that the line has slope 2/3 and the equation = +5= +5y = + = +5= +5y 5= +5 5y",66,mtms2012-03-436a,,
"Problem 2b of fi gure 7 prompted  students to make the connection between the start value c0 = 5 of the arithmetic sequence and the y-intercept (0, 5) of the corresponding line. The teacher did not yet introduce the term y-intercept in this lesson. Students readily recognized that “the line crosses the y-axis at 5. It’s the value of c0.” Thus, when later introducing the formal term of y-intercept, students will have a solid understanding of the concept, and the term will be easily connected to already established ideas.",67,mtms2012-03-436a,,
"Problem 2c was an application of the point-tester notion. All students were comfortable with it and, aside from those who converted their answers to decimal approximations, had no diffi culty with its implementation (see fi g. 8). Students continued to work on similar pairs of problems. They found the questions about arithmetic sequences more intuitive and easier to understand. Problem 2 is a typical question that students face when studying linear equations, but it required nothing more than a simple translation from the language of ",68,mtms2012-03-436a,,

Fig. 8 This student response used the equation that was derived as a point tester.,72,mtms2012-03-436a,,
Fig. 9 Flexibility was added to this problem in that arithmetic sequences allowed n to take on all integer values (including negatives).,73,mtms2012-03-436a,,
"Suppose you have an arithmetic sequence . . . , d-3, d-2, d-1, d0, d1, d2, d3, . . . ,  which extends infi nitely in both negative and positive directions.

"Students then worked on the  question in fi gure 9, which gave them more fl exibility when using arithmetic sequences by allowing n to take on all integer values (including negatives). Students felt comfortable with this problem, and the negative subscript did not present any diffi culty. They considered the number of steps  between –6 and 18 when fi nding the constant difference, which was 2/3. To fi nd d0, most students took 18 steps back from d18 = 17 by subtracting 2/3 × 18 from 17. Finding the formula = + = +5= +5 5= +5n was routine by this point. ",75,mtms2012-03-436a,,
"Finally, students were asked:  Suppose a line contains the points (-30, -12) and (10, 48). Find its equation.",76,mtms2012-03-436a,,
"Many approached this problem by first translating the given points to terms of an arithmetic sequence. One student commented, “I found this by changing it into a problem [an arithmetic sequences problem] not coordinates. Then I did the same things as the other problems.” Several students clearly articulated the correspondence between the line passing through (-30, -12) and (10, 48) and the arithmetic sequence with a-30 = –12 and a10 = 48. By this time, none of the arithmetic sequences posed a challenge, and students understood that they could recast the linear equations problem in the language of arithmetic sequences and then apply the familiar techniques (see fig. 10).",77,mtms2012-03-436a,,
