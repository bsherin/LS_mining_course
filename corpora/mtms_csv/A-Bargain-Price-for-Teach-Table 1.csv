5,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage,"Teachers’ knowledge of mathematics infl uences both the experiences that they can provide and the expectations that they hold for students. Possessing an adequate understanding of math is vital so that teachers can effectively teach concepts to students who have different backgrounds and abilities, implement worthwhile tasks, and elicit mathematical reasoning during classroom discussions (NCTM 1991, 2000). Middle school is a crucial transition period for students as they move from concrete to algebraic ways of thinking.

7,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage,"The sequence begins with a fairly routine task, the Department Store problem: ",7,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage
8,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage,A department store held a storewide 50 percent off sale on winter jackets yesterday. Emily found a jacket that she liked very much. She had a coupon that gave her another 10 percent off the already reduced price. She paid $90 dollars for the jacket. What was the original price?,8,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage
9,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage,This problem was given to a group of prospective middle school teachers  (called participants in this article) during the fi rst meeting of a required math course aimed at deepening their knowledge of teaching algebra. This problem was chosen because it— 1.  addresses a signifi cant  middle school topic; 2.  is likely to elicit common  misconceptions; and 3.  can be solved with a variety of strategies.,9,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage
10,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage,"The participants solve this problem  in various ways, describe their procedures, explain the reasoning behind their solutions, and evaluate different solution strategies. These skills are necessary for learning and teaching mathematics with understanding. ",10,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage
11,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage,"The first component of the sequence allows participants to engage in a discussion after the problem has been solved, thus giving them opportunities to justify and evaluate different solution methods. With the second component, participants examine students’ work and discuss common errors and misconceptions. The third component allows participants to design additional percentage tasks, with the intent of discussing the relative difficulty or instructional potential of those tasks with others. All these experiences help to develop the mathematical knowledge necessary for teaching percentage.  solving and Justifying in Multiple Ways Accurately solving the Department Store problem requires knowledge of real-life contexts in addition to mathematics. The real-life context involves understanding that the store will reduce the original price by the percentage listed in the advertisement. Therefore, the larger the percentage, the greater the deduction. ",11,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage
12,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage,The math knowledge applied to this problem includes the ability to represent the relationship between the original price and the actual cost after the discount represented by the percentage. Both kinds of knowledge are inherent when teaching about percentages. The multiple quantities embedded in the problem statement increase the conceptual challenge and the likelihood of bringing out common misconceptions.,12,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage
13,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage,"Participants were asked to work  in small groups and present their solutions to the class. Two different answers, $200 and $198, were offered, and the solutions were written on the board (see fig. 1). ",13,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage
14,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage,"Some participants checked their solution by substituting the answer in the problem; they discovered that $200 worked but $198 did not.  fig. 1 These two solutions were checked, revealing that $200 was the correct answer to the problem.",14,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage
15,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage,solution 1 $100 × 0.1 = $10 $100 – $10 = $90 $100 × 2 = $200  solution 2 $90 × 0.1 = $9 $9 + $90 = $99 $99 × 2 = $198,15,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage
16,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage,"However, it was not yet clear why $200 was the answer. One participant asked, “How did you know to use $100?” The individual finding the correct answer admitted that she just guessed and found that it worked. Several others said that they also guessed. Such admissions of guessand-check strategies provided the first opportunity for the instructor to talk about an important distinction.",16,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage
17,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage,"This distinction is, namely, between having the mathematical knowledge needed to do well on multiple-choice standardized tests versus being able to teach across various content domains in the middle school curriculum. The instructor asked if it would be acceptable for a teacher to say “I just guessed” when replying to her students’ questions about a solution. All agreed that it would not be appropriate or sufficient in the classroom.",17,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage
18,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage,"A good hunch might be enough for  students to guess the correct answers to multiple-choice questions. However, this level of understanding would not be sufficient for teachers because they should be able to explain the reason behind solution strategies in ways that are accessible to their students. Furthermore, guessing does not work well when the numbers in the problem are not multiples of ten or other familiar numbers. To explore this scenario, the instructor asked the participants,  “What if the paying price was $86 instead of $90?” No one was able to guess the original price before the  10 percent discount. This led to the class consensus that teachers needed to identify reasoning-based methods for solving percentage-related tasks. ",18,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage
19,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage,"After working on this problem for  a while, three methods with various degrees of explicit reasoning were shared at the board. The whole class worked together to improve the explanations of each strategy. For example, one participant first offered the following solution on the board: $90 ÷ 0.9 = $100, the reduced price $100 × 2 = $200, the original price ",19,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage
20,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage,"Several others questioned the  origin of the 0.9 and 2 because neither number was given in the original problem. The person who provided the strategy above explained it in the following way:  $90 is after applying 50 percent  off, then 10 percent. 10 percent  off means you still have to pay  90 percent. Therefore, $90 is  90 percent of the reduced price. So $90 ÷ 0.9 = $100 is the reduced price. Since the reduced price is 50 percent, or half of the original price, the original price is equal to $100 × 2 = $200.",20,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage
21,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage,This explanation satisfied some participants but not all. Some were unsure why division was used in the first computation. Another participant suggested that they think about the relationship in this way: ,21,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage
22,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage,"Reduced price × 0.9 = $90. So to figure out the reduced price, you will need to undo the multiplication with division. Therefore, the reduced price is $90 ÷ 0.9 = $100.",22,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage
23,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage,"Although this participant verbally explained the mathematical reasons,  the instructor recorded the first complete solution on the board as shown in figure 2a. A similar process was followed for two additional solutions offered. The resulting solutions are shown in figures 2b and 2c. ",23,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage
24,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage,"The three solutions in figure 2 represent arithmetic-based reasoning (see fig. 2a), algebraic-based reasoning (see fig. 2b), and pictorial-based reasoning (see fig. 2c), as well as different ways of working with percentages. ",24,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage
25,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage,"In addition to focusing partici- pants’ attention on the different features, the instructor also asked them to compare and contrast the similarity and difference among these three solutions. One participant pointed out that the first and third solutions were based on the same thinking process. Both worked backward from the sale price ($90), to the intermediate price ($100), to the original price ($200). However, the second solution worked from the original price (x) to the intermediate price (0.5x) and then to the final price ((0.9)(0.5x) = $90).",25,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage
26,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage,One issue that did not get addressed (but is worth noting) is the incorrect proportion between the  90 percent and 10 percent and $100 versus $200 in the drawings of the third solution. Discussing this issue will help raise teachers’ awareness of the possible misinterpretations that such drawings might cause.  addRessing coMMon eRRoRs and Misconceptions,26,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage
27,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage,"The second component of this instructional sequence draws middle school teachers’ attention to common errors and misconceptions when solving increase and decrease tasks involving percentages. Such analyses give teachers opportunities to learn how to address others’ thinking, identify conceptual difficulties, and respond to and validate partially correct ideas. The participants were given the  following problem: fig. 2 These three solutions to the Department Store problem demonstrate different solution paths.  $90 is 10 percent off the reduced price.",27,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage
28,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage,"100% – 10% = 90%; therefore, $90 is 90 percent of the reduced price.",28,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage
29,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage,So 0.9 × the reduced price = $90.,29,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage
30,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage,"Divide 0.9 on both sides: 0.9 × reduced price ÷ 0.9 = $90 ÷ 0.9 = $100. Therefore, the reduced price = $100.",30,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage
31,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage,"$100 is 50 percent of the original price, so the original price is $100 × 2 = $200.",31,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage
32,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage,(a) arithmetic-based reasoning,32,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage
33,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage,Let x = the original price.,33,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage
34,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage,The price after the 50 percent was applied would be 0.5x.,34,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage
35,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage,"After the 10 percent reduction was applied, the resulting price would be 90  percent of that already reduced price, or 0.9(0.5x) = 0.45x.",35,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage
36,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage,Therefore 0.45x = $90.,36,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage
37,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage,Solve for x: $90/0.45 = $200.,37,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage
38,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage,(b) algebra-based reasoning,38,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage
39,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage,"The $90 is 90 percent of the intermediate price; $10 is the 10 percent of  the intermediate price. So the intermediate price is $90 + $10 = $100. $100 is half of the original price, so $100 × 2 = $200 is the original price.  (c) pictorial-based reasoning  An item in a store is sold for $60.00 after the first clerk marked the item up by 50 percent and after a second clerk marked the new price up by 60 percent. What was the original price before the two markups? ",39,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage
40,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage,"In addition to the problem, participants were given four solutions written by their peers from the previous semester (see fig. 3). They were then asked to determine the validity of each solution strategy, identify the sources of the embedded errors and misconceptions, and explore how  these errors and misconceptions could be addressed. The prospective teachers commented that the solution in figure 3a was algebraic-based reasoning and that figures 3b and 3c were arithmetic-based reasoning.",40,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage
41,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage,"They concluded that figure 3d was  the correct answer because $25.00 was first marked up to $37.50 (i.e., $25.00 + $12.50 = $37.50) and then to $60.00 (i.e., $37.50 + $37.50 × 0.6 = $37.50 + $22.50 = $60.00). However, it was not immediately clear to some participants why figure 3d was correct because they were unsure what 1.6 meant. One participant said to  consider the intermediate price (i.e., the first markup price) as 100 percent: The final price was adding 60 percent to the intermediate price, so it would be 160 percent, or 1.6, of the intermediate price. This explanation helped the others understand where the 1.5  came from in the next step. ",41,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage
42,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage,"Trying to figure out why the solutions in figures 3a, 3b, and 3c were incorrect presented different types of cognitive challenges. The participants concluded that the student who provided figure 3a did not pay attention  fig. 3 Solutions of past participants were distributed so that the current group could identify the solution strategies.",42,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage
43,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage,(a) (b) (c) (d) to the context of the prices being marked up instead of being discounted: “Pointing out that the solution of $200.00 is higher than the final price might help the student realize his or her error.”,43,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage
44,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage,"The participants indicated that  the student did not recognize that the numbers of 50 percent and 60 percent were not based on the same base quantity or the same “whole” in  figure 3b. The 50 percent markup  was first based on the original price, and the 60 percent markup was derived from the intermediate price. The instructor pointed out that this error was very common. She emphasized that when solving a math problem involving a percentage increase or decrease, it is important to identify the quantity that represents the  100 percent.",44,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage
45,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage,She then wrote the following  statement on the board and asked the participants to fill in the blanks:  From 2 to 3 is ____% increase; from 3 to 2 is _____ % decrease.,45,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage
46,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage,"In the first statement, the increase of 1 is 50 percent of the base quantity of 2. In the second statement, the decrease of 1 is about 33.3 percent of the base quantity of 3. This brief activity raised participants’ awareness of the importance of the base quantity. ",46,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage
47,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage,"They then realized that figure 3c’s  solution also showed the same kind of confusion about the base quantity. The student who produced the work did not understand that the 60 percent markup was from the intermediate price, which was not the same as  60 percent of the final price. One participant gave the following example to illustrate this point: “$16 is the result of the 60 percent markup from $10, but 60 percent of $16 is $9.6.” ",47,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage
48,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage,The participants also noted that   the student needed to use the 60 per- cent first and then the 50 percent  when working backward to reach the original price.,48,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage
49,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage,designing additional  Math tasks,49,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage
50,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage,The last component of the sequence is to ask participants to design additional percentage tasks related to the Department Store problem containing different levels of complexity and difficulty. This activity gives them an opportunity to create curricular tasks and anticipate how these tasks might affect students’ mathematical reasoning and problemsolving strategies. Most participants had an easier time designing a less difficult percentage increase or decrease task by including only one percentage change or by including subquestions that take students through a complex problem step by step:   The price of a pair of sneakers is $80. How much will they cost after  applying a 20 percent discount? Draw a diagram to illustrate your solution.,50,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage
51,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage,"The group discussed how student- developed diagrams might help students see that 80 percent of $80 is the same as subtracting 20 percent of $80 from the $80. One participant suggested adding estimation with benchmarks such as 1 percent, 10 percent, 25 percent, or 50 percent of a given quantity. These additional subquestions on diagrams and benchmarks were likely to solidify students’ concepts of percent.",51,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage
52,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage,"Finally, they recognized that the Sneaker problem was easier than the Department Store problem because the percentage was based on a quantity that was already known. In the latter problem, the percentage was based on an unknown quantity. Such discussion also gave participants additional opportunities to examine the  structure of tasks and the embedded concepts at deeper levels. ",52,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage
53,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage,"Finding a harder task involving the percentage increase or decrease concept was challenging for participants because they needed to be able to anticipate students’ typical responses and possible obstacles. The participants disagreed about whether using unfriendly numbers (such as $4590 and 15 percent in the following task) would make it harder for students to solve:   Lian’s mom bought her a used car two years ago. Lian plans to sell it because she will not be able to take the car to college. Typically, the value of a used car depreciates about 25 percent at the end of the first year and 15 percent at the end of the second year. Based on these statistics, the car is valued at $4590 now. How much did Lian’s mom pay for the car? ",53,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage

63,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage,"Some participants felt that this  problem was difficult. It would not be easy for students to figure out what the first-year price would be, given that $4590 was 85 percent of that quantity. They pointed out that both $4590 and 85 percent were harder numbers to work with than $90 and 90 percent in the Department Store problem. Others felt that it would not be more difficult because it and the Department Store problem had the same mathematical structure.",63,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage
64,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage,"With the new task, the price at the end of the first year could be found by calculating $4590 ÷ 85 to get 1 percent of that quantity; then, that price could be multiplied by 100 to find 100 percent or by computing $4590 ÷ 0.85 directly. This disagreement allowed the instructor to draw participants’ attention to the research findings of how the type of quantities (whole numbers versus fractions versus decimals) affects students’ reasoning and choice of strategies (Kilpatrick, Swafford, and Findell 2001). For example, it was challenging for some middle school students to make sense of division, such as 90 ÷ 0.9 = 100, because of their previous experience with wholenumber division in which the quotient was always smaller than the dividend. Comparing statements such as •	 “90	is	200	percent	of	the	original	 price; find the original price” versus  •	 “90	is	90	percent	of	the	original	 price; find the original price” might help students see the reason why the answer for 90 ÷ 0.9 is larger. The class discussion ended here because of time limitations.",64,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage
65,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage,"As we reflected on this instructional sequence, Parker (2004) came to mind. She discussed using pictorial representations to deepen student understanding of percentages and proportion as they reasoned through the relationships among different quantities.

69,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage,"Source: Adapted from Parker (2004) gives an example of such a pictorial representation. It would also be important to highlight the use of the inverse relationship between multiplication and division operation in this case: The original price × 0.9 = $90; thus, the original price is $90 ÷ 0.9. This inverse relationship between multiplication and division has been identified by the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSI 2010) as an important fundamental concept for operations.  coRRecting Misconceptions",69,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage

71,A Bargain Price for Teaching about Percentage,"In our instructional sequence  with prospective middle school math teachers, they first examine different strategies and misconceptions commonly associated with increase and decrease problems involving percentages. Their knowledge about percentage is developed through discussing  various problem-solving approaches, addressing others’ thinking, and designing relevant tasks.
