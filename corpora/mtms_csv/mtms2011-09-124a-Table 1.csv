NCTM continues its tradition of capturing the essence of the history of mathematics education in the United States. Defining research and insights presented by John Dewey, Edward Thorndike,  D. E. Smith, David Kline, and Hans Freudenthal encompass over 150 years of mathematics education and are conveniently documented in this CD resource. Simply opening this book can save endless hours of searching for resources. ",8,mtms2011-09-124a,,
"As well as looking at the past, the seventy-second yearbook prepares its readers for the future. As the U.S. government becomes increasingly involved in education, the policies regarding standardization and accountability have received much attention. Mathematics education, past and present, is examined through the lens of the Standards-based era of education that currently defines this stage in our history. ",9,mtms2011-09-124a,,
"As teachers, how do we survive the  pressures of these changing times? I think NCTM has thrown us a life preserver. This book addresses key implications of the Standards-based era for teachers. Changes in teaching methodology, textbook selection, curriculum development, and materials are all clearly outlined for the concerned mathematics educator. Interwoven into the chapters is helpful information on modern advances in mathematics education, such as lesson study, Realistic Mathematics Education (RME), and teaching with  technology. I highly recommend this book for all mathematics educators.",10,mtms2011-09-124a,,

"Pattern blocks are commonly used to help students develop an understanding of attributes, equivalent fractions, and tessellations. The sixty pattern-block activities presented in this book creatively encompass all five of NCTM’s Content strands and are linked to NCTM’s Curriculum Focal Points for the middle grades. Some activities are designed for students who are working in teams of two or three; other lessons may be used individually or while students are in cooperative groups. Many of the activities can be completed in approximately fifteen to twenty minutes and have potential for extensions.",15,mtms2011-09-124a,,
"The book is visually appealing in an easy-to-follow and ready-to-use format. Each activity is presented on two pages: a teacher page and a student activity page. The teacher pages provide concise instructions, a suggested list of prompts and questions  to guide students’ learning, and simple ideas for extensions. The student pages have readable text, clear instructions, and a visually appropriate layout; these student pages could be used with a diverse array of learners.",16,mtms2011-09-124a,,
"Several activities within each strand are sequenced to develop skills progressively. Students encounter multiple representations: from concrete (pattern blocks) to pictorial (color, copy, draw) to numeric to symbolic (nth case expression). Students also create tables and write statements, particularly in the algebra and data strands. Spatial reasoning and visualization skills remain a strong focus throughout. ",17,mtms2011-09-124a,,
I recommend this book especially  for middle grades teachers who are looking for a ready-made resource to continue enhancing their instructional use of concrete manipulatives and multiple representations across the  content strands. My preservice teacher education students also enjoyed this book and have been inspired with the possibilities for enhanced lesson applications.,18,mtms2011-09-124a,,

The authors provide four in-depth, authentic, real-world tasks  on investing in the stock market, designing a golf course, exploring small business administration, and calculating the probability of  various carnival games. Each lesson, which is interdisciplinary in nature, allows students to make meaningful mathematical connections to other content areas and to the real world. ",23,mtms2011-09-124a,,

The procedural strategy did not discuss the learning that occurs in a conceptual manner. That fact bothered me from the time I opened the book. Why wouldn’t any math educator discuss how vital it is to teach for conceptual understanding? That is the foundation of my methods course. From there, the book lost me. Last, with the Common Core State Standards coming out, this book is outdated. ",31,mtms2011-09-124a,,
"I recommend that only experienced  teachers who understand the importance of conceptual learning refer to this book. It contains some interesting strategies that could be incorporated into solid, conceptual teaching but does not illustrate this form of teaching.

"In Hidden Harmonies, Robert Kaplan and Ellen Kaplan take the well-known Pythagorean theorem on a fascinating ride through time and space. They  describe a wide variety of places with which the Pythagorean theorem (or PT, as the Kaplans refer to it) has either a direct or indirect connection. For instance, in chapter 9 we are guided by the Kaplans (with the help of some big-time players such as Euclid, Legendre, and Brodie) to the conclusion that the PT is equivalent to the Euclidean parallel postulate.

"Although much of this book is  accessible to middle school students, I would not recommend it as required reading for any but the most talented of that population. However, this book would be a wonderful resource  for teachers of all grades who like to sprinkle a healthy dose of history into their lessons. Since the PT can show up in some very unexpected places, a teacher would not have to be teaching geometry to fi nd it useful.",40,mtms2011-09-124a,,
"Anyone who has previously had  the pleasure of sampling the writings of the Kaplans already knows the charm of their prose and will once again be delighted.

You will undoubtedly learn some new mathematics but, just as important, you will see much of the old stuff in new and inspiring ways.",41,mtms2011-09-124a,,

The need for such a text, as stated in the introduction, is backed up by statistics concerning students who learn to dislike, or even fear, math. Two types of classrooms are described as well as the different strategies that are used to help students learn mathematics (by employing critical thinking as well as a graphic organizer). The book then delves into learning styles based on Carl Jung’s learning theory and the Myers-Briggs Inventory. Numerous strategies are listed, followed by an explanation of why they work.",46,mtms2011-09-124a,,
