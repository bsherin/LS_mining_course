"Each lesson followed a common format. First, students learned about the game, including the history and background, as well as instructions for playing. Second, the teacher demonstrated the game to the class. Then students were placed in small groups of two to four, given appropriate game materials, and instructed to play. They were then introduced to a probability concept related to the game, either as an integral part of the strategy or as an experiment where data were collected as the game was played. Students collected and analyzed the data, and reported their results on the group worksheets as both short answers and longer explanations.",2,mtms2007-03-394a,,
"The lessons were designed and tested in prealgebra classes in a rural public middle school.

How many times do you have to roll 6 items alike to win the game?,7,mtms2007-03-394a,,
"Game 1: Hubbub (Native American) BOwL AND DICE (wA’LADE HAMA’GAN), A SIMPLE game  of  chance,  is  one  of  many  similar  games played  by  Native  Americans  (Culin  1992).  The Penobscot  Nation  in  New  England  called  it  hubbub because of the chanting that accompanied the two-sided “dice” being tossed in a bowl or basket. The dice used were carved from bone or antler or were animal teeth, peach pits, or small stones that had been engraved, burned, polished, or painted to distinguish the sides. For dice, we used lima beans that had been spray painted on one side, and plastic bowls were used to hold the beans. Players fl ip one of the beans like a coin to determine who goes fi rst, then that player tosses 6 bean dice in the bowl. The following scoring rules are used: •	 Six beans alike: 3 points and take another turn •	 A second six alike: 6 points and take another turn •	 A third six alike: 9 points and pass the turn •	 Five alike: 2 points and take another turn •	 A second fi ve alike: 4 points and take another turn •	 A third fi ve alike: 6 points and pass the turn •	 Less than fi ve alike or a nonrepeat on the second  or third toss: No points and pass the turn •	 Continue playing until one player reaches 50 points",8,mtms2007-03-394a,,
"This game is used as a context for defi ning simple probability. See the sample space on the “Hubbub Game  Exercises”  worksheet  and  the  questions given to students. First, students found the probability of 1 bean landing white or red side up as the (number of favorable outcomes)/(total outcomes) =  1/2.  Students  were  then  asked  to  construct  a tree diagram of the sample space. If they wanted 6 beans to land on the red side, this was one outcome  of  64  in  the  sample  space.  After  obtaining these  fractions,  students  either  used  the  fraction form  (1/64)  or  used  a  calculator  to  convert  it  to a decimal (0.015625) and discussed how small the probability  was.  In  both  cases,  the  class  concluded that these were small amounts, and this was a small probability. They also discussed the meaning of  “and”  in  P(all  red)  and  P(all  red,  again).  This gave  them  hands-on  experience  with  compound probability and even smaller fractions (1/64 × 1/64 = 1/4096). Students grasped the concept of probability and compound probability and were able to explain that the small probability of one toss of all red  became  much  smaller  when  considering  the probability of one all red and then another all red. with some encouragement, most groups were able to  answer  the  fi nal  open-ended  questions  that  required them to apply the concepts and communicate their mathematical thinking. See fi gure 1 for one group’s written report. ",9,mtms2007-03-394a,,

rians believe that it is the oldest game in the world (Hanson 2004). ,17,mtms2007-03-394a,,
"The  Arabic  word  mancala  means  “to  transfer.” The  game  is  played  by  transferring  small  playing pieces, usually stones or seeds, from one pit to another. In its simplest version, the game board is a patch of ground, and the pits are depressions dug into the earth. Mancala boards were usually carved of stone, wood, or ivory, and were sometimes elaborate  and  artistic.  Many  are  displayed  in  art  museums across the world. ",18,mtms2007-03-394a,,
"In  our  class,  the  boards  were  half-dozen-sized egg cartons (with three pits on each side), separate bowls were placed at each end, and the playing pieces were beans. (See fig. 2.) Traditional boards have six or eight pits on each side. The directions for the game are listed below.",19,mtms2007-03-394a,,
"•	 At  the  beginning,  each  pit  contains  four  beans, which  represent  seeds.  Players  alternate  turns. The  first  player  chooses  one  pit  from  which  to “sow” the “seeds.”  •	 Each bean in the pit is then placed, one at a time, into  successive  pits,  moving  counterclockwise around  the  board.  Beans  placed  in  the  kalaha, the “pit” at the end of the board to the player’s right, are counted as points for that player. Beans are not sown in the opponent’s kalaha.  •	 If the last bean in a play is placed in the player’s  own kalaha, he or she gets another turn.  •	 If the last bean is placed in an empty pit on the player’s side of the board, then he or she captures the beans in the opponent’s pit that is opposite the ending pit. All captured beans, as well as the capturing piece, are placed in the player’s kalaha.",20,mtms2007-03-394a,,
•	 The game ends when all the pits on one side of  the board are empty.,21,mtms2007-03-394a,,
•	 The winner is the player with the most beans in  the kalaha.,22,mtms2007-03-394a,,
Most  students  had  never  played  this  game  but caught on quickly. Each team of two played several times  and  collected  data  regarding  which  player started  first  and  which  player  won.  Students  were asked  to  conjecture  whether  there  was  a  relationship between starting first and winning the game. (See fig. 3.) ,23,mtms2007-03-394a,,
"The data were then combined for the entire class and  used  to  find  the  experimental  probabilities  of whether the starting player won or lost. Finally, students  were  asked  to  write  a  paragraph  describing the relationship of starting and winning in their experiment,  giving  them  an  opportunity  to  answer  a broad open-ended question and focus on reasoning skills. The experimental probabilities will vary, but examining the class data should lead the students to ",24,mtms2007-03-394a,,

This mancala activity explored basic experimental probability.  Further  explorations  could  require  students  to  develop  strategies  and  planning  about  distributing beans and choosing the starting pit. Mancala has been compared with the game of chess because of its extensive and intricate strategy possibilities. ,27,mtms2007-03-394a,,
Game 3: Toma Todo (Mexican),28,mtms2007-03-394a,,
"TOMA TODO, Or PIrINOLA, IS A GAME OF CHANCE from Mexico. Children as well as adults play toma todo  with  a  pirinola,  which  is  a  six-sided  top  usually  found  in  Hispanic  gift  shops  or  variety  stores (Krause 2000) (see the item on the right in fig. 4). Each  of  six  possible  outcomes  on  the  pirinola  is equally likely to occur. To win, each player must acquire all the beans from the other players.  •  To begin the game, each player has 10 beans and places 1 bean in a center pile. Turns are taken. A turn consists of spinning the pirinola and following the directions on the side that is faceup after the spin.",29,mtms2007-03-394a,,
"•  The sides of the pirinola contain this information: pon 1 (put in 1 bean), pon 2 (put in 2), toma todo (take all), toma 1 (take 1), toma 2 (take 2), and todos ponen (each player puts 1 in the pile).",30,mtms2007-03-394a,,

Shin stands for “put in,” meaning “put two objects into the middle.” Dreidels can be purchased at holiday stores and toy stores, and inexpensive plastic or wooden ones can be found. Players use pennies, nuts, raisins, or chocolate coins (gelt) as tokens  or  chips.  To  begin  the  game,  each  player places an agreed-on number of tokens in the center  of  the  table.  Each  player  spins  the  dreidel  in turn.  when  it  stops,  the  letter  facing  up  decides the action.

The game is played with three painted sticks, representing dice, which are tossed in a basket. The sticks  can  be  made  by  spray  painting  craft  sticks. The first stick is called the tsi’i (zeen) and is black on one side and one-half black on the other. The second stick is called nezhi (nezshi) and is one-half red on one side and one-half black on the other. The third stick is called tqelli (zelli) and is painted red on one side and black on the other. (See fig. 5 for a diagram of the colored sticks.) All players sit on the floor and alternate throwing the sticks. The three sticks are tossed  upward,  ideally  against  a  blanket  stretched overhead to resemble a staked buffalo hide, and the sticks that land in the basket are scored. Any stick not  landing  in  the  basket  is  ignored.  “Crossing” refers to sticks that intersect and results in higher scores. red crossing red is 5 points. red crossing black is 3 points.
