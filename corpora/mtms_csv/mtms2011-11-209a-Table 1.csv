"Each time the Panthers make a touchdown and an extra point  (7 points) or kick a field goal (3 points) during a game, Pete does the same number of push-ups as the team’s score. For example, if the  team scores a touchdown and  the extra point and later in the game makes a field goal, Pete will do 7 pushups after the first score and 10 pushups (7 + 3) after the second score. In the last game, the Panthers scored 3 touchdowns (plus the extra point with each touchdown) and 2 field goals, in some order. What would be the greatest number of push-ups that Pete would have to do throughout an entire game? What would be the fewest number of push-ups?

"The greatest number of push-ups Pete will have to do is 93; the fewest number is 69. The order the points are scored will determine the number of push-ups Pete will have to do. The ﬁ rst score will be added 5 times, the second score will be added 4 times, the third score will be added 3 times, and so forth. To obtain the fewest push-ups, assume that the lower-scoring events (ﬁ eld goals) happen ﬁ rst. Similarly, to obtain the most push-ups, assume that the higher-scoring events happen ﬁ rst.",7,mtms2011-11-209a,,
