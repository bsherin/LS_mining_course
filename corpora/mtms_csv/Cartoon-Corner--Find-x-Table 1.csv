2,Cartoon Corner: Find x,"FIND X 1. a.  Solve the problem in the comic  for Gabby.  4. Teacher: “lynn, come to the board and show the class how to isolate the variable in 3(x – 4) = –12.” lynn goes to the board, erases all but the x on the left side of the equation, leaves x = –12, and says, “Now x is all by itself.”   a. What is the lcM of 3x and 4x?   b. Solve the equation for Abdul.",2,Cartoon Corner: Find x
3,Cartoon Corner: Find x,"  b.  How do you know that your  solution is correct?   a.  What did lynn do that is   incorrect? 2. Teacher: “Hector, come to the  board to find x in 4x – 12 = 30.” Hector walks to the board, points to the x in the equation, and says, “Here it is!” Solve the equation for Hector.",3,Cartoon Corner: Find x
4,Cartoon Corner: Find x,"3. Teacher: “Suzie, in 17 – x = 3x – 7,  solve for x.”    Suzie: “Why should I solve for x? ",4,Cartoon Corner: Find x
5,Cartoon Corner: Find x,Why doesn’t x solve for itself?” Solve the equation for Suzie.,5,Cartoon Corner: Find x
6,Cartoon Corner: Find x,  b. Solve the equation for lynn.,6,Cartoon Corner: Find x
7,Cartoon Corner: Find x,"5. Abdul: “To solve =17,   where x ≠ 0, i need to find the  least common multiple of 3x and 1 4x. Gram, could you please help 12 me find the lcM?”  12 17 c.  check your solution by replacing  x in the original equation with your solution.",7,Cartoon Corner: Find x
8,Cartoon Corner: Find x,"CHALLENGE 6. The weight of box A is 4/5 the  weight of box B. if box B is placed on one side of a balance scale, it is balanced by box A and a  4/5 pound weight. How much does box B weigh?   Gram: “Are they still looking for the  17.",8,Cartoon Corner: Find x

10,Cartoon Corner: Find x,"SoLUTIoNS 1.  a.  Sample method: Adding –12   to both sides yields –x = –9. Multiplying both sides by –1 yields x = 9.  b.  Substituting 9 for x yields   12 – 9 = 3. Because 3 = 3, the solution is correct.",10,Cartoon Corner: Find x
11,Cartoon Corner: Find x,without doing anything to the right side.,11,Cartoon Corner: Find x
12,Cartoon Corner: Find x,b.  Sample method: Applying the distributive property on the left side yields 3x – 12 = –12. Adding 12 to both sides yields 3x = 0. Dividing both sides by 3 yields x = 0.,12,Cartoon Corner: Find x
13,Cartoon Corner: Find x,2.  Sample method: Adding 12 to  both sides yields 4x = 42. Dividing both sides by 4 yields x = 10.5.,13,Cartoon Corner: Find x
14,Cartoon Corner: Find x,3.  Sample method: Adding x and 7 to both sides yields 24 = 4x. Dividing both sides by 4 yields 6 = x.,14,Cartoon Corner: Find x
15,Cartoon Corner: Find x,"4.  a.  Sample answer: What you do to one side of the equation you must do to the other side. Lynn in effect divided the left side by 3 and added 4 to the left side  5.  a. 12x b.  Sample method: Multiplying  both sides of the equation by 12x yields (4)(2) + (3)(3) = (12x)(17). Simplifying both sides yields  8 + 9 = 204x. Further simplifying the left side yields 17 = 204x. Dividing both sides by 204 yields 17/204 = x. Therefore, x = 1/12 (or about 0.0833).",15,Cartoon Corner: Find x
16,Cartoon Corner: Find x,"c.  Sample check: Substituting 1/12  for x yields:  12( 12( ) + 12 =17, 17 ) = 12 17   Simplifying the denominators  yields  + = 17.",16,Cartoon Corner: Find x
17,Cartoon Corner: Find x,"  Simplifying the left side yields  1= 8 + 9 = 17. Because 17 = 17, the solution checks.",17,Cartoon Corner: Find x
18,Cartoon Corner: Find x,"x – x – 6.  Sample answer: The problem can be solved by setting up and solving this equation, where B = the weight of box B: B = (4/5)B + 4/5. Multiplying both sides by 5 yields 5B = 4B + 4. Subtracting 4B from both sides yields B = 4. So box B weighs 4 pounds.",18,Cartoon Corner: Find x
19,Cartoon Corner: Find x,FIELD-TEST CoMMENTS,19,Cartoon Corner: Find x
20,Cartoon Corner: Find x,"My sixth-grade prealgebra students demonstrated a variety of strategies when solving equations. To help Gabby and her friends solve the problems, my students displayed a range of algebraic skills, from isolating the variable and practicing guess and check to working backward and proving that solutions were correct by substitution. Integer rules and properties of equality were embedded in the practice problems, thus providing a review of multiple skills.",20,Cartoon Corner: Find x
21,Cartoon Corner: Find x,Lynn’s problem that resulted in   x = 0 prompted a rich discussion about the difference between no solution and x = 0. Students felt that Abdul’s problem 2/(3x) + 3/(4x) = 17  was easily solved using the LCM. Other students realized that clearing the fractions was even easier  and found that it resulted in 8 + 9 = 17(12x). Students quickly realized that they did not need to multiply 17 and 12 because in the next step they were going to divide both sides by 17.,21,Cartoon Corner: Find x
22,Cartoon Corner: Find x,"Finding box B’s weight proved to be interesting. Most students realized that A = (4/5)B, so (4/5)B + 4/5 = B. One student wanted to work with box A and calculated that A ÷ 4/5 = B, resulting in A ÷ 4/5 = A + 4/5. We compared the two processes, and students realized that the solution was the same. ",22,Cartoon Corner: Find x
23,Cartoon Corner: Find x,These problems provided a  wonderful way to allow students to persevere and discuss the mathematical practices!,23,Cartoon Corner: Find x

27,Cartoon Corner: Find x,"My math 8 students found this activity particularly engaging because of the cartoon’s effective use of middle school humor. Several of my students have struggled to learn mathematics in previous years, so this cartoon not only provided some levity but also  acknowledged that although learning math is not always easy, it can be fun. The students were inspired to create their own fun contexts for problem 6.",27,Cartoon Corner: Find x
28,Cartoon Corner: Find x,"Most students were successful with the first four problems. However, some errors occurred when students used inverse operations as shortcuts and did not verify whether their answers were reasonable, given the context. Problem 4 provided an opportunity to experiment with dividing both sides of the equation by 3 first, instead of distributing the 3 first, which served as a natural way  for students to discuss and critique their reasoning and strategies.",28,Cartoon Corner: Find x
29,Cartoon Corner: Find x,"In problems 3–5, many students chose to use graphing technology to represent and solve the equations. In problem 3, by entering Y = 17 – X and Y = 3X – 7 in their calculators, students were able to visualize the point of intersection as the solution and could verify it with the tabular representation. For problem 6, some students used pictorial representations or strip models to help them make sense of the problem. ",29,Cartoon Corner: Find x

32,Cartoon Corner: Find x,"I gave this activity to my seventhgrade and eighth-grade prealgebra and algebra students. Most students easily solved the first three problems, but only the older students were able to understand problems 4 and 5.",32,Cartoon Corner: Find x
33,Cartoon Corner: Find x,"Some students either did not  understand the jokes or did not think they were funny, so the students were encouraged to write their own jokes that other students their age might think were funny. ",33,Cartoon Corner: Find x

37,Cartoon Corner: Find x,"My eighth-grade algebra students had just completed a test on the use of negative numbers. The last thing that they wanted to do on a Friday was start a new chapter. This cartoon activity was a great way to make everyone happy. I could assess what they remembered from prealgebra about solving equations, and they could have some fun with corny, “punny” jokes.",37,Cartoon Corner: Find x
38,Cartoon Corner: Find x,"After discussing the issue behind the humor in the cartoon (and after I mentioned that I never use red ink), the students worked in pairs, completing as many problems as they could in fifteen minutes. It was telling to see how many problems that students could finish. ",38,Cartoon Corner: Find x
39,Cartoon Corner: Find x,"We worked our way through each question by discussing the humor, and several students worked through the problem on the board. They were able to easily find the value for the variable in the first four problems. However, the students were often unable to justify each step. For example, in problem 1, after subtracting 12 from each side to give –x = –9, they did not know why they could not just “cancel” the two negatives. Their lesson on the following Monday focused on using a two-column proof to justify each step as they solved equations.",39,Cartoon Corner: Find x
40,Cartoon Corner: Find x,"The few students who attempted  problem 5 wanted to multiply the two denominators to find the LCM but became confused about what to do with an x2. We reviewed finding the LCM and the GCF of two numbers, starting with 8 and 12. They found it interesting that you could multiply the two numbers and then divide by the GCF. By thinking of 3x and 4x as 3 • x and 4 • x, they noticed that x was a common factor. That helped them find 12x as the LCM.",40,Cartoon Corner: Find x
41,Cartoon Corner: Find x,The class wrapped up the activity by sharing other math jokes. For example: “Now just a minute! I thought yesterday you said x was 3.”,41,Cartoon Corner: Find x
42,Cartoon Corner: Find x,"Sometime later, I used the activity with my fifth-grade students who were working in a seventh-grade textbook. They had just completed a chapter on computation with negative numbers and solving two-step equations. We spent a few minutes discussing math humor; some did not realize that math can be a laughing matter. By the end of the class, many of the students were sharing jokes that they had heard.",42,Cartoon Corner: Find x
43,Cartoon Corner: Find x,"Pairs of students worked through  the first questions together. They plunged in, using the “steps” they had just learned, and were thrown by –x. “Can’t we just do it in our heads?” ",43,Cartoon Corner: Find x
44,Cartoon Corner: Find x,They thought of it as either “What do I subtract from 12 to leave 3?” or “What do I add to 3 to make 12?” They clearly remembered seeing problems in elementary school with a “box” to mentally fill in. They also remarked that they were glad that they had learned their fact families. Some of the students recalled thinking of the negative as “the opposite of ” and were able to reason through what the value of “x” had to be. We introduced the concept of multiplying each side of the equation by –1 to wrap up the lesson.,44,Cartoon Corner: Find x
