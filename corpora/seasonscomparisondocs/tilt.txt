The Earth orbits around the sun  It takes one year for it to go around  It  axis is tilted at an angle  Because the earth  axis is tilted sometimes the northern hemisphere is tilted toward the sun and sometimes it is tilted away from the sun  When the Earth is over here our hemisphere is tilted toward the sun and we have summer  When the Earth is over here it  tilted away and we have winter  Summer is warmer than winter because the Sun  rays hit the Earth more directly at a more direct angle  The light rays have to warm a smaller area of the surface of the earth   When light rays strike the earth at an angle they are spread out over a larger area
