This is the earth and this is the sun  The Earth rotates on its axis  It spins  It turns  When the Earth rotates sometimes our side of the earth is facing toward the sun  When our side of the earth is facing toward the sun it  warmer it  hotter so it  summer  The other side is facing away from the sun so it  winter there  Then when the earth turns so that our side of the Earth is facing away from the sun it  winter for us
