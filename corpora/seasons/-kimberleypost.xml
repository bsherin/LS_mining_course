bruce	So it's warmer in Chicago sometimes and colder in Chicago.  So why is that, why is it warmer in the summer and colder in the winter?
kimberley	Um, it's like how the Earth turns, I'm pretty sure
Bruce   Uh huh
kimberley	The Earth is like turning so that sometimes we don't get as much light as places that are warm during our winter
bruce	Mmm hmm.  Could you draw a picture of that, would that help?  Or would it be easier to describe it, somehow, with your, like how exactly is the Earth turning so that it
kimberley	Well it's like going around the sun, so the sun would be here, but, say that we were, well this is Earth and that we were facing it, we'd get like summer and sunlight.  But then, if it like, since it's always rotating, then if we didn't get the sunlight, and it hit more on this area, we'd have colder temperatures, like Alaska because we're far away
bruce	 So here, how is the Earth moving again?
kimberley	 It's like turning around it but it's also rotating itself
bruce	So it's some, so it's sort of moving and spinning and at some point it kind of ends up further away
kimberley	Yeah, when we end up on this s- yeah
bruce	So when we're right here, this is summer
kimberley	Mmm hmm, and this would be winter
bruce	'Cause we're on the other sid- we're sort of further away
kimberley	 And we're not faced toward it
