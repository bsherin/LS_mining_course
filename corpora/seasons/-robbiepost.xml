heather	Um, so, in that kind of thing, if we were gonna try and kind of relate that and what were learning about the world's climate, um, could you kind of tell me what the lab had to do with, you know, what we're learning.
robbie	Um, how, like, at the- why it's kind of colder in the winter and warm in the summer because you um, the sun  will hit at a different angle and, er, the sun will hit us at a different angle and there will be less direct sunlight so the intensity would be less and it won't be as warm.  And then in the summer it hits us at a higher angle and it'll be warmer.
heather	So that helps explains seasons.
robbie	 Right.
heather	And of course I want a picture if that's okay.  If you could kind of draw the picture of the seasons- yeah, that's right, so like, so definitely when it's wintertime we're not getting as direct sunlight and in the summertime it's more direct, so kind of maybe you could draw a picture of what it would look like.
robbie	 Here's the sun and here's the Earth and um . . . This is the equator and it hits the equator and it also hits some of the southern hemisphere.  And if this is the northern hemisphere, it's not getting as much direct sunlight on us as it is on the southern hemisphere and the equator and as it . . . 
heather	As it goes around, so 
robbie	As it goes around in the orbit . . .
heather	So when it's way over here 
robbie	Yeah, it'll be the other way around.
heather	'Cause we'll be, um . . .
robbie	'Cause we'll be facing.
