betsy	why is warmer, and I already asked you this question earlier, why is it warmer in the summer and colder in the winter?  Sorry.
beth	It's okay.  Um, because . . . Well, in the northern hemisphere,  yeah, I'm going to use this one, just using the northern hemisphere, because the Earth is on an axis and I'll draw it .  In the summer, it looks like this.  There's the northern hemisphere.
betsy	 Okay.
beth	And in the winter, well, it's on the other side but I'll just draw it here for the point of just kind of with the equator, this is the equator and in the winter it's more like this.  So the northern hemisphere is facing farther away from the sun so when the sunlight comes out the northern hemisphere is getting much more sun here in the summer, like it's getting more direct sunlight, see, like closer up.  And we're here, here's summer, it's coming, there's sunlight coming right through here and it's almost direct.  And in the winter, sunlight isn't nearly as direct, it's kind of glancing off, so, in the northern hemisphere it would be like that.
betsy	Okay, that makes sense.  And you said that  this would be summer and if we were to make a 
beth	 Yeah, it would actually come more like down here than it would end up like that but I'm just drawing them there . . .
