heather	if maybe you could tell me again um like why seasons, there are seasons, so why is it warmer in the summer and colder in the winter?
denise	 Um, because, the um, since the Earth is twirling  on the axis then this side of the Earth is like on- closer to the sun then in winter, it's further away from the sun
heather	 You know I want a picture
denise	 
heather	 Pictures are good because they help me understand what you're saying and they probably help you too 'cause like once you see it, it makes more sense
denise	 
heather	 So is this going to be winter or summer?
denise	 I think it's gonna be summer
heather	 Okay
denise	  [incomprehensible] the United States
heather	  You have to draw Chicago on there . . .I'm kidding. Okay, so, on the other side, it's winter?
denise	 Mmm hmm
heather	 Okay, so, um, so this is 'cause it's  rotating on its axis?
denise  Mmm hmm
heather So, okay, couple things.  One thing, you might have heard the first time, I don't know if that's what he said, is that when it's summer here  it's winter in A- it's, um, let's see, when it's summer here it's winter in South America which is on this side
denise	 Right
heather	 So how do we account for that?
denise	 
heather	 You don't know ?
