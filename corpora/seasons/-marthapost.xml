heather	I think you were pretty close last time, about the seasons and why we have seasons and why it's warmer in the summer and colder in the winter and why, um, while we have winter, Australia and South America have summer, and vice versa.
martha	 Um, I think that's because, like, the Earth is like tilted, and so like, it's tilted, like this way , then like the bottom part is tilted towards the sun and if it's tilted that way, then the sun can shine on this part so if the Earth was just like straight up and down, we wouldn't have seasons, it would, like, be the same, so . . . 'cause the Earth is tilted.
heather	 Okay, cool.  So could we draw a picture?  Of just like, you know, summer and winter.  That sounds right.
martha	  Okay, like, this is the Earth and the north pole, the equator, then . . .
heather	 So you can show me whichever one.
martha	 Okay, so this was the sun and, like, this is the Earth and it was tilted like,  which way, it got tilted this way towards the sun, then this part would be having summer . . .
heather	 Okay.
martha	 Like above the equator.
heather	 'Cause it's like, kind of like getting it  more directly.
martha	 Yeah.
heather	 Okay.
martha	 Yeah.  It'd be hitting here and this part would be like tilted  tilted under so it wouldn't- it'd have to travel farther to get to it and it wouldn't be as direct.  And so then as it switches, like, switches and then it's tilted towards- the top part's tilted away from the sun, so the sun hits the bottom.
