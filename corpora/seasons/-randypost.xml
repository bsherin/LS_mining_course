bruce	 Oh, I wanted to ask you another question that we asked last time which is why is it warmer in the summer and colder in the winter?
randy	 Uh, I don't know the answer to that one 
bruce	Do you have a guess?
randy	Why it's warmer in the summer and colder in the winter, hmm
bruce	I know you didn't cover this in class
randy	Yeah, um, maybe something to do with the rotation of the Earth?  I don't know
bruce	What do you mean by the rotation of the Earth?
randy	Like, um, well I don't know really [something], but like uh, let's say the sun's hitting right here and it keeps hitting there for a while and it takes awhile for it to turn, you know, and that's why it gets colder and colder because we're getting farther and farther away from the direct hit of the sun
bruce	 Mmm hmm
randy	And uh, that's why I think that it's summer in some places and winter in the other because, you know, , it's uh, the direct sun is hitting there and then that would make it summer and when it's farther away  it would be- see, that's weird, I don't know, because you can still see the sun in the winter, so I don't know, don't know how to answer that
