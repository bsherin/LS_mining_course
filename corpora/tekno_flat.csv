When the teacher had the students initially take three counters away I think more time should have been taken to establish that what was left - the 9 remaining counters - represented 9/12 in this context.  The teacher then compounded the problem by not guiding the students to understand how many counters would represent the fraction 1/3 in this context.  (In fact perhaps the teacher should have started the whole process by asking that question when the students had all 12 counters in front of them rather than asking them to take away 1/3 when there were only 9 counters in front of each student.)  The reason I think it's crucial to establish how many counters represented 1/3 of the 12 counters prior to modeling the subtraction was because it quickly became evident that some students interpreted the instruction to """"subtract 1/3 from what you have left there"""" as meaning take away 1/3 of the counters remaining - which of course would leave 6 out of the 9 counters that were in front of the students prior to the instruction.  That this is how some of the students interpreted the teacher's instruction was exemplified by Noel's response that she had 6 counters in front of her after subtracting 1/3.

Then when she asks Lawrence to help out he responds as though the problem were asking the students to take away one-third of 9/12 which is what the teacher then states at 1:35.  It is frustrating because 9/12 - (1/3 of 9/12 ) does equal 6/12 which is what Lawrence (and Noel) states.

In the teacher's exact words """"I asked you to take away one-third of nine-twelfths""""  The key word """"of"""" in there indicates that we are taking away one third of the 9/12.  The next sentence she says """"I told you to subtract one-third from that"""" which is simply not true.  She said to subtract one-third OF 9/12's which would be (2/3)x in algebra terms.  She keeps flipping between the two definitions.  This is aggravating.  These poor kids are going to be very confused.  They may be able to plug away at her worksheets but they are not likely to understand what is going on. """"",1

The instructions were confusing since she instructed the students to initially remove three. She could have told the student to set up nine pieces to begin with to move away from the idea of """"taking away from"""" in the beginning which was confusing.   Also taking one-third away from nine pieces is very different from 9/12 - 1/3. It appeared that the students were focused only on the numerator and not what would happen with the denominator in this case. The teacher was not clear at all about how to accomplish this task. The student who came up with the answer 6/12 was not validated at all for getting what appeared to be a correct answer given the instructions.  """"",1
tekno_complete,2,0,2,2512,7_1,2,   this is a tough way to approach this problem.  I think if she would add the phrase one third of 12 or use a common denominator of 12there might be less confusion. Even I thought she wanted to subtract a third of the 9 pieces.  It seems that some where along the lesson they did discuss one third of 12 but she needed to remind the kids.  I think eventually it will work but it is causing a lot of problems right now (one third of 12 vs. 9) for the students.  This would be a great opportunity to talk about common denominators and equivalent fractions.

She then told them to take away 1/3 of what was left.  This would actually be 3 chips rather than the 4 chips that would have been 1/3 of 12.  This was very confusing and actually incorrect.  I think she might have been better off if she used chips with different colors on each side.  This way she could have had the students keep all twelve in front of them but flip 9 over.  Then it might have been easier for them to see they were still dealing with twelfths and that 1/3 would be out of 12 rather than 9. ,2
tekno_complete,2,1,2,2516,7_1,2," I think this is a good example of how NOT to use manipulatives. The students had evidently created models for different fractional amounts of 12 but it was not clear from the teacher's questions and comments that the whole during this part of the lesson should have remained 12. Her directions to """"take 3 away"""" (instead of asking them to remove 1/4 of the set) from the original 12 led the students to redefine the whole as 9. Because she then asked them to remove 1/3 of the remaining circles without first defining 9/12 as the fraction to be subtracted from the students may have misinterpreted the problem. The first girl reported her answer as """"6"""" probably because she subtracted 1/3 of 9 pieces but because the teacher did not ask her to explain her thinking she missed the opportunity to clarify the problem for the class. Once the teacher finally did name the reamining set as 9/12 she was able to elicit a """"correct"""" response from one of the students. Again because she did not ask for any explanation of the process used to arrive at this answer the rest of the students missed an opportunity to compare their own thinking and solution to the teacher's task. When the teacher was working with the individual boy student he actually appeared to recognize his mistake as he showed the correct response. The teacher failed to recognize what he was doing because she did not ask him to explain what he was doing. This further confused the student as he was asked to take 4 circles (1/3 of 12) away from the remaining 6 circles he had on his desk. He appeared hesitant to do so maybe because he may have realized that he was working with a different number in his set.""""",2

I belive Trey followed the same process as Noel becasue when the video pans to him he had six tiles remaining  He knew he had already removed three which is why he only removed one more when the teacher reminded him that one-third was four tiles.  No wonder it was confusing.  She didn't understand what he had done.  In my opinion it gets even more confusing at about 3:20 into the video when she has the class start over.

It was very confusing about whether the teacher wanted the class to removing 1/3 of a whole or 1/3 of 9/12.  She kept switching back and forth between the two and using the two ideas interchangeably.  That was probably why the first boy got 6/12 - he took away 1/3 of the 9 pieces. """"",2

From the teacher's comment on the clip there is apparently at least one student in the class who was able to more quickly recognize the problem. It might have been helpful to have that student talk with others about how he/she was thinking. I am not sure the individual student working with the teacher in the clip understood exactly why 3 pieces was not 1/3 of 8. Some questions from the teacher asking him to tell how he determined his solution would have been helpful in understanding exactly where his understanding failed.

The teacher says he wants to see how many 2/3s go into 1/2.  This is different than what I'm told the question was (1/2 divided by 3/4).   It might be a little confusing because sometimes """"the whole"""" means 1 sometimes it means 1/2 and sometimes it means 2/3.  He makes a point of saying """"whole in this case"""" to try to keep the different wholes straight. """"",0
tekno_complete,1,0,0,3489,9_2,1,   Teacher allows student to come up to explain - then the teacher takes over.  I do not think this is good interaction with the students.  Students do NOT seem to be actively engaged in what he is saying.  As an adult this was confusing for me - so I would think it would be confusing for the kids. ,0

tekno_complete,0,0,1,3491,9_2,0,   First the question given above is different then what teacher is trying to solve. Teacher is trying to divide 1/2 by 2/3 which results in 3/4.  He is using semi-circles to explain the problem to students.  ,0
tekno_complete,0,None,0,3492,9_2,1,   This teacher had a student share his solution and then immediately corrected him and presented the right answer.  He didn't leave much room for the student to correct himself nor did the class have time to process what was wrong with the first one.  ,0
tekno_complete,1,0,1,3493,9_2,1,   Here the teacher is dividing a smaller fraction by a bigger one. Again he has the students represent this using circular pieces.  He shows them how to represent the problem with circular pieces and then how to look at the problem they've represented to come up with a solution.  His solution although drawn on the board shows the students the answer using the circular pieces so it is easy for them to then come up with an answer.   Here they see that dividing a smaller number by a larger one may mean that you have to look at the larger one in a different form. ,0
tekno_complete,0,0,1,3494,9_2,0,"   Here the teacher is using public discussion to solve a problem.  He asks for a student to answer and then lets the student who volunteered his answer to demonstrate with the fraction circles.  He uses the overhead and markers to visually depict the fraction circles and how they can help answer the question.  He also calls on students to provide their answers. """"",0
tekno_complete,1,None,0,3495,9_2,1,   The teacher allows the student with an incorrect answer to try to justify his answer.  This gets the student trying to explain and realizing that his answer can not work.  The teacher then shows the class how to get on the right track.  This may have been better if he had had a student introduce the right method and their reasoning instead of him doing it. ,0

tekno_complete,1,None,0,3497,9_2,1,"   The teacher didn't give the student an opportunity to explain his thinking even though the student was wrong.  Chances are there are other students with the same misconceptions and by sharing this information other students maybe able to clarify the thinking involved.  When the teacher takes over the demonstration and proceeds to draw the diagram on the whiteboard with the overhead pen and realizes his mistake and then cleans the whiteboard off the teacher has distracted the students learning and the teacher doesn't do anything to re-focus their thinking to the problem on the board.

Then he did not let student figure it out he just talked over him and left him standing there.  He was unprepared with the right kind of dry erase pen and got himself distracted which in effect took its toll on the class.  He did not instill his knowledge and command of the lesson. """"",1
