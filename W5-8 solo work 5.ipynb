    "1. Decide on a topic that you're interested in.\n",

    "3. Use a web browser to save the source of these pages to your computer.\n",
    "4. Load these pages into python.\n",
    "    * If you want, you can start by just reading in one of your saved pages.\n",
    "5. Extract the text from these pages in some useful form.\n",
    "    * You can do this by using beautifulsoup or regular expressions. \n",
    "    * You'll definitely have to do some poking around in the source of the pages first.\n",
    "6. Tokenize the text you've collected.\n",
    "    * You can do this however you want. You can use nltk.tokenize, or one of the tokenizers we have used in the course.\n",
    "    * You can use your own regular expressions.\n",
    "    * You can use a combination.\n",
    "7. Construct a frequency distribution of the words in your little corpus.\n",
    "    * Take a look. What do you think?\n",
    "8. Remove words from a stop list and look at the frequency distribution again.\n",
    "9. Finally, stem the words in your corpus and construct a final frequency distribution."
